# Documents-analysis-and-clustering


-This repo is a part of master degree project. <br> 
-A frequent problem is errors in the installation of the somoclu library (the least errors are on Linux). <br>

-The data folder is a folder for articles in the .json format and is the only one that must contain files before starting the application.<br>
-The contents of the other folders can be cleared, they are filled with the next execution of the action in the PROJEKT-mgr.ipynb notebook<br>
