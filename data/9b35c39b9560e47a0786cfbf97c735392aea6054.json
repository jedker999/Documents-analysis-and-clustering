            "text": "Background/Case Studies: A recent publication reported that red cell transfusions from previously pregnant female donors markedly increased the mortality of transfused male patients. The findings would-if true-have far-reaching clinical and administrative implications in the management of the blood supply. However, these results may have been influenced by biases introduced in the statistical analysis. Study Design/Method: We separately analyzed data from three linked blood donor and recipient cohorts including data from the US and Scandinavia, over long time periods. Patients were followed from the time of first red cell transfusion for the occurrence of both in-hospital and long-term mortality. We used separate Cox regression models to estimate the associations between number of red cell transfusions from a female donor, a previously pregnant donor, and a donor sex-discordant with the recipient-all treated as timedependent-and risk of death while controlling for total number of red cell transfusions received using a stratified Cox model. Analyses were performed for overall effect and stratified by recipient sex and age. Results/Finding: We included a total of 53,890 patients (5,654 deaths), 93,724 patients (8,519 deaths) and 918,996 patients (198,537 deaths with longer follow up) in cohorts I, II and III, respectively. There was no association between any of the donor characteristics and in-hospital mortality in any of the three cohorts (Table) . Hazard ratios per transfused unit from a parous female donor were all non-significant, ranging from 0.99 to 1.02. Results were similar for the effect of donor sex and sex-discordance on in-hospital mortality (Table) , as well as with long-term mortality in two of the cohorts (data not shown). Effect estimates did not differ with recipient sex, and/or age. Categorical analyses did not show negative effects in heavily exposed patients. Conclusion: In this joint analysis of data from three large cohorts of transfused patients, we found no evidence of an association between donor sex, or parity and either in-hospital or long-term patient survival. These null findings using a similar statistical approach across more than a million patients from heterogeneous clinical settings in different countries indicate that prior findings seem unlikely to reflect true biological effects.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Platelets are essential for optimal haemostasis and to preserve the endothelial glycocalyx in resuscitation from shock. However, the 5-7 day shelf-life of conventional room-temperature stored platelets means they are usually not available outside large hospitals. Cryopreservation at -80C in dimethylsuphoxide extends shelf-life to 2-4 years, with reconstitution in plasma requiring minimal time, specialised equipment or training. However, despite encouraging preclinical and phase I data, only one phase II trial, in which only 24 patients received cryopreserved platelets, has been published. The CLIP trial program is seeking to provide sufficient phase III trial data for regulatory approval. Study Design/Method: Between July 2015 and December 2017 in 4 hospitals, we enrolled cardiac surgical patients at particularly high risk of perioperative bleeding (identified using the TRUST criteria (Alghamdi et al., Transfusion, 2006) ) in the CLIP-I pilot trial (ACTRN12612001261808). Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either cryopreserved or liquidstored platelets if their treating clinicians decided a platelet transfusion was indicated. Cryopreserved platelets were prepared by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service using a method based on that of the Netherlands Military Blood Bank, a modification of the original protocol described by the US Navy. Results/Finding: In total, 121 patients were randomised, of whom 42 (35%) received a platelet transfusion. Study groups were well-matched at baseline. There were no significant differences in any effectiveness outcome, but there was a trend for the cryopreserved group to require fewer red blood cell units transfused (median [IQR] 2.5 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] vs. 4 [3] [4] [5] units, p=0.18). There was a trend towards the cryopreserved group having less blood in their chest drains at 24hr (median [IQR] 712 vs. 805 [591-1080]ml, p=0.27). For the composite outcome defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC), there was a trend to superiority in the cryopreserved platelet group (27.3% vs. 55.6%, p=0.07). There were no clinically important differences in any measured adverse events. Conclusion: In this pilot trial, cryopreserved platelets were associated with no evidence of harm and small non-significant trends to reduced requirement for red cell transfusion and reduced postoperative blood loss. In the light of this data and the clear logistic advantages of cryopreservation, a definitive study with a non-inferiority design testing volume of postoperative bleeding as the primary outcome is warranted. Improved identification of patients at high risk for a platelet transfusion using a platelet-specific transfusion risk prediction score will increase the efficiency of the phase III trial. was communicated, assuming all criteria remained acceptable including absence of MSM in the prior year, following telephone calls to a toll-free number; reinstated donors were also recruited for donation based on current eligibility. All reinstated donors were required to meet the same donor requirements as any other donor. Rates of ID markers in reinstated donors were compared by chi-square testing to the general donor population, both donating during 2017. Results/Finding: 520/22, 482 (2.3% ) donors returned to donate after their indefinite MSM deferral was removed; 7 donors had ID deferrals following reinstatement (2 confirmed syphilis, 5 anti-HBc-reactive on 2 occasions of which 3 had a 1x history prior to reinstatement and 2 had both anti-HBc reactives post reinstatement; of note, 1 anti-HBc reactive donor was also an incident HIV NAT converter). An additional 72 donors returned to donate after a subsequent 12-month MSM deferral of which 2/72 had ID deferrals following reinstatement; both had confirmed syphilis and one donor was also HIV (antibody+NAT) positive with acknowledged ongoing MSM. The overall rate for all ID markers for routine donors in 2017 was 0.4% (21,676/4,829,679 ) as compared to 1.3% (7/520) in reinstated indefinitely deferred MSM donors (p<0.01; Odds Ratio, OR 3.0; 95% Confidence Interval, CI 1.44-6.38), or 2.8% (2/72) in reinstated 12-mo deferred MSM donors (p<0.05; OR 6.3; 95% CI 1.55-25.84). Conclusion: Federally funded programs investigating variation in HBV, HCV and HIV prevalence and incidence have not yet detected significant changes, indicating comparable safety pre-and post-MSM policy change. However, review of MSM reinstated donors for all ID-markers versus general donors shows trends that require careful monitoring.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Recent assessments of massive transfusion protocol outcomes have identified early transfusion of plasma results in improved hemostasis, shorter ventilator times and increased survival. Infusion using a $1:1 of plasma to red blood cells has also demonstrated a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality. Freeze-dried plasma (FDP) products have been successfully used as an alternative to fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), however, current FDP products prepared in glass bottles have limited widespread adoption of FDP in environments such as the battlefield. A new FDP product (RePlas\u00ae) that is contained and reconstituted in a plastic blood bag, using $ 250 mL USP sterile water for injection within less than two minutes, has been recently developed. Study Design/Method: This was a prospective, paired, open label, singlecenter, dose-escalation phase 1 study to determine the safety of autologous infusions of whole blood (CPD) derived FDP or plasmapheresis (ACD) derived FDP into normal healthy subjects. Each FDP product was manufactured from a minimum volume of 270 mL of FFP. Three cohorts of 8 subjects per cohort were included (n=24), resulting in infusions of 270 mL (Cohort 1, n=4 for each CPD or n=4 for ACD FDP infusions), 540 mL (Cohort 2, n=4 for each CPD or n=4 for ACD FDP infusions) and 810 mL (Cohort 3, n=8 for ACD FDP and ACD FFP infusions). Cohort 3 was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study that compared the clinical and laboratory levels of thrombogenesis biomarkers after FDP vs FFP infusions. Clinical and laboratory follow-up was performed after 30 minutes, 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 and 28 days post-infusion. in vitro biochemical and coagulation parameters including pH, osmolality, aPTT, NaPTT, INR, Factors V, VIII, VIIa, protein S, antithrombin III, and total protein levels were also analyzed. A data safety monitoring board reviewed the subjects' data after the completion of infusions in each cohort. Results/Finding: To date, a total of 41 subjects have been screened and 28 subjects have been enrolled and assigned to treatment. For cohorts 1 and 2, all 16 subjects have been infused with FDP products. All FDP units were reconstituted in less than two minutes. For all subjects, no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to product infusion and no occurrence of predetermined, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including thromboembolic events, infections, evidence of unusual bleeding/bruising or elevated D-dimer levels have been observed. Physical examinations showed no significant changes in vital signs or Wells' scores. Four AEs not related to the FDP product infusion were observed in cohort 1 (rhinitis, transient weakly positive DAT, hyperglycaemia and transient mild increase of liver transaminases). No AEs were identified in cohort 2. No signs of either local or systemic allergic reactions were observed after infusions. Cohort 3 infusions are ongoing and the results of this cohort will be presented. Conclusion: Preliminary data suggest that RePlas\u00ae FDP is well tolerated in normal healthy volunteers with no SAEs or safety concerns.",

Study Design/Method: 156 individual mice in the F2 generation of a B6 \u00d7 FVB cross were analyzed with regards to: 1) 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recoveries (PTR), 2) high resolution metabolomics, and 3) SNP based genotyping. A phenotype driven backcross was also carried out; poorly storing progeny were crossed to B6 mice for 8 generations (B6.FVB congenic strain). New transgenic mice were engineered that overexpress Steap3 on their RBCs. Known human variants of human Steap3 were cloned and expressed in CHO cells and activity measured. Results/Finding: Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of F2 mice identified a 149 Mb region on Chr 1 associated with PTR (p=2.09x10 -31 ). B6.FVB narrowed this to 2.8 Mb containing 20 coding genes. mRNA levels were quantified for all 20 genes by RT-PCR in erythroid precursors. Only one gene, Steap3, showed significantly different expression in FVB and B6.FVB mice compared to B6 (p<.005 by 2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction). Steap3 has two mRNA transcript variants in mice. Comparing FVB and B6. FVB mice to wild type B6, transcript var1 was 8-10 fold higher while transcript var2 was 3 fold lower (p<.0001 and p<.05 respectively by 2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction). RBCs from both FVB and B6.FVB mice had twice the Steap3 activity and 7 fold higher protein levels than B6 RBCs. Overexpressing Steap3 in B6 transgenic mice resulted in a significant decrease in PTR of stored RBCs compared to wild-type B6 (p<0.001). Lipid oxidation correlated with poor PTR in the F2 cohort and refined clusters of oxylipins carried over into the B6.FVB strain and into Steap3 transgenic mice. Known natural variants of human Steap3 had a wide variety of activities. Conclusion: Multiple lines of evidence using different approaches identified Steap3 as a genetic element regulating PTR. Steap3 is a ferrireductase converting Fe3 + to Fe2 + suggesting a mechanism of promoting a Fenton reaction with ensuing oxidation of lipids. Humans and mice share a Steap3 orthologue that is 84.97% identical at the amino acid level. Both null mice and deficient humans have a similar anemia. To our knowledge, this report is the first indication of a role of Steap3 in the biology of mature RBCs. Human Steap3 variants differ in activity but have not been tested for RBC storage. Testing this hypothesis in humans would require studies of PTR of RBCs from donors with genetic variation of Steap3, or other genes involved in Steap3 based pathways.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Alloimmunization to non-ABO red blood cell (RBC) antigens remains a significant clinical problem in transfusion medicine. Presence of RBC alloantibodies can lead to delayed transfusion reactions resulting in significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Transfused RBCs represent a unique immune stimulus as they lack traditional pathogenic signals that stimulate innate immune responses. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the stimulation of immune responses to transfused RBCs remain unclear. Recent work in mouse models has shown that storage of RBCs prior to transfusion leads to a significant enhancement of alloimmunization. Further studies have independently implicated macrophages and the spleen as being critical for immune response to stored RBCs. Splenic marginal zone macrophages (MZMs) have been reported to not only stimulate innate immunity but also to promote adaptive immune responses to certain blood-borne pathogens. Additionally, Splenic MZMs specifically phagocytose intravenously injected apoptotic cells resulting in immune suppression towards apoptotic cell antigens. Uptake of apoptotic cells by MZMs critically depends on the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on their cell surface. Exposure of PS on the surface of RBCs increases with RBC age but is significantly enhanced by storage. We hypothesized that splenic MZMs phagocytose transfused stored RBCs and, unlike apoptotic cells, stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses to RBC antigens. Study Design/Method: To investigate the role of MZMs in RBC alloantibody generation, we utilized the HOD mouse model to compare alloimmunization in Wild-Type (WT) and Liver X Receptor \u03b1 (LXR\u03b1) knock-out (KO) mice. LXR\u03b1 is a transcription factor essential for the generation of Background/Case Studies: Prophylactic administration of polyclonal anti-RhD in women prevents maternal alloimmunization. However, under certain conditions, some preparations of anti-RhD have a paradoxical enhancement of alloimmunization. The underlying mechanisms behind modulation of humoral alloimmunization by anti-RhD are unknown. However, recently it has become appreciated that different IgG subtypes of antibodies may differentially regulate alloimmunity. Herein, we take a reductionist approach and passively immunize mice with monoclonal alloantibodies, whereby the antibodies have the same specificity but are different IgG subtypes, to test how IgG subtype regulates RBC alloimmunization. Study Design/Method: A new monoclonal anti-Duffy was isolated, sequenced, and class-switched into different mouse IgG subtypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3). Individual subtypes were passively infused into C57BL/6 (B6) mice followed by a transfusion of 100uL of packed, leukoreduced RBCs consisting of 50uL HOD and 50uL B6, each labeled with lipophilic dyes to allow tracking. HOD RBCs express an RBC-specific triple fusion protein consisting of hen egg lysozyme, ovalbumin (OVA), and human Duffy. Some recipients received an adoptive transfer of 10 5 OTII CD4 T cells, which recognize OVA contained within HOD, presented by recipient MHCII. Alloantibodies were assessed over 21 days and measured by flow crossmatch against HOD and control B6 RBC targets. Results/Finding: Passive immunization with 1ug of IgG2a or IgG2c enhanced anti-HOD alloantibody production (3/3 experiments, p<0.01), IgG2b led to a 3-fold increase, but neither IgG1 nor IgG3 modulated alloimmunization, compared to controls. Additional mechanistic studies focused on IgG2c. Passive immunization with IgG2c accelerated HOD RBC clearance from circulation at every time point analyzed, compared to syngeneic B6 RBCs. Additionally, IgG2c treatment led to a significant increase of HOD RBC consumption (p<0.05, 3/3 experiments), with increases observed in CD8 + dendritic cells (DCs), CD8-DCs, red pulp macrophages, and to a lesser extent plasmacytoid DCs and neutrophils. The cumulative effect of altered RBC consumption patterns in IgG2c-treated mice resulted in a significant increase in OTII proliferation (p<0.0001, 2/2 experiments). Conclusion: The current findings indicate that pre-existing anti-RBC alloantibodies can modulate future RBC alloantibody production. In particular, IgG2c enhances alloantibody production through accelerated RBC clearance and shifting the pattern of consumption to individual immunostimulatory antigen presenting cell subsets. The cumulative effect of these changes is enhanced CD4 T cell activation and proliferation which leads to increased RBC alloantibodies. As polyclonal anti-RhD contains multiple antibody subtypes at varying ratios, these finding may provide insight into why some preparations of RhD, under certain conditions, enhanced alloimmunization.",

Zimring *1 . 1 BloodworksNW Research Institute, 2 Sanquin Blood Supply Research, 3 Sanquin Research Background/Case Studies: In addition to the better known effector function(s), antibodies are also known to regulate primary immune responses; e.g. administration of polyclonal anti-RhD to prevent maternal alloimmunization. Attempts to generate monoclonal anti-RhD have been complicated; ironically, some preparations enhanced rather than suppressed in human trials. Likewise, administration of plasma derived anti-RhD has caused enhancement in some settings. The underlying factors and/or mechanisms that regulate enhancement or suppression are poorly understood. To investigate these processes, we used a tractable mouse model that expresses the K1 variant of Kell on RBCs, and allows transfusion of RBCs into antigen-negative recipients as an allotransfusion. Study Design/Method: A monoclonal anti-K1 was isolated and sequenced. Recombinant DNA technology was used to express the same anti-K1 variable domain as each of the different mouse IgG subtypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3). Isolated subtypes were infused into C57BL/6 (B6) mice followed by transfusion of one unit of K1 RBCs (50 microliters). Alloimmunization was measured by testing serum for anti-K1 IgM (at day 6) and IgG (at day 21) via flow crossmatch with K1 RBCs. Recipient mice included targeted deletions of the common gamma chain of FcgRs, FcgRI or FcgRIII. Both traditional and cellular surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were performed to assess affinity for IgG2a with the different FcgRs. Results/Finding: IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG2c (but not IgG1 or IgG3) significantly enhanced alloimmunization. For example, in combined data from 3 experiments, IgG2a treated vs. control mice had IgM (1693 vs 357, p = 0.02) and IgG (5926 vs. 6.9, p = 0.002). No enhancement was observed using antibodies against a third-party antigen. Likewise, no signal was detected in mice that received anti-K1 antibody but no transfusion. Additional mechanistic studies focused on the IgG2a subtype. Enhancement by IgG2a was lost in mice with a deletion of the common Fc gamma chain (FcgR -/-), suggesting that FcgRI, FcgRIII or FcgRIV (or some combination) was required for enhancement. Enhancement by IgG2a was eliminated in FcgRI -/mice but was unaltered in FcgRIII -/mice. Additionally, SPR analysis revealed affinity of IgG2a was highest for FcgRI (1x9x10 -8 ). These findings demonstrate that FcgRI, but not FcgRIII is required for IgG2a mediated enhancement of alloantibody response to K1 RBCs. Conclusion: The current findings indicate anti-RBC antibodies can influence humoral alloimmunity and this process is dependent upon IgG subtype. IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG2c each enhanced alloimmunity. Mechanistically, IgG2a enhancement requires FcgRI. Because enhancement is lost in FcgRI null mice, then none of the other FcgRs is sufficient for enhancement; but we cannot rule out that they may be involved.",

            "text": "Study Design/Method: A 'two-hit' rat model was developed using Lewis rats. Blood harvested from donor rats was used to make red blood cell units (RBC) following national blood banking practices. Under general anesthesia, a cardiac left-ventricular pressure transducer was placed. Isovolemic anemia was induced by replacing 25% of circulating volume with colloid solution. A large myocardial infarction was induced through ligation of the left-anterior descending coronary artery (first-hit). Animals were randomized (n=3 per group) to receive 1, 2 or 4 units of RBCs in 30 or 60 minutes (second-hit). Animals were followed-up to 1-hour post-transfusion. Primary outcome was difference in left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure (dLVEDP)gold standard for measuring increased pulmonary pressure (hallmark of TACO). Secondary outcomes include lung wet-dry ratio (WDR) and hemodynamic parameters. Results/Finding: Pre-transfusion LVEDP was 9.64 mmHg (IQR: 8.1 -11.1); following transfusion a significant increase in dLVEDP was seen between 1 vs. 2 and 1 vs. 4 units (resp.: p = 0.013, p = 0.013). While higher transfusion speeds trend towards higher pressures, this was not significantly different. Elevation of LVEDP above baseline persisted up to 1 hour after transfusion in the 2 and 4 unit group (ns.). WDR showed no differences between units or transfusion speed. Conclusion: This is the first animal transfusion model investigating the effect transfusion speed on pulmonary hydrostatic pressure, the key feature of TACO. A strong dose-dependent effect of transfusion volume on pulmonary hydrostatic pressure was found. While higher transfusion speed showed a trend towards higher pressures, it was not significant in this model. Future experiments in this model will allow testing of interventions and therapeutic strategies to prevent TACO. Background/Case Studies: Culture of residual components can detect septic transfusion reactions (STR). According to AABB criteria, signs/symptoms suggestive of STR include 1) fever (>/=38C with a rise >/ = to 1C) PLUS any of the following: rigors, hypotension, shock, tachycardia, dyspnea and/or nausea/vomiting -OR-2) isolated hypotension. Limitations of these criteria include that hypotension and tachycardia are undefined, fever may occur in the absence of other signs/symptoms, and fever may not occur in patients pre-medicated with antipyretics. The goal of this project was to develop improved criteria for detection of STR by culture of residual product in adult patients. Study Design/Method: We collected retrospective data for all transfusion reactions in adults ( > 15 years) that resulted in culture of the residual product during calendar year 2016. We also collected the same data for any reactions with positive residual product culture results from 2012-2015, to enrich the dataset for positive results. We modified AABB criteria to define hypotension as systolic blood pressure </ = 90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure </ = 60 mmHg -ANDdecrease of 15% from baseline; and tachycardia as > / = 100bpm -AND-15% increase from baseline. We also modified recommendations to culture when the fever was >/=39C in the absence of any other signs/symptoms or in the absence of fever when the patient was pre-medicated with an anti-pyretic and other signs/symptoms were present. We retrospectively determined the sensitivity and specificity of these Background/Case Studies: When a septic transfusion reaction (STR) is suspected, AABB Bulletin 14-04 recommends testing the returned product for bacterial contamination as well as drawing blood samples from the patient for culturing. Growing the same bacterial species from these two sources supports a diagnosis of STR. However, patient blood cultures can be negative in the setting of a true STR if the patient is on antibiotic therapy at the time of transfusion. This multicenter, retrospective, international study describes 1) the rate of patient culturing in the setting of product culturing and 2) organisms detected from these cultures. Study Design/Method: We collected data for all transfusion reactions with residual product culture during the calendar year 2016, including recipient demographic data, type of product implicated, and patient and/or product culture results. The data set was additionally enriched with all cases from 2012-2015 where product culture was positive. Imputability of the clinical significance of a positive product culture was defined as \"definite STR\" if the patient culture grew the same organism and \"possible STR\" if patient was not cultured or if the culture 1) was negative or 2) grew a different organism from the product. Results/Finding: Out of 1,174 transfusion reactions with product culture at 22 institutions, only 449 (38%) patients were concurrently cultured. Eighty-eight (7%) product cultures grew a bacterial organism. Of those positive product cultures, 13/88 (15%) had concordant patient cultures (\"definite\" imputability). The organisms implicated were either members of the skin microbiota (8/13) such as Staphylococcus spp. or of the gastrointestinal tract (5/13) such as Escherichia coli. In 6/88 (7%) cases, patient blood culture grew a non-concordant organism (Table) and in 46/88 (52%) cases patient cultures were negative (\"possible\" imputability). In the remaining 23/88 (26%) cases, the patient was not cultured (unable to assess imputability). Conclusion: A minority of patients had concurrent blood cultures obtained when a residual product was cultured during the workup for STR. Imputability therefore could not be assigned in 26% of positive product cultures. Isolation of the same bacterial species from the patient and the product allowed for assignment of \"definite\" imputability in 15% of cases with positive product culture. If transfusion reaction signs and symptoms warrant culture of the residual product, a patient blood culture should be collected concurrently to aid in interpreting product culture results. reporting rates were lower for plasma when compared to PLTs and RBCs (p<0.0001) , no difference in reaction culture rates by component type were observed (Table) . Survey results demonstrated marked variation in institutional culturing policies. The majority (13/20; 65%) of centers do not use published criteria for culturing STRs. Some centers allow culturing of residual units without medical director approval (7/20; 35%) and have no formal review process to trigger STR investigation (5/20; 25%). Centers that reported a historically clinically relevant STR had overall higher reaction culture rates (55.1% vs 18.3%; p<0.0001), suggesting recall bias may be a driver for increased culturing. Conclusion: There is marked variation in institutional practices surrounding culturing residual components to detect STRs. Historically reported clinically relevant STR appears to result in higher culture rates. There is opportunity for practice standardization.",

Prospective studies are needed to assess the utility of real-time predictive algorithms plus clinical interventions in preventing TACO in a large-scale hospitalized patient cohort. Background/Case Studies: Massachusetts blood banks have been required by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) to submit monthly transfusion activity and adverse reaction data to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hemovigilance Module since June, 2014. Such standardized statewide data collection allows for more comprehensive analyses, including the potential to generate local benchmarks. Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO) is currently of interest due to international discussions of proposed modifications to the current surveillance case definition. As a result of perceived local increase in TACO incidence, we examined data submitted involving TACO and report the findings here. Study Design/Method: TACO reactions (2015) (2016) (2017) meeting the NHSN case definition and imputability criteria of possible, probable, or definite from 70 facilities, were included. We analyzed by age, gender, product received, transfusion indication, hospital bed size, and selected clinical criteria using SAS 9.3. Rates were calculated per 10,000 units transfused.",

            "text": "Results/Finding: 205 TACO reactions were reported with a mean of 68.3/ year. Of these, 107(52%) were in females, 45(22%) were aged 50-59, and 51(25%) were aged 70-79 years. Notably, two were aged \u2264 18. Facilities with \u2265 300 beds reported 160(78%) TACO reactions, 23(11%) occurred in those with 100-299 beds, and 22(11%) in those with < 100 beds. The rate of TACO per 10,000 units transfused was 5.14 in facilities with < 100 beds, 0.88 in those with 100-299 beds and 2.01 in those with \u2265 300 beds. Indication for transfusion was documented for 124/205(60%), with \"medical\" 44% (n=54) being most frequent followed by malignancy 17% (n=21), internal bleeding 13% (n=16), hematologic disorder 10% (n=12), and surgery 8% (n=10). Seasonal variation was observed with the lowest incidence of TACO occurring in June and July. The rate of TACO increased from 1.64 to 2.08/10,000 units transfused over the study period. The three-year TACO rates per 10,000 units transfused by product type were 1.09 for plasma, 1.54 for platelets and the highest was 2.00 for RBCs. Conclusion: A modest increase in TACO was observed over the three-year period, as well as a bi-modal age distribution among cases. The seasonal variation and higher rate among smaller facilities provides guidance to target awareness and potential interventions. Limitations include a lack of external data validation and the possibility of inconsistent case definition interpretation and application.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The Norwegian hemovigilance system was implemented in 2004 as a voluntary reporting system, becoming mandatory for serious adverse events in 2007. In the Norwegian hemovigilance system, IBCT has been reported as a transfusion complication, even when the patient did not experience any symptoms. Study Design/Method: IBCT is defined as the transfusion of a blood component intended for another patient or the transfusion of a blood component which does not comply with the specified requirements. Clinical reactions and severity, as well as the cause of the errors were registered, including errors in ordering of the blood component, selection and issuing, labeling, testing and bedside patient identification. Results/Finding: In the period 2004-15 the Norwegian hemovigilance system received 240 cases of IBCT, including 104 cases of blood component transfused to the wrong patient and 132 cases of blood component not meeting the specified requirements. In four additional cases, the blood component both failed to meet the expected requirements and was transfused to the wrong patient. Examples of non-conformities regarding lack of specified requirements of the blood component are lack of irradiation when required and transfusion of incompatible red cells in the presence of previously identified red cell antibodies. Thirty-five of the reported IBCT occurred in patients under the age of twenty. In 28 of these cases the transfused blood component did not meet specified requirements. In more than 50 % of the total number of cases there were multiple errors. There were 26 reports on hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by IBCT, twenty of them ABO incompatibility cases and six cases caused by incompatibility in other blood group systems than ABO, even if the antibody was known prior to the transfusion. Nine of the ABO-incompatible blood transfusions were less severe reactions, ten were serious or life-threatening and three were fatal. Two patients with known anti-IgA had an anaphylactic reaction after the transfusion of a red blood cell concentrate. Most of the patients receiving an incorrect blood component had no adverse reaction. Errors were most frequently related to ordering of blood components by the clinical departments, selection and issuing of blood components by the blood bank and to inadequate bedside patient identification prior to the transfusion. One can assume that in all cases where the patient received a blood component intended for another patient, the bedside patient identity control was not performed according to the local guidelines. Conclusion: Errors occur in all areas of the transfusion chain and in a high number of cases multiple errors are made. Most cases of blood components transfused to the wrong patient could have been prevented if adequate bedside patient identification had been performed. The main cause leading to IBCT are errors regarding ordering of blood products and inadequate bedside patient identification. In patients under the age of twenty the main cause for IBCT is transfusion of a blood component not meeting the specified requirements especially irradiation. The Norwegian hemovigilance system has strongly recommended the use of electronic patient identification before transfusion to reduce the number of transfusions of a blood component intended for another patient, but only a few hospitals in Norway have implemented such a system. Background/Case Studies: Each transfusion entails the risk of an acute disturbance, be it febrile (F), allergic (A), and/or cardiorespiratory (C) at presentation. Although the overall odds of transfusion reactions (TR) are low and most are minor, respiratory transfusion reactions (RTRs) are likelier to be severe, and are the leading cause of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality. RTRs may be cardiogenic (transfusion-associated circulatory overload [TACO] ) and/or non-cardiogenic. The latter range from direct insults (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI] , or allergic bronchopulmonary transfusion reaction [ABTR]), to indirect manifestations of other injuries (bacterial contamination, or acute hemolytic incompatibility). If criteria are not met for these harms, and underlying disease progression is not playing a role, then the diagnosis of exclusion is transfusion associated dyspnea (TAD). TRs, and RTRs in particular, can be challenging to investigate in patients with complex comorbidities, and in the working environment with its information gaps. The extent to which TR patients present with multiple disturbances, and the extent to which reviewers can reach conclusions more certain than merely \"possible,\" is of interest to measure in TR investigations, and especially in RTRs. Study Design/Method: In the hemovigilance database of an academic adult healthcare institution (comprising 3 sites transfusing 55,000-65,000 components/year), consecutive TR were retrospectively analyzed for mode of presentation (F/A/C), with multiple modes of presentation counted as a measure of complexity. Final conclusion(s) and respective conclusion-specific certainty/imputability underwent review to gauge diagnostic confidence. RTRs were also analyzed for the number of conclusions reached per case, and for the frequency of TACO, TRALI, ABTR, and TAD as a conclusion (and their respective certainties). Results/Finding: Over 5 years (01/01/2013 -31/12/2017), 1691 TR were investigated by the transfusion laboratory team. Fever occurred in 764 cases, while RTR was noted in 346 (20.5%). Referrals with more than one disturbance (eg. F+C) occurred in 265 cases (15.7% of referrals). The provisional diagnosis in the TR referrals was ultimately no more certain than \"possible\" in 188 cases (11.1%). In RTRs, there were 451 conclusions reached, a value 30% greater than the number of referrals. When conclusions were stratified between those of low confidence [possible/cannot rule out] versus high confidence [probable or definite], the weight was low confidence-skewed in most RTR categories (95/80 in TACO, 24/0 in TRALI, and 113/22 in TAD, versus 52/65 in ABTR, respectively). Overall, the ratio of low confidence to high confidence RTR conclusions was 1.7:1. TAD was coded 135 times, and was the commonest conclusion after TACO. Conclusion: Overall, TRs present with more than one disturbance in >15% of referrals, while > 10% of TRs reach conclusions no better than \"possible\" for the likeliest (provisional) diagnosis. RTRs are comparatively more problematic, with more conclusions reached than there are cases, and the (TS20-MN3-23) Background/Case Studies: Babesia, a protozoan parasite that infects red blood cells, is a leading infectious cause of mortality in transfusion recipients, as reported to FDA. Babesia is usually transmitted via ticks but may be transfusion transmitted (TTB) or from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery. Prospective testing of blood donations in endemic areas of the US revealed 0.32% of donors were positive for Babesia DNA or antibodies. The US FDA does not currently require donor screening for Babesia but plans to issue draft guidance in 2018 with recommendations to reduce TTB risk, including requirements for screening blood donations. Study Design/Method: cobas \u00ae Babesia for use on the cobas \u00ae 6800/8800 Systems, is a highly-sensitive qualitative polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid amplification test (PCR-NAT), developed to detect in whole blood (WB) each year of screening under ID-NAT, MP-NAT, and with no screening in the context of the fifty United States and District of Columbia. Individual recipients' blood component exposures were sampled from data. Zikarelated adverse health events experienced by transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and infants born to recipients or sexual partners were captured. The model was run while varying the ZIKV rate from 1 confirmed-positive unit for every 1,000 blood units collected to 1 every 10 million. Estimate uncertainty was calculated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We assumed a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1 million per quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY). Results/Finding: We estimate that MP-NAT is only cost-effective in donor populations for which the ZIKV rate exceeds 1.3 positive units per thousand. Trigger strategies to ID-NAT are cost-effective in populations for which the ZIKV rate exceeds 7.7 per thousand. At a ZIKV rate of 1 per million, we estimate that transfusion-transmission of ZIKV would result in one case of mild febrile illness every 5.8 months (95% CI 3.9 -9.8 months), one case of Guillain-Barre every 336 years (95% CI 250 -476 years), and one case of congenital Zika syndrome every 694 years (95% CI 395 -4642 years) with no screening. Estimates of these outcomes at various ZIKV rates are reported (Table) .",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus related to Spondweni and Dengue viruses, spread by Aedes mosquitoes that can also be transmitted from human to human by sexual contact, from mother to fetus during pregnancy, and by blood transfusion. Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, but serious disease manifestations including neurological disorders and birth defects such as microcephaly, may occur. Zika disease became a threat to public health in the U.S. in 2016 when, in addition to travel-related cases, local transmission was reported in the continental U.S. The U.S. blood supply has been screened for ZIKV RNA since 2016 using investigational and later, FDA-licensed, nucleic acid tests (NAT) . Mutations in the viral genome may potentially negatively affect ZIKV blood screening by causing mismatches between the viral sequence and primers/ probes in detection by NAT. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the genetic diversity of human ZIKV isolates from the U.S. in 2016 and Panama 2015. Study Design/Method: Anonymized plasma samples were obtained from various blood collection facilities, and isolates were expanded by culture in Vero cells. Viral RNAs were purified from cell supernatants and sequenced using Sanger method. The complete ZIKV genome of 10 isolates collected during the 2016 epidemic in Puerto Rico and Florida were sequenced. In addition, we analyzed 3 clinical isolates from Panama, 2015. ZIKV sequences were aligned using Mega 7 software. The ZIKV genomes were also subjected to Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis. Results/Finding: Viral isolates from 10 blood donors collected in 2016 showed an average of 2.07% nucleotide divergence when compared with the ancestor Micronesia strain, 2007 (GenBank# EU545988). As usual among all flaviviruses, most nucleotide changes (>86%) were silent transitions (T$C, A$G). The number of nucleotide mutations ranged from 193 to 209 and resulted in 19 to 29 amino acid substitutions. Isolates from the same geographic location were genetically similar. Phylogenetically, ZIKV isolates from Florida clustered together with isolates from Honduras and Nicaragua, 2016. Isolates from Puerto Rico and Panama clustered with the Caribbean clade together with other isolates from Puerto Rico, Panama and Colombia, 2015-2016. Conclusion: The level of ZIKV genetic diversity observed in our study warrants further monitoring of ZIKV among the human population both to ensure suitability of the current licensed and investigational blood donor screening assays, and to determine whether ZIKV diversity may be associated with functional changes in the viral genes. Background/Case Studies: CD4 + CXCR5 + Foxp3 + follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells have been recently identified as a specialized subset of Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells, which locate in the germinal center (GC) and suppress follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, B cells and antibodies production. And Tfr cells play an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity diseases like SLE. Additionally, Baicalin, which is a natural compound isolated from Chinese herb, has been reported to promote Foxp3 expression during the differentiation of Treg cells and ameliorate kidney inflammation in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice. Thus, it is speculated that Tfr cells plus Baicalin might be a promising cellular therapeutic approach for the treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. In this study, it was determined that Baicalin could effectively induced CXCR5 + Tfr cells from Foxp3 + Treg cells, and these Baicalin-induced Tfr cells also could relieve lupus nephritis in mouse model. Study Design/Method: In vitro, naive CD4 + T cells were first purified from spleen of B6 mice, and stimulated by TGF-\u03b2 and Baicalin plus anti-CD3/28 Abs and IL-2, termed Baicalin-induced Tfr cells. And the phenotype, proliferation, serious cytokines productions and suppression of Tfr cells were assessed. Meanwhile, 1 \u00d7 10 6 Baicalin-induced Tfr cells or vehicle-induced Tfr cells were transferred i.v. into the MRl/lpr mice (12-week) once a week, which were lasting 4 weeks, and control mice were treated with PBS. The 24-hour urine protein were measured every week, and histopathologic test of kidney, anti-ds-DNA antibody titers and cytokines in serum and CD4 + Th subsets in spleen were analyzed after mice were treated with Tfr cells for 4 weeks. Results/Finding: After Baicalin induction 5 days in vitro, the percent of CXCR5 + Foxp3 + Tfr cells in CD4 + T cells increased significantly from 0.74 \u00b1 0.14% to 14.08 \u00b1 0.54%, and up to 48.57 \u00b1 2.93% of Treg cells showed CXCR5 positive and expressed high level of Bcl6, the key marker of Tfr cells. Baicalin could promote Tfr cell differentiation accompanied by inducing TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 production. Further, Baicalininduced Tfr cells could effectively inhibit Tfh cell proliferation, suppress IL-21 secretion and induce Tfh cell apoptosis in vitro. To determine the suppressive function of Baicalin-induced Tfr cells in vivo, the SLE mouse model were used. After 4-week treatment, a more remarkable anti-inflammatory activity, improved clinical renal scores and histological end-points in kidney were found in the Baicalin-induced-Tfr-treated group than those in the Tfr-treated group. The treatment of Baicalininduced Tfr cells could significantly decrease anti-ds-DNA antibody titers in serum and reduce 24-hour urine protein than Tfr cells treatment. Moreover, the transfusion of Baicalin-induced Tfr cells resulted in a more obvious decrease in the percentage of CD4 + CXCR5 + PD-1 + Tfh cells and the lower level of IL-21.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show promise for the treatment of trauma. Although their mechanism of action is not fully understood, MSCs possess properties which may limit post-injury damage and promote healing (such as anti-inflammatory/immune modulatory activity). MSCs can interact with and affect function of several immune cell types. In this study, we investigate interactions between MSCs and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) . ILCs are important rapid responders in infection and are likely to also be important in the response to trauma. Beyond the previously identified cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells, several non-cytotoxic subtypes have been described (ILC1, ILC2, ILC3). Different inflammatory/anti-inflammatory functions are proposed for the subtypes; thus the subtype ratio is important and may change with injury and treatment. In light of interactions between MSCs and other immune cells, we propose that they interact with ILCs, and that interactions will alter the function of both cell types. Study Design/Method: MSCs from commercial sources were used at early passage. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from de-identified human whole blood collected by the ISR Research Blood Bank under an approved standard operating procedure. ILC subtype identification was performed by flow cytometry. ILCs were enriched from whole blood using EasySep Human Pan-ILC magnetic enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies). Co-culture was performed in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 2-4 days. Non-adherent cells were subjected to flow cytometry for identification of ILC subtypes. Results/Finding: ILC subtype characterization in whole blood was performed on 8 individual donors. A high degree of variation between donors was observed. Magnetic enrichment of PBMCs increased the number of ILCs (11% of total events compared to 0.01% in unenriched PBMCs), allowing for more accurate ILC subtype characterization. When human PBMCs were cultured in the presence and absence of human adipose-derived MSCs, differences in subtype distribution were observed at 4 days (25.5% ILC1, 42% ILC2 and 32.5% ILC3 for PBMCs alone compared with 53.5% ILC1, 23.8% ILC2 and 22.8% ILC3 for PBMCs co-cultured with MSCs). Conclusion: Based on the current study, we conclude that ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 can be identified in whole human blood or PBMCs by flow cytometry. There is variability in the subset distribution between different donors. Enrichment of ILCs by magnetic separation allows greater accuracy for subtype identification by flow cytometry. MSCs influence ILC subtype distribution in co-culture. Since different ILC subsets have different functions, the interplay between these two cell types could have meaningful effects on immunomodulation.",

We seek to molecularly define antibodies involved in ABO carbohydrate blood group recognition. We investigated antibody somatic hypermutation levels, isotype makeup, and clonality of anti-ABO antibodies in healthy humans. We also assessed for the presence of stereotyped (convergent) antibodies expressed by different individuals. Study Design/Method: Using fluorescently labeled ABO antigens, we performed FACS to identify B-cells from healthy human peripheral blood with surface immunoglobulins specific for each blood group antigen. Once bulksorted, we performed high-throughput DNA sequencing of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain VDJ locus to characterize the ABO-specific antibody sequences. The sequences were then parsed and analyzed for specific antibody characteristics such as IGHV usage, CDR3 sequence, and IGHV mutation rate. Results/Finding: We discovered ABO-specific B-cells to comprise hundreds of clones, express all isotypes, and do not show evidence of IGHV gene restriction. The isotype make-up for anti-ABO antibodies comprise approximately 30% IgM, 30% IgD, 16% IgG, 14% IgA, and 10% IgE among the general population. The anti-ABO antibody response also appears to be polyclonal within individuals; for example, there is an average of 6177 anti-A antibody clones per group O person. Interestingly, as reported in prior literature, we have also found the existence of anti-self ABO antibodies (e.g. anti-A antibodies in group A individuals). We have found no evidence of IGHV gene restriction; there are no significant differences in IGHV usage among the ABO blood group antibodies and among different individuals. Furthermore, we have found that B-cells reactive to blood group A exhibit higher mutation rates than unsorted B-cells, for both IgM (2.1% vs 1.8% p < 2.22e-12) and IgG2 (9.8% vs. 8.1%, p < 1.7e-12) antibodies. Finally, we identified over a hundred convergent anti-A antibody clusters that appear in multiple blood group O individuals, exhibiting significantly higher mutation rates (5.75%) when compared to convergent anti-A antibodies found in individuals of blood group A (3.2%, p < 9.4e-04) and blood group AB (1.8%, p < 4.4e-06), but not in individuals of blood group B (4.4%, p < 0.21). Conclusion: Our data provides new molecular insights into anti-carbohydrate antibodies and may provide new avenues of studying these antibodies across diverse biomedical fields. These findings can potentially impact transfusion and transplantation medicine, and have direct relevance to clinically significant events such hemolytic disease of the newborn and organ transplantation rejection.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Humoral alloimmunization to HLA can lead to a refractory state in patients requiring platelet transfusion, problems for patients who subsequently require transplantation, and can also lead to TRALI caused by donated products containing anti-HLA. While alloimmunization to HLA requires exposure to alloantigen, how overall degree of MHC mismatch affects immunogenicity of individual alloantigens is unclear. Study Design/Method: C57BL/6 (B6) mice (H2 b MHC haplotype) were exposed to the K d alloantigen by infusion of leukocytes, but in different contexts: 1) K d in isolation on cells from a novel mouse that expresses K d as a single MHC alloantigen on a B6 background (B6-K d ), and 2) in the context of multiple other mismatched alloantigens (e.g. the whole H2 d haplotype) from BALB/c mice or congenic B6.H2 d animals. Alloimmunization was assessed by incubating serum with B6-K d or BALB/c targets, followed by florescent anti-mouse Igs and analysis by flow cytometry. Alloimmunization was calculated as mean florescent intensities (MFI). In some mice, the precursor frequency of CD4 +T cells specific for K d alloantigen was modified through 1) adoptive transfer of CD4 +T cells from T cell receptor transgenic mice (TCR75) specific for the immunodominant K d peptide presented by MHCII to CD4 +T cells or 2) immunization with the immunodominant peptide from K d . Results/Finding: Compared to control mice that had no detectable anti-K d alloantibodies (MFI = 0), a strong anti-K d response was observed after a single exposure to leukocytes from mice expressing the whole H2 d haplotype (MFI = 6267, n=10 mice over 3 experiments, p<0.001). In contrast, no significant alloimmunization was observed in response to K d as an isolated alloantigen, despite repeat exposure. Both adoptive transfer of na\u00efve TCR75 T cells and pre-immunization with K d peptide resulted in strong alloimmunization in response to subsequent infusion with leukocytes expressing K d as an isolated alloantigen, equivalent to leukocytes expressing the whole H2 d locus (MFI 13012, p < 0.0001). This was not an artifact of induction of anti-K d by maneuvers to increase CD4 + T cell numbers, as neither TCR75 nor peptide immunization induced detectable anti-K d on their own. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the immunogenicity of a single alloantigen is affected by the context in which it is encountered. In isolation, K d induced no significant alloantibody response; however, a strong anti-K d response is observed when multiple mismatches are present. The mechanism of this effect involved the magnitude of CD4 + T cell help. This challenges the notion that MHCI alloantigen is intrinsically a strong immunogen on its own, indicating rather that there is a cooperative effect between different mismatched MHC alloantigens when encountered together.",

It is possible that type 1 interferon signaling, which impacts alloimmunization in animal models, is in some way responsible for this altered CD64 expression.

            "text": "Oral Abstract Session: Product Manufacturing, Contamination, and Pathogen Reduction Background/Case Studies: Screening of platelet concentrates (PCs) for bacterial contamination is performed using an automated culture system. Since August 2017, the PC shelf-life was extended to 7 days with an improved bacterial testing algorithm: delayed testing at \u2265 36 hours post collection; inoculation of aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles; screening of double apheresis PCs with three aerobic bottles and one anaerobic bottle; and post-sampling quarantine at \u2265 6 hours. Contaminated PCs with negative screen results can be found through Quality Control (QC) testing of outdated PCs or reporting of transfusion reactions. Study Design/Method: From August 2017 to February 2018, 50,678 buffy coat (BC) pools and 9,434 apheresis units were screened during routine testing. In addition, 1210 outdated PCs were QC-tested. Positive results were classified as: \"confirmed positives\" if the same bacterium was isolated in initial and confirmatory cultures (implicated or associated components); \"false positive\" if no bacteria were isolated from positive screen cultures; \"unconfirmed positive\" if initial positive culture results could not be confirmed. \"False negatives\" if units had negative screening results but were positive during QC testing or were involved in septic transfusion reactions. Since March 2018, co-components associated to false positive results for BC pools have been released to inventory. Results/Finding: Thirty-three (0.07%) and three (0.03%) culture results were categorized as confirmed positives during routine screening of BC pools and apheresis units, respectively. Most bacteria (61%) isolated from BC pools were Propionibacterium acnes. Nine of the 33 confirmed positives (27%) involved an initial culture of a PC pool and confirmatory testing of associated RBCs, all contaminated with P. acnes. One of three confirmed positives for apheresis PCs was also identified as P. Background/Case Studies: Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV) are arboviruses transmitted by Aedes and Albopictus species mosquito vectors. As a result, their geographic distributions can overlap, resulting in areas where all three viruses are circulating at the same time. This co-circulation can increase the likelihood of patients becoming coinfected with 2-3 of these co-circulating viruses, as recently reported in several endemic countries. The large number of asymptomatic arbovirus infections raises the possibility of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). The risk of CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV TTI, whether alone or in combination, can be reduced by use of the photochemical INTERCEPT \u00e2 Blood System pathogen reduction (PR) technology, which has previously been demonstrated to be effective against multiple arboviruses including CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV. Here we report that treatment with amotosalen/UVA inactivates the combination of CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV in platelet concentrates (PC) and plasma. Study Design/Method: Plasma or PC in 35% plasma/65% platelet additive solution (PAS) units co-contaminated with CHIKV, DENV-2, and ZIKV were treated with amotosalen and UVA light. Infectious viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Inactivation was determined by comparing log titers before and after treatment. Results/Finding: Following amotosalen/UVA treatment, all three viruses were simultaneously inactivated to the limit of detection in both PC and plasma (see Table below ). This resulted in > 5.8 log (CHIKV), > 4.1 log (DENV-2), and >4.1 log (ZIKV) inactivation in PC and >5.0 log (CHIKV), >4.2 log (DENV-2), and >4.6 log (ZIKV) inactivation in plasma. These AMR in renal transplant pts, in general, carries an excellent prognosis, AMR in cardiac transplant pts denotes a poor prognosis and treatment options are less well understood and standardized. Study Design/Method: We reviewed the records of 63 heart transplant pts who were referred for immunotherapy, from 1/08-1/18, to treat AMR. The median age of pts (at time of rejection) was 55 years (19-71 years old), and 65% (41/63) pts were male. Pts presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure, diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction, and decreased ejection fraction (EF). 87% (55/63) pts had endomyocardial biopsy results consistent with AMR, and 92% (58/63) pts had evidence of circulating DSAs at time of rejection (including A23, A32, B35, B44, Cw7, DQ2-9, . 83% (52/63) pts had evidence of concurrent acute cellular rejection at time of AMR. All pts were DSA and T-cell crossmatch negative at time of cardiac transplant. Median time from transplantation to AMR was bimodal: 2.2 yrs (0.4-5.3 yrs) for 62% (39/63) pts, and 9.7 yrs (6.1-15.9 yrs) for 38% (24/63) pts. All pts received the following immunotherapy (IT) protocol: plasma exchange (TPE) every other day (or 3X/week) for 4-6 treatments (txs), followed by intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (1 gram/kg/day X 2 days). 83% (52/63) pts received high dose CS. Serial DSA measurements were obtained after each pharmacologic intervention. For refractory or recurrent AMR, 46% (29/63) pts received weekly rituximab (2-4 doses), and 27% (17/63) pts received twice-weekly bortezomib (4 doses).",

The most common DSAs present in refractory AMR included class II DQ2-9, DR4-8, and DR52-53. Pts with refractory AMR received monthly IVIG, with intermittent courses of TPE and bortezomib. Over a mean follow-up of 4.3 yrs (0.3-7.4 yrs) from time of AMR, 25% (16/63) cardiac transplant AMR pts lost their allografts to rejection, whereas over a mean follow-up of 5.9 yrs (0.4-12.3 yrs), only 9% (6/68) renal transplant AMR pts lost their allografts (p<0.04); both groups were treated with relatively similar protocols for AMR. Conclusion: Plasma exchange, IVIG, rituximab, and bortezomib are useful treatment modalities for cardiac transplant pts with AMR. Suppressing refractory class II DQ and DR DSAs may be critical to providing durable allograft rescue. The development of more effective protocols for treating refractory and recurrent AMR in cardiac transplant pts is needed.

Quantification of hemoglobin species is used to determine if goals of RCE have been achieved.

We performed an external validation of this formula with our SCD patients to determine the generalizability of this formula. Study Design/Method: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, we queried our institutional apheresis database to identify all RCE procedures performed in SCD patients from 1/1/2017 to 1/1/2018 with a pre-procedure HbS of \u2265 40%. Using pre-RCE HbS and pre-and post-RCE platelet counts, we applied the formula to our SCD population to derive an estimated post-HbS for each procedure. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was (260) performed to compare derived and actual post-RCE HbS values, and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results/Finding: We applied the formula to 163 RCE procedures performed on 42 patients. For 145 procedures (89%), derived post-RCE HbS was within 5% of actual post-RCE HbS as measured by high performance liquid chromatography quantification of hemoglobin species. There was no statistical difference between dFPR and FCR (p=0.87 pre-HbS=40-70%, p=0.53 pre-HbS>70%), or between derived post-RCE HbS and actual post-RCE HbS (p=0.73 pre-HbS=40-70%, p=0.53 pre-HbS>70%). Some inter-patient variation was noted, with 4 patients' RCE procedures accounting for over half (10/18) of all derived post-RCE HbS values with discrepancies >5% from actual post-HbS values. RCE performed emergently versus electively for maintenance therapy had no bearing on formula accuracy. Conclusion: The formula accurately approximated post-RCE HbS using pre-and post-RCE platelet counts for patients with pre-RCE HbS of \u2265 40% in our SCD patient population. In instances where traditional post-RCE HbS determinations may take considerable time, this formula may be used instead to expedite removal of temporary vascular access or time to discharge. Additional investigations are necessary to better characterize why this formula performs less well for a small proportion of SCD patients.",

A problem statement was developed, followed by process mapping, fishbone diagramming, and prioritization gridding. Solutions were proposed and discussed, then deployed toward end of 2017.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Heart transplantation is a curative therapy for end-stage heart failure. Limited organ availability often requires use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to bridge patients to transplant. VADs allow recipients to benefit from otherwise unattainable transplants, but are associated with complications such as increased HLA sensitization rates. HLA sensitization is associated with negative clinical outcomes post-transplantation, including increased rejection and increased mortality. VAD-associated HLA sensitization is a consequence of blood product transfusion associated with thoracic surgery, though factors that determine the incidence and extent of alloantibody formation remain undefined. To examine this, we examined VAD-associated transfusion effects on HLA-sensitization and subsequent transplantation. Study Design/Method: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 107 patients receiving VAD at an academic-based hospital from January 2014 to September 2017. Medical record data including transfused blood products, anti-HLA antibody testing, crossmatch testing, and time to transplant were evaluated. Categorical data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and quantitative data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. Multivariable analyses were performed using STATA software. Results/Finding: Patients received an average of 13.8 (range 0 -44) RBC and 1.9 (range 0 -8) single donor platelet transfusions associated with VAD surgery. There was a 28.7% increase in the incidence of HLA antibodies after VAD surgery (p=0.001), approximately a 2-fold higher rate than described in the literature among potential organ transplant recipients receiving transfusion. Multivariate analyses indicated development of new anti-HLA antibodies did not directly correlate with volume or type of blood product exposure, but was related to a patient's pre-VAD HLA sensitization status; the relative risk of new anti-HLA antibodies in VAD recipients with pre-VAD alloantibodies was 3.5-fold higher than in patients without prior alloantibodies (p=0.008). Development of new anti-HLA antibodies post-VAD were associated with an increased time to transplant (169 d versus 330 d, p=0.013). Conclusion: Our findings concur with the literature describing VADs as associated with increased rates of HLA sensitization. Uniquely, our study indicates that the presence of anti-HLA antibodies pre-VAD was the most significant risk factor for developing additional antibodies post-VAD. This suggests that a subset of patients may be predisposed to alloantibody formation and at increased risk for development of anti-HLA antibodies. Identification of at-risk patients is important to develop strategies to minimize HLA sensitization and prevent a potentially avoidable barrier to subsequent transplantation. Background/Case Studies: During their training, the majority of medical trainees will obtain informed consent for blood transfusion. Literature has demonstrated that informed consent for transfusion is at times incomplete, poorly understood, hurried and/or inaccurate in part due to lack of educational resources. A gold standard narrative would help ensure true patient informed consent and have utility in teaching trainees the risks and benefits of transfusion. Study Design/Method: A modified Delphi approach was used to survey a purposively selected international group of Transfusion Medicine (TM) experts with experience consenting patients for transfusion and critical knowledge regarding the risks and benefits of transfusion. A case scenario (a woman with gastrointestinal bleeding) was presented and participants were asked to draft a narrative (or script) for obtaining informed consent from the patient. Using the techniques of qualitative descriptive content analysis, a smaller steering committee of TM experts analyzed the scripts for core themes and topics. Common themes or categories were identified, (e.g. risks of transfusion, benefits of transfusion, etc.) as were specific topics/items (e.g. possibility of allergic reactions, possibility of HIV infection, etc.). Affective and structural content was also captured (eg. manner of engagement). A second survey was developing based on the collated topics and themes from the first survey. It was redistributed to the 24 participants from the first survey and 2 pilot participants. Participants were asked to rate each topics on a 6 point scale (1=very low importance; 6 = very high importance/essential). Content validity index (CVI) for each item was calculated. A narrative was developed using topics that scored a CVI of 0.80 or higher. Results/Finding: The survey was completed by 28 TM experts spanning 8 countries (4 as pilots and 24 participants). The majority of participants (>90%) have more than 5 years of experience practicing TM, of those, half have more than 15 years. Content analysis identified 10 high level themes and 97 specific topics from narratives that were included in the second round of the Delphi. The second survey was completed by 21/24 participants who completed the first survey, and 2 of the original pilot participants (88.5% response rate). Forty out of 97 topics with a CVI of 0.80 or greater were incorporated into a narrative that was developed to meet a Flesch Kincaid Grade level 8.7. There were 4 topics with a CVI of 1.00: Ask if patient has questions, Ask directly, \"do you consent to a blood transfusion\", Discuss that there are risks to transfusion and Discuss that the risk of transfusion transmitted disease is low.",

Plans are to further validate the narrative with other healthcare providers and patients using both surveys and focus groups to elucidate feedback and further refine the narrative. Background/Case Studies: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare human prion disease caused by infection with a bovine prion. Although all clinical cases of vCJD evaluated for the prion protein gene, PRNP, have been methionine homozygotes at codon 129 for 20 years, the first definite heterozygous vCJD patient, with Methionine/ valine (MV) genotype, was recently described in the United Kingdom. This patient met the diagnostic criteria for probable sporadic CJD (sCJD) but neuropathology and molecular analysis of prion strain type at autopsy confirmed vCJD. This recent publication underlined previous concern about a possible second wave of vCJD cases attributed to alternative genotype at codon 129 and secondary transmission. Iatrogenic transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion has already been documented in three recipients of non-leucodepleted red blood cell concentrates from donors in incubation of the disease. One additional probable case of vCJD transmission by blood transfusion was revealed at autopsy in a MV patient who died from a non-neurological disorder when vCJD prion protein was detected in his spleen. A highly sensitive and specific pre-mortem test to discriminate MV vCJD from sCJD is urgently needed to rapidly and accurately diagnose any future MV vCJD patients. Study Design/Method: Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) has already demonstrated high performances in the detection of vCJD prions in the blood of clinical patients and allowed the detection of silent carriage of prions before the clinical onset in two blood donors who later developed vCJD. This ultrasensitive technology was adapted for the specific detection of vCJD in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-PMCA) to identify vCJD infected individuals including the recent MV patient. Results/Finding: Among the 98 CSF samples analysed blinded to the diagnosis, CSF-PMCA identified specifically 40 of the 41 vCJD samples thus achieving a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] , 87. 1 -99.9 ). Importantly, this assay allows the discrimination of the heterozygous MV vCJD case from the 12 MV neuropathologically confirmed sCJD patients tested. CSF-PMCA also showed 100% analytical specificity (95% CI, 93.7 -100), with none of the 57 potentially cross-reacting CSF specimens from patients with sCJD, genetic CJD, Alzheimer's disease, and other non-neurodegenerative diseases giving a positive result. Conclusion: These results indicate that CSF-PMCA may allow the identification of MV vCJD in life and, in combination with other tests such as CSF real-time quaking-induced conversion, accurate discrimination from sCJD. The presence of infectivity in the blood of the first definite MV vCJD patient involved in this study is uncertain and requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Platelets can be cryopreserved at \u221280\u00b0C with DMSO, which increases their shelf-life from days to years. Cryopreservation of platelets results in a significant increase in exposed phosphatidylserine and the release of phosphatidylserine-expressing microparticles, which mediate their procoagulant function. Understanding the procoagulant nature of platelets, and defining the discrete phenotype of this population is an area of continuing interest, and contention, in platelet biology, where procoagulant platelets have been referred to as being activated, coated, apoptotic and necrotic. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether the phenotypic attributes of cryopreserved platelets align with the current definition of what constitutes a procoagulant platelet. Study Design/Method: Buffy coat-derived platelets were frozen at -80\u00b0C with DMSO (5% final concentration). Cryopreserved platelets (n=8) were thawed at 37\u00b0C and reconstituted with a unit of thawed plasma. In vitro testing of paired units was carried out prior to freezing (fresh) and after thawing (post-thaw), using flow cytometry and western blotting. Data were analysed using paired, two-sided t-tests, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant (*). Results/Finding: Phosphatidylserine externalisation was significantly increased in cryopreserved platelets, as measured by lactadherin and annexin-V binding. Mitochondrial damage was evident in the cryopreserved platelets, as evidenced by a reduction in tetramethylrhodamine (TMRE) sequestration. Cryopreserved platelets displayed higher intracellular calcium (Fluo-3AM) and superoxide anion formation (dihydroethidium [DHE] staining) than fresh platelets. Using western blotting, members of the intrinsic (Bak, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L ) and extrinsic (FADD, Fas, DR5) apoptotic pathways were differentially altered by cryopreservation, but the changes were not clearly indicative of a pro-apoptotic state. Activation of caspase-9 (FITC-LEHD-FMK) and cleavage of caspase-8 was greater in cryopreserved platelets. However, activation of the executioner molecule caspase-3 (Red-DEVD-FMK) was similar in cryopreserved and fresh platelets. Interestingly, cleavage of calpain-1, which is characteristic of procoagulant platelets, was observed in cryopreserved platelets. Conclusion: Cryopreserved platelets acquire many of the classic features that are used to define the 'procoagulant platelet', many of which overlap with the apoptotic and necrotic pathways. Further work is required to fully dissect the molecular events occurring in cryopreserved platelets and understand how these changes may influence clinical utility.

Lack of mechanistic analysis of the side effects of early HBOC formulations lead to the clinical evaluation of low molecular weight (MW) products, which failed due to a myriad of Hb associated toxicities not seen in pre-clinical trials. Increasing the MW of HBOCs can decrease these side effects by confining HBOCs to the vascular space and increasing nitric oxide (NO) generation via vascular mechanotransduction. HBOCs' advantages over blood include their nonimmunogenic properties and potential to use non-human Hb sources, among others. In this study we compare the efficacy of fresh blood or stored blood, with freshly synthesized polymerized bovine Hb (PolybHb) or PolybHb stored for 2 years in restoring cardiac function after hemorrhagic shock. Study Design/Method: PolybHb was synthesized in the low oxygen affinity (T) state with a 35:1 ratio of glutaraldehyde to bovine Hb, and then subjected to 8-9 cycles of diafiltration. This resulted in a PolybHb solution containing only polymerized Hb molecules < 0.2 uM and >500kDa. PolybHb was then frozen at -80\u00b0C and stored until used. Fresh red blood cells were prepared from the blood removed during hemorrhage by centrifugation at 1000g for 7 minutes, removal of the buffy coat, and removal of plasma until a hematocrit of 50%. Stored red blood cells were stored in AS-3 for 3 weeks after leukodepletion. were hemorrhaged for 50% of their blood volume, held in hypovolemia for 30 minutes, and resuscitated to recover blood pressure to 90% pre-hemorrhage with fresh autologous blood (fresh blood), 3-week-old blood, PolybHb generated within 3 months of the study (PolybHb 2017), or PolybHb generated two years prior to the study (PolybHb 2015) . Results/Finding: Shock resulted in impaired oxygen delivery and cardiac function. Resuscitation with fresh blood, stored blood, PolybHb 2017, and PolybHb 2015 restored cardiac function and systemic vascular resistance, but stored blood required significantly larger volumes to achieve this. Slightly higher volumes of PolybHb was infused compared to fresh blood before restoring 90% pre-hemorrhage MAP. Fresh blood and PolybHb fresh or stored did not impair cardiac contractility nor cause excessive vasoconstriction, relative to stored blood. Conclusion: Studies indicate that PolybHb is as efficacious as fresh blood in restoring cardiac function in rats after hemorrhagic shock. Additionally, PolybHb can be safely stored at -80\u00b0C for two years and retain efficacy, unlike red blood cells, which lose efficacy during storage.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Since their approval by Health Canada in 2008, all orders for Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs) at an academic tertiary care hospital required approval by a hematopathologist (HP), except during intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to its high acuity. In March 2014, after 6 years of experience, a pre-printed order (PPO) was implemented to streamline the HP approval process in other urgent warfarin reversal scenarios to simplify and expedite PCC administration. The goals of the PPO were to standardize PCC and vitamin K dosing, decrease turn-aroundtime (TAT), and reduce non-value-added calls to HPs. The purpose of this quality assurance study was to review PCC usage pre-and post-PPO implementation to determine the impact of the PPO in achieving its goals. Study Design/Method: A retrospective chart review of PCC usage was performed for two years pre-and post-PPO implementation (March 2012 -2014 and March 2014 . Relevant medical information, including PCC indication and dose, use of vitamin K, thrombosis events, and mortality were recorded. Appropriateness of PCC dosage was adjudicated using the Canadian National Advisory Committee (NAC) PCC guidelines. Appropriateness of PCC indication was adjudicated based on chart review. Bleeding episodes were verified by review of clinical notes, endoscopy reports, and imaging reports. Surgical start times were documented from the anesthetic record, with urgent surgery defined as less than 6 hours from PCC order. Results/Finding: Baseline characteristics of patients receiving PCCs preimplementation (n=207) and post-implementation (n=202) were similar, including sex, age, warfarin use, and INR levels. The proportion of patients receiving PCC doses within 500 IU of NAC guidelines was significantly higher in the post-PPO period (67.2% vs. 79.0%, p=0.015). The administration of at least 5mg of intravenous vitamin K was more frequent following PPO introduction (70.5% vs. 75.2%, p=0.015). No significant differences were observed in TAT, additional doses of PCC, red cell transfusion, INR correction, thrombosis, or mortality. After the introduction of the PPO, call volume to HPs for PCC approval was significantly lower (67.1% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001). The PPO was used to release PCCs for inappropriate indications 23.2% of the time: 15 cases for patients on warfarin for \"urgent surgery\" when surgery was > 6 hours from the PCC order; and 27 cases for patients not on warfarin without a HP consultation. Conclusion: Many of the goals of the PPO were achieved, with an increase in appropriate PCC dosing and vitamin K usage. The PCC ordering process was streamlined with a reduction in the call volume to HPs, preventing unnecessary delays in PCC administration. Although the PPO was used inappropriately in about one quarter of cases, these can guide refinements to the PPO to improve appropriate PCC utilization. Background/Case Studies: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show tremendous promise for the treatment of military and civilian trauma, based on their ability to regulate inflammation and promote wound healing. In this study we implement an assay designed to compare the angiogenic potential of MSCs and other cellular therapy products and investigate the relationship to cellular metabolism. Study Design/Method: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human MSCs (BM-MSCs, AD-MSCs and UC-MSCs) were obtained from commercial sources. mRNA isolated from early passage HUVECs from transwell co-cultures was used to generate cDNA. HUVEC expression of genes related to angiogenesis (VEGF, FLT4), tissue factor (TF), signaling and metabolism (TSG-6, OSGIN1, BBC3, JMJD8) were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Tube formation assays were performed on HUVECS plated onto Geltrex LDEV at sub-confluent densities in the presence of conditioned media or in co-culture with MSCs plated in transwell inserts. Angiogenesis was determined by quantitation of tube formation using Image J. Expression of HUVEC cellular proteins from transwell co-culture were visualized by Western blot and quantitation with an Odyssey scanner. Bioenergetic analysis via extracellular flux measurements were carried out on confluent cells in a Sea horse XFe 24 bio-analyzer. Results/Finding: HUVECs respond to MSCs with increased TF protein expression as well as increased expression of angiogenic mRNAs. Co-culture with BM-MSCs or AD-MSCs for 24 hr. altered the bio-energetic profile, increasing both the oxygen consumption ratio (OCR) and the spare respiratory capacity of the HUVEC cells. Co-culture with either BM-MSCs or AD-MSCs increased tube formation by HUVECs (22% and 40% increase, respectively). Conditioned medium from umbilical cord-derived MSCs was less potent in this assay. Conclusion: We have used the tube formation assay, qRT-PCR, Western blot and bioenergetics analysis to evaluate the angiogenic potential of MSCs and other cell therapy products. Preliminary results suggest that potency differences exist between MSCs derived from different tissue sources. Direct contact between HUVECs and MSCs is not required for stimulation of angiogenesis by MSCs, suggesting that a paracrine mechanism is primarily responsible. Evaluation of the bio-energetic profile in the co-cultured samples allows investigation of the relationships between angiogenesis and cellular metabolism. Increased angiogenic activity is accompanied by increased TF expression, potentially increasing thrombotic risk of MSC therapy.

Panch 1 . 1 National Institutes of Health, 2 NHLBI Background/Case Studies: Allogeneic transplant is the only curative treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, related donors for SCD patients have at least a 50% probability of having sickle cell trait (SCT). Mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) SCT donor grafts are often cryopreserved after collection. To ensure successful posttransplant outcomes, thawed PBMNCs must contain an adequate quantity of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Study Design/Method: Data on 102 mobilized PBMNC grafts, thawed for transplantation of SCD patients, were reviewed. Grafts from donors with SCT (SCTD) (n=78) were compared with normal healthy donor (NHD) grafts (n=24). Data was further stratified by products immediately cryopreserved (IC) post apheresis or those held overnight at 4\u00b0C for delayed cryopreservation (DC) (3 vs. 20 hours; p=1.4x10 -42 ). Results/Finding: Mean post-thaw (PT) total nucleated cell (TNC) viability (79% vs. 83%; p=0.06), TNC viable recovery (VR) (73% vs. 81%; p=0.01) and PT CD3 + (T-cell) VR (73% vs. 84%; p=0.09) showed trends towards being lower in SCTD compared to NHD. However, no difference was noted in PT CFU-GM (60 vs. 75; p=0.2) and PT CD34 VR (86% vs. 88%; p=0.7). Stratified data (Table) showed significantly lower PT TNC viability and T-cell VR with DC compared to IC in SCTDs. PT CD34 VR and PT CFU-GM were similar in the 2 groups. In NHD, only PT T-cell VR was lower with DC. Post-transplant, no differences were seen between SCTD and NHD grafts or between IC and DC grafts based on time to platelet and neutrophil engraftment. The duration of cryopreservation did not impact PT CD34 VR in either the SCTD or the NHD grafts (r 2 = 0.03). Conclusion: PT TNC viability and PT T-cell VR of SCTD grafts were lower than NHD grafts, especially for grafts which underwent DC. PT HPC recovery, in-vitro colony forming capability and post-transplant platelet and neutrophil engraftment were unaffected. This is likely due to the inherent durability of HPCs compared to T-cells. To ease logistics, DC of SCTD grafts may be feasible. However, caution must be exercised regarding product holdovers, given the definite decrease in overall viability. Further if donor lymphocyte infusions are planned from cryopreserved-thawed PBMNCs, dosing by PT viable CD3 + counts may be useful. Background/Case Studies: Umbilical cord (UC) blood can be cryopreserved for long term storage and functional hematopoietic progenitor cells, recovered after more than 20 years, are suitable for use as source material for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation (Broxmeyer et al, 2011) . Advances in iPSC technology include development of a variety of cGMP compatible, transgene-free approaches for reprogramming that can be used to generate iPSCs from small amounts of peripheral or UC blood (Zhou et al, 2015) and translated to automated platforms (Paull et al, 2015) . The UC tissue is rich in MSCs which are easily expanded ex vivo without compromising attributes considered important for future clinical applications. We explored the utility of UC tissue, cryopreserved as a composite material in a newborn stem cell bank, for iPSC reprogramming using integration-free reprogramming methods with translation to a semi-automated platform for iPSC colony isolation and subsequent culture. Study Design/Method: UC tissue was collected from consenting mothers and cryopreserved as a composite material. MSCs were isolated from thawed tissue by explant outgrowth as described (Skiles et al, 2018) . Cell lines were expanded and reprogrammed into iPSCs using the NYSCF Global Stem Cell Array\u2122 (Paull et al, 2015) with footprint free modified mRNA encoding transcription factors and nuclear GFP (nGFP). Reprogramming was also performed in parallel using CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai reprogramming kit. iPSCs were expanded under automation and quality controlled for sterility, mycoplasma, pluripotency, karyotype, identity, and differentiation potential. Results/Finding: UC cell lines were expanded on an automated platform and passed quality control tests in preparation for reprogramming. Two methods of iPSC reprogramming, mRNA and Sendai Virus, were validated leading to the generation of successfully reprogrammed iPSCs. UC cells displayed a strong ability to be transfected with mRNA encoding nGFP however the success of mRNA reprogramming was limited and high toxicity observed. Tra-1-60 expression confirmed the presence of colonies prior to enrichment and cells displayed normal markers of pluripotency, differentiation capacity, and karyotype as expected.",

            "text": "Conclusion: UC cells, isolated from thawed UC tissue, can be utilized to generate iPSCs and are amenable to semi or fully automated reprogramming methods. Donor variability and method dependent reprogramming efficiency highlight the importance of method optimization that may be cell population specific. Such efforts will be important in consideration of greater utilization of automated, high-throughput technologies for reprogramming and iPSC line propagation as well as increasing interest in alternative, noninvasive starting material from neonatal tissues. Results/Finding: From 2014 to 2017, 54 CART products were studied on 2 clinical protocols (Anti-BCMA: n=26, Anti-CD19: n=28). Mean CART dose was 4.7x10 6 (\u00b13.4) cells/kg. DGS resulted in significant depletion of RBC (75.3%, p<0.001), platelets (85.4%, p<0.001) and neutrophils (59.8%, p=0.002) and a significant enrichment of monocytes (55.8%, p<0.001) relative to lymphocytes (27.3%, p=0.48) prior to CART culture initiation. Results were similar in both protocols. In univariate analyses, neutrophil depletion efficiency following DGS, was positively correlated with the final CART transduction efficiency (TE) (r=0.6, p=0.002). The lymphocyte fraction (%) in the post-DGS sample was correlated with higher CD8% (r=0.6, p<0.001). Conversely, a greater monocyte proportion (%) in the post-DGS sample correlated with a higher CD4:CD8 ratio (r=0.7, p<0.001). In a Box-Cox transformed mixed effects model comprising of post-DGS RBC, platelet, and neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte counts, RBC counts and platelet counts were strong negative and positive predictors of TE in the final product, respectively (pseudo-r 2 =0.5; p<0.001). Neutrophils and monocytes had a minimal negative impact on TE. The cell composition post-DGS did not affect CD3 + cell FE. Conclusion: DGS depletes RBC, platelets and neutrophils, while enriching monocytes significantly more than lymphocytes in the starting material for CART culture. TE is significantly improved with neutrophil depletion efficiency. Interestingly, a higher RBC count in post-DGS samples worsened TE, whereas platelets had the opposite effect. In this regard, RBC depletion methods may be studied further. Monocytes increased the CD4:CD8 ratio with possible impact on final CART product characteristics. Further analysis of the overall combined effect of DGS on final CART critical characteristics is underway. of the unit to be used in the setting of single unit transplant becomes of paramount importance. UCB units are typically selected based on the HLA match and nucleated cell dose. Additional testing is performed upon thaw prior to infusion and includes: total nucleated cell (TNC) count, viability, CD34 + cell enumeration, sterility, and CFU assay. While the CFU assay is the only in vitro assay that assesses the biological function of HPCs, few studies have documented the influence of the post-thaw CFU dose on engraftment after UCB transplantation. Study Design/Method: In an attempt to investigate the potential impact of post-thaw CFU-GM counts on the quality and efficacy of UCB, we retrospectively studied the transplant outcome in 269 patients with malignant and non-malignant disease, receiving single UCB transplant. To evaluate the independent effect of cell counts, we used Fine and Gray regression to model the endpoints of platelet and neutrophil engraftment. We also correlated the post-thaw CFU-GM counts of 1912 units with the pre-freeze and post-thaw graft characteristics, hoping to optimize selection criteria of UCB. Data analysis included: total nucleated cells, viability, CD34 + cell content, nucleated red blood cells, post-thaw hematocrit, frozen storage time, and UCB bank. Results/Finding: Infused CFU-GM dose was high at 6 x10 4 / kg. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment for the patients undergoing single UCB unit transplant was 96.2% and 89.3%, respectively. We demonstrated an association between post-thaw CFU-GM dose and the speed of neutrophil and platelet engraftment in both myeloablative malignant and non-malignant patients. Post-thaw CD34 + cell dose and CFU-GM dose were highly correlated with each other (r=0.78). However, we observed an interaction in which CFU-GM showed additional benefit on top of patients receiving the lowest quartile of CD34 + cell dose (2.4% increased risk of platelet engraftment for every one unit increase in CFU-GM, P < 0.01 and a 2.0% increase risk of neutrophil engraftment for every one unit increase in CFU-GM, P=0.01). CD34 + cell dose and CFU-GM dose were included in models after controlling for HLA disparity, type of disease and conditioning intensity. HLA disparity did not adversely impact either platelet or neutrophil engraftment (P>0.45). Evaluation of 1912 UCB units showed that despite potential CD34 + standardization issues (i.e., prefreeze testing at bank, then post-thaw testing at transplant center), postthaw CFU-GM/million showed moderate correlation with CD34 + measured both pre-freeze (r=0.35) and post-thaw (r=0.46). Other parameters showed weak correlation with the post thaw CFU-GM/million. Post-thaw CFU-GM was not influenced by storage time (r=-0.04) but was impacted by the UCB bank (P<0.01). Conclusion: CFU-GM measured at our facility at the time of unit thaw seems to provide an effective measure of the quality and efficacy of UCB when the CD34 + cell counts are low. Our analysis suggests that both prefreeze and post-thaw CD 34 + cell enumeration are reflective of unit potency. Thus, CD34 + cell enumeration provided by banks could be considered as an additional selection criterion, particularly when HLA match and nucleated cell dose are equivalent among available options. Background/Case Studies: Thrombocytopenia or qualitative platelet disorder require life-saving platelet transfusions. However, platelet transfusions are limited by alloimmunization, donor-dependent supply, and cost. Increasing efforts focusing on stem cell derived in vitro platelet production have failed to generate platelets in scales required for platelet transfusion. Hence, our aim was to understand the basic molecular aspects of megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis that will enable greater yields of megakaryocytes (MKs) and platelets in vitro. Study Design/Method: CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and grown in serum free stem cell media supplemented with stem cell factor and thrombopoietin for 13 days that favors MK growth. Sub-populations of these cultures were studied for MK markers, apoptosis, signaling and proplatelet formation. RNA sequencing analysis of cultured MKs identified BCL2L2 (encoding Bcl-w) as a candidate apoptosis regulator, and BCL2L2 was significantly correlated with platelet count in 154 healthy individuals (R=0.27, FDR-adjusted P=0.04). Overexpression of BCL2L2 in cultured MKs was achieved by lentiviral transduction and in vitro platelet production was studied. Results/Finding: During MK cultures, three distinct cell populations, namely P1, P2 and P3, were observed by flow cytometry, defined by forward and side scatter. On day 13, only P1 cells showed increased CD41a/ CD42b MK markers (P=6.54E-07 for P1 vs. P2; P=5.17E-05 for P1 vs. P3; n=6), \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation in response to platelet agonists (P=0.03 for PAR4-AP; P=0.04 for thrombin; P=0.03 for collagen related peptide; n=4), and morphologic characteristics similar to mature MKs. P2 cells showed features of apoptosis (P=0.002 for Annexin V + ; n=4) and P3 cells showed similarities to normal human platelets. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2L2 in cultured MKs increased functional P1 MKs by 22.8% (P=0.049; n=5). Most importantly, MK proplatelet formation was increased by 58% (P=0.006; n=5), ultimately resulting in an increased CD41 + platelets (P=0.017; n=6). These in vitro platelets were functional, as demonstrated by thrombin-induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation (P=0.028; n=5) and \u03b1-granule release (P=0.05; n=5). Overall, results showed that BCL2L2 restrains apoptosis in cultured MKs, promotes proplatelet formation and cultured platelet activation, and is associated with human platelet number. Conclusion: BCL2L2 is a novel target for improving MK and platelet yields in culture systems and enforced expression of BCL2L2 may facilitate in vitro MK and platelet production. Background/Case Studies: Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are a highly transfused population. Estimated transfusion rates remain poorly characterized in this population. Rates of blood product utilization may inform the design of transfusion studies and provide data for individualized discussions with parents on the probability of their VLBW infant receiving a blood transfusion. Study Design/Method: Secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study from 2010-2014. Infants with a birth weight \u22641500 g who were not transfused before admission were included and followed until 90 days, discharge, or death. All blood products transfused, including timing, were prospectively recorded. Blood product utilization rates, along with 95% confidence intervals, were estimated for transfusions of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PLT) and cryoprecipitate (CRYO) per 100 hospital days. Birth weight and GA specific estimates were calculated and relative transfusion rates compared using incidence rate ratios.",

            "text": "Results/Finding: Among a study cohort of 598 VLBW infants, 2223 blood product transfusions were recorded during 37,369 infant days of follow-up. Any blood transfusion occurred in 58% of infants, with RBC in 55% (rate: 4.4; 95% CI 4.2-4.6), PLT in 18% (rate 1.1; 1.0-1.2), FFP in 9% (0.4; 0.3-0.5), and CRYO in 1% (0.02; 0.01-0.04). Among birth weight strata, any blood transfusion occurred in 98% of infants < 750 g (rate 13.5; 12.7-14. 3), 73% between 750 to < 1000 g (rate 5.9; 5.5-6.3) and 34% for infants 1000-1500 g (rate 1.8; 1.6-2.1). RBC transfusion rates decreased with increasing GA (Table) . Rates at 23 wk GA were 13 fold higher (95% CI 9. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] than for infants at >30 wk GA. We observed similar trends for PLT, but not FFP or CRYO. Conclusion: Among VLBW infants, blood product utilization of RBC and PLT, but not FFP and CRYO, decrease with increasing GA. GA-specific transfusion rates may inform discussions with families and guide the need for early and proactive consent. These data may also help inform the design of future studies examining blood product transfusion in VLBW infants. Background/Case Studies: Septic transfusion reactions (STR) are a significant risk of blood product transfusions. Pediatric patients are heavily transfused and suffer a higher rate of acute transfusion reactions (ATR) compared to adult patients (6.2 versus 2.1 per 1000 transfusions, respectively). There is not a uniform approach to detect contaminated blood products using product culture following an ATR in pediatric and neonatal patients. The goal of this project was to develop improved criteria for detection of STR by culture of residual product in neonatal and pediatric patients. Study Design/Method: We collected retrospective data for all transfusion reactions that occurred in neonatal and pediatric patients (</ = 15 years of age) which resulted in culture of the residual product during calendar year 2016. We also collected the same data for any reactions with positive residual product culture results from 2012-2015, to enrich the dataset for positive results. Using current AABB criteria for culturing a blood component following an ATR as a reference point, clinical parameters and culture results were compared to determine if modified criteria, including the use of agespecific objective definitions for hypotension and tachycardia, would increase sensitivity for detection of positive residual product cultures (Table) . Results/Finding: 15 institutions submitted complete reaction data for 201 cultured residual components in pediatric and neonatal patients. Of these, 13 had positive culture results (7 platelet and 6 RBC products). Two were considered definite STR (patient cultures grew the same organism); 11 were considered possible STR (patient culture was negative, discordant, or the patient was not cultured).The sensitivity of the AABB criteria to detect any positive culture (definite + possible) was 23% (95% CI 6 -54%); specificity was 66% (95% CI 59 -73% Background/Case Studies: Non-infectious adverse events to transfusion are well reported in adult recipients. However, the literature is scarce for pediatric recipients. The primary objective was to compare the rates of various adverse transfusion reactions (ATRs) reported to the Quebec Hemovigilance System (QHS) among < 18 and \u2265 18 years age recipients (children versus adults). Study Design/Method: ATRs were investigated and reported by transfusion safety officers located in designated hospitals in Quebec. Standard definitions for ATRs were used. Data were validated by the hospital blood bank hematologist, a provincial TSO, a medical epidemiologist and a consultant hematologist. Rate comparisons were made using data from four pediatric hospitals that reported 91% of ATRs among children. Actual number of units transfused by hospitals was used for rate calculations. Results/Finding: From 2005 to 2015, 3 629 868 blood components were transfused in all Quebec hospitals including 4.7% transfused to children. A total of 18 912 ATRs deemed possibly, probably or definitely associated with transfusion were reported. Of those, 1580 (8.4%) occurred among children. ATRs in infants < 1 year old represented 11% of all ATRs among children. Rates of ATRs for all labile product units transfused are described in table 1. Pediatric recipients were more likely to have experienced febrile, allergic and acute hemolytic reactions whereas adult recipients were more likely to have presented circulatory overload. Incidence of fatal ATRS was similar in both groups (0.1 and 0.2%). Rates of ATRs in children were higher with apheresis platelets (1:86) followed by red blood cells (1:109) .",

Whether this is due to physiologic differences or better reporting remains to be determined. Background/Case Studies: Despite the introduction of leukodepleted blood components, it has been shown that donor leukocyte engraftment (microchimerism) remains a long-term consequence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in some patient groups. The incidence of transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM) may be affected by international differences in blood processing methods, transfusion practices or patient types. In Australia, it was found that there was a 10% incidence of transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM) in trauma patients. However, the incidence of TAM has not been extensively studied outside of the trauma setting. This study was conducted to determine the incidence of TAM in Australian pediatric recipients of RBC units. Study Design/Method: Pediatric patients in this study were defined as patients up to 16 years of age at the time of admission. Patients (n = 232) transfused with at least one red blood cell (RBC) unit between 2001 and 2012, were approached for participation in this study. The incidence of TAM was determined using PCR analysis with a panel of insertion/deletion (InDel) biallelic polymorphisms. Results/Finding: Samples were returned from 32 of the potential participants. These were mostly hematology/oncology patients diagnosed with bone marrow failure usually as a result of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Metabolomics approaches can be used to assess the impact of these factors on the phenotypes of stored packed red blood cells (pRBC). Study Design/Method: The multi center RBC-Omics Study enrolled 13,603 whole blood donors from four different US blood centers. Based on 3 endof-storage (42 day) RBC hemolysis measures (spontaneous, osmotic stress, oxidative stress), selected donors at each end of the hemolysis spectrum for each measure were recalled to donate a second unit of leukocyte-filtered pRBCs. Study samples drawn from the pRBC units at 10, 23 and 42 days were snap frozen and later processed for Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (Vanquish -Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher). Feature to compound assignments were performed via Compound Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher) on the basis of high-resolution accurate intact mass, isotopic patterns, retention times against an in house standard library of >1,000 pure chemical compounds, stable isotope-labeled internal standards (including previously established markers of the metabolic age of pRBC) and MS/MS validation of transition fingerprints. Results/Finding: Untargeted metabolomics analyses included 599 samples from 250 donors. There were strong impacts of pRBC storage duration (14.2% of variance) and blood center of collection (12.2% of variance) on metabolic phenotypes. The latter difference was attributable to the additive solutions (AS) used at the different sites (AS-1 vs AS-3; area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve = 1.0). Of note, minimum variance was observed across the 3 blood centers using AS-3, suggesting an overall consistency in standardization of blood processing protocols. The metabolic phenotypes of samples stored in different AS differed beyond the components of the additive formulations; e.g., samples stored in mannitol-free/citrate loaded AS-3 were characterized by higher levels of high-energy compounds, increased glycolytic rates (higher ATP and DPG) and total glutathione levelsall factors significantly correlating with RBC propensity to hemolyze when challenged with pro-oxidant agents such as 2,2-azobis-2methyl-propanimidamide dihydrochloride. Increased methionine metabolism and activation of the trans-sulfuration pathway was noted in samples processed at the site that used AS-1. Conclusion: This study highlights the impact of storage additives on the metabolic heterogeneity and hemolytic phenotypes of samples processed in the largest multi-center RBC metabolomics study conducted to date, an observation that may contribute to explaining the difference in results between small-scale single-center laboratory studies and clinical trials on the age of blood.",

            "text": "Metrics Associated with Expansion of 7-Day Platelets from a Pediatric Transfusion Service to a Hospital System Alex Ryder* and Dawn Moreau. Le Bonheur Children's Hospital Background/Case Studies: Due to their short 5-day shelf-life and required bacterial culture release testing, platelets present a significant inventory management challenge. With the recent FDA clearance of a rapid testing platform for bacterial contamination as a \"safety measure,\" hospital transfusion services now may extend platelet shelf-life to 7-days under many circumstances. Our Pediatric Transfusion Service recently implemented this testing platform, and soon thereafter extended our testing to include day-6 and day-7 platelet units from two Adult Hospital Transfusion Services within our hospital network. Here, we describe metrics associated with these implementations. Study Design/Method: Pre-implementation data was gathered over a 9month period, for platelets received into inventory at our Pediatric Transfusion Service, as well as two affiliated Adult Transfusion Services, from January 1, 2017 through September 30, 2017. Descriptive statistics regarding platelet transfusions and expiration were compared to the 6-month postimplementation period, from October 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018 for our Pediatric Transfusion Service, and a 3-month post-implementation period of January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2018 for our affiliated Adult Transfusion Services. Platelets products consist entirely of single-donor apheresis units. Units are considered expired if they reach outdate prior to being transfused or used for aliquot preparation. Results/Finding: During the 9-month pre-implementation period, our Pediatric Transfusion Service received 344 apheresis platelet units, of which 101 expired prior to use (29.4%). During the 9-month pre-implementation period, the two combined Adult Transfusion Services received 4358 apheresis platelet units, of which 285 expired prior to use (6.5%). During the 6-month post-implementation period, our Pediatric Transfusion Service received 258 apheresis platelet units, of which 23 units expired prior to use (8.9%). During the post-implementation period, 51 platelet units were PGD tested; 21 units tested once, and 30 units tested twice, for a total of 81 tests. We estimate having spent $2430 on testing ($30/test). Of the 51 tested units, 30 were used for transfusion, representing approximately $15,000 in savings ($500/unit). Additionally, the 21 outdated PGD-tested units provided an additional 41 days of platelet stock. We estimate that this amounts to an additional $7590 in cost avoidance, as replacement units were not purchased. During the 3-month period during which testing was extended to platelets for the affiliated Adult Transfusion Services, 1162 units were transfused. Of these, 81 were day-6 or day-7. The total number of expired units was 47 (3.9%), which represents a significant decrease from the pre-implementation period. Savings from transfusion of day-6 and day-7 extended platelets during this short period of time is estimated to be $40,500 ($500/unit). Conclusion: We describe the recent implementation of an FDA-cleared rapid bacterial test for platelets as a \"safety measure\" to achieve a 7-day outdate at a Pediatric Transfusion Service, and the subsequent extension of this practice to positively impact inventory management at two associated Adult Transfusion Services. As we continue to improve the logistics of the process, we believe this testing will continue to decrease platelet wastage, while increasing platelet availability and patient safety.",

Following 1-2 hours rest, platelets were placed on the agitator and either maintained in the original storage container or transferred to the other manufacturer's storage container and placed on the agitator. On days 1, 5 and 7, units were assayed for in vitro testing including platelet count, pH, blood gases, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, extent of shape change (ESC), hypotonic shock response, aggregation to ADP + collagen, glucose, lactate, bicarbonate, morphology, CD42b, CD62P, and annexin V binding. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test; a ANOVA p value of 0.001 was considered significant due to repeated measures.

            "text": "Utilizing Thromboelastography (TEG) as a Bleeding Risk Assessment Tool Prior to Interventional Radiology Procedures Christine Cahill* 1 , Ashwani Sharma 1 , Neil Blumberg 1 , Amy E. Schmidt 1 and Majed A. Refaai 2 . 1 University of Rochester, 2 Transfusion Medicine, University of Rochester Background/Case Studies: The international normalized ratio (INR) is commonly used as a bleeding risk assessment prior to invasive procedures. This practice may be sub optimal as INR was developed to monitor warfarin therapy and is primarily affected by factor VII activity. Several society guidelines recommend correcting INR to \u22641.5 prior to procedures to mitigate bleeding risks,which is not evidence based. Plasma transfusion or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) with and without vitamin K administration are usually used for this purpose. TEG is a whole blood assay which measures the full spectrum of primary and secondary hemostasis and may be a superior tool for risk assessment. Study Design/Method: Records of 14 patients undergoing interventional radiology procedures were collected over a 5-month period and retrospectively reviewed. All patients had TEG in addition to the traditional laboratory screening assays run prior to their procedures. Patient characteristics, medical conditions, laboratory results, and adverse events were collected and analyzed (Table) . Results/Finding: Average age of our cohort was 70 \u00b1 12.2 years with the most common diagnosis being pulmonary disorders (7/14), coronary artery disease (5/14), and/or renal failure (5/14). The interventional radiology procedures performed were biopsies (5/14), central line and catheter placement (5/14), thoracentesis (3/14) and drain placement (1/14) . Pre-procedure renal and liver chemistry profiles showed 4/14 had mild to moderate liver abnormalities and 3/14 had renal failure. Nine patients were on warfarin, 1 patient was on a direct oral anticoagulant (apixiban), and 2 patients were on aspirin. Although the pre-procedure INRs were > 1.5, with an average of 2.3 \u00b1 0.9, TEG results were largely normal suggesting a low risk of bleeding (Table) . No bleeding complications, blood product transfusions, or vitamin K administration were given. Conclusion: In this pilot study TEG appears to be a superior assay to assess bleeding risks in patients undergoing invasive interventional radiology procedures, particularly for patients receiving oral anti-coagulation. Although the INRs were higher than suggested guidelines no patients had significant bleeding or complications. Further studies using a larger cohort are warranted to evaluate for consistent trends. Background/Case Studies: Very few data exist to guide the dosing platelets PLTs for oncology outpatients. At our center, specialized coordinators assign PLTs to oncology patients, and recommend either one or two single donor apheresis PLTs for transfusion based on each pts medical and transfusion history (e.g., ABO type, HLA antibody status, splenomegaly, body mass, response to previous transfusions), as well as PLT attributes (ABO type, PLT yield, volume). In this study, we sought to determine whether the transfusion of one versus two units of apheresis PLTs t had an effect on post-transfusion PLT count, time to next transfusion, or the PLT count prior to the next PLT transfusion. Study Design/Method: After obtaining IRB approval, we retrospectively studied all adult oncology pts who received an outpatient transfusion from 7/1/2016 through 11/7/2017. We collected the date and time of transfusion, unit number, and date and time of pre-and post-transfusion PLT counts. Results/Finding: A total of 605 pts received 8,491 PLT transfusions cumulatively during the study period. The majority of pts (n=363, 60%) were variably transfused with 1 or 2 PLTs per outpatient visit while a minority were transfused exclusively with a 1 PLT-only (17.2%) or 2 PLTonly (22.6%) strategy throughout the study period. The vast majority (n=7809, 92%) of PLTs were given to patients who received a mixture of 1-PLT and 2-PLT transfusions during the study period. As summarized in Table 1 , the pre-and post-transfusion PLT counts and interval between outpatient visits were medically similar (although statistically different) regardless of transfusion strategy. Additionally, pts who received 2 PLTs probes for 90 blood group antigens  across 19 blood group genes (ABO, GYPA, GYPB, GYPE, RHD, RHCE,  KEL, DARC, SLC14A1, SLC4A1, ACHE, ERMAP, ART4, AQP1, ICAM4,  CD55, CR1, CD44, BSG) . After capture, samples were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq. Ninety five samples from blood donors previously test by licensed SNP assay were used for comparison testing and selected to represent a diverse set of antigen phenotypes. We used bloodTyper, an automated blood group typing software platform for interpretation of NGS data (Lane WJ, et al, Lancet Haematology, 2018 -In Press) . bloodTyper was enhanced to analyze the MIP based NGS data. The MIP based NGS results were compared to serologic and SNP typing for 36 antigens (A, B ERMAP and CR1 failed quality filters repeatedly; careful review revealed that they were not captured in the ES library. Serologic validation for K, Fy a , Fy b , Jk a , and Jk b was performed on RBC samples from 103 participants and resulted in 3 discrepancies: 1 due to clerical error, and 2 attributed to failure of the antibody to detect expression of a weak Kidd allele. Ten novel frameshift or nonsense variants were identified in the A4GALT, BCAM, SLC14A1, SLC4A1, ICAM4, CR1, GCNT2, and ABCB6 genes and predicted to be deleterious for enzymatic function or antigen expression.",

Our results corroborate the relative high frequency of weak Kidd alleles in the Caucasian population. CLIA-certified serology of 5 antigens in 103 samples correlated with NGS predictions, but the latter was more precise for detection of weak Kidd expression. One percent of participants carried novel blood group variants predicted to be deleterious through a nonsense or frameshift mechanism, which are currently under investigation. Background/Case Studies: Unravelling the genetic bases of blood groups has facilitated implementation of novel diagnostic tools in transfusion medicine and related fields. By now, all systems except one have been resolved to allow genotypic antigen prediction. The Xg a antigen was reported in 1962 and PBDX (now XG) was identified as the underlying gene in 1994. However, the reason why 33% of men and 10% of women lack Xg a has remained undefined. A hypothetical regulatory locus, XGR, was proposed already in 1987 to govern expression of both antigens in the XG system, Xg a (encoded by XG) and high-frequency antigen CD99 (encoded by neighbour gene MIC2/CD99). XG is located in the pseudo-autosomal region 1 on both sex chromosomes but is disrupted on Y and only produces a protein (of unknown function!) from X. We hypothesized that Xg a /CD99 expression is transcriptionally controlled by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the XG region. Study Design/Method: Calculated Xg a allele frequencies in different populations were compiled from the literature. Comparisons were made with multiple XG variants in the 1000 Genomes Project. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the same region were analyzed at https://gtexportal.org. Transcription factor binding was analyzed at http://jaspar.genereg.net. Blood samples from 158 blood donors anonymized other than for gender were phenotyped for Xg a and genotyped. Flow cytometric typing of Xg a and CD99 was performed on a subset of donors and mRNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a luciferase reporter assay assessed the functional importance of the identified SNP. Results/Finding: Among > 2,600 investigated XG variants, rs311103 showed the best fit to Xg a frequencies in historical datasets. Strikingly, the same SNP, located 3.7 kb upstream of the XG transcription start site, was also the eQTL with the most significant impact on XG-mRNA levels in whole blood (p=2.0 \u00d7 10 -22 ). Also, rs311103C abolishes a GATA1-binding site, which was corroborated by clear ChIP seq peaks in datasets from erythropoietic cells. Genotyping showed that all 120 Xg(a+) donors, regardless of gender, carried at least one rs311103G allele. One female sample was positive by flow cytometry only. All 13 Xg(a\u2212) women and 13 Xg(a\u2212) men were homozygous for rs311103C. In 11 Xg(a\u2212) men, C was accompanied by a G, presumably Y-derived. As opposed to Xg(a+) donors, Xg(a\u2212) showed low-to-undetectable XG-mRNA levels. GATA1 binding to oligonucleotide probes with rs311103G but not C was shown by EMSA and confirmed by mass spectrometry following protein-oligonucleotide pulldown experiments. The intact GATA1 motif enhanced transcription in the luciferase reporter assay. Finally, CD99 expression on RBCs also correlated to rs311103 status (GG>GC>CC).",

Xg(a\u2212) is due to impaired transcription, which follows Background/Case Studies: A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with metastatic ovarian carcinoma, and no history of pregnancy or transfusion, typed as serologic weak D (weakly positive by gel and non-reactive by tube), so her sample was reflexed for RHD genotyping which revealed the patient was RHD*weak D type 1. Thereafter, she was managed as D + as recommended by AABB/CAP workgroup guidelines, as individuals with weak D type 1 are not considered at risk for production of clinically significant anti-D. She received 7 D + RBCs over 21 days for chemotherapy induced anemia and unexplained hemolysis while undergoing carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy. Four weeks after her last D + transfusion, she presented with worsening anemia and anti-D in her plasma. Study Design/Method: The plasma anti-D was investigated to determine if allo-or auto-anti-D. Serologic testing was by standard methods. RHAG, RHD, and RHCE -cDNA amplification and sequencing were performed to determine if mutations in other Rh proteins part of the Rh membrane complex, in combination with the c.809T>G (p. Val270Gly) associated with weak D type 1, could potentially explain alloimmunization. Results/Finding: The pre-transfusion RBC phenotype was C+c+E\u2212e+; antibody screen and DAT were negative. Four weeks after transfusion of D + units, she presented with worsening anemia (Hgb=6.8 g/dL), slight increase in bilirubin and clinical concern for hemolysis. The DAT was negative but anti-D was present in plasma (2 + to 3 + by PEG IAT) and in an eluate. No antibodies to carboplatin or paclitaxel were detected. Reference laboratory testing suggested allo-anti-D: plasma adsorbed with rr RBCs contained anti-D. Anti-LW was ruled out. The anti-D reacted with D variant RBCs (DIII, DIV, DV, DVI, DVII, R Har 0 ), but did not react with weak D type 1 RBCs (n=3). Testing of the patient's RBCs with the ALBA Advanced Partial D Typing Kit gave a pattern of reactivity consistent with a weak D type 1 sample tested in parallel. Sequencing of RHD, RHCE, and RHAG found no additional changes. Samples obtained 2 and 8 months later showed anti-D and anti-D + anti-K, respectively. Lookback indicated at least 2 of 7 D + units were also K+. Samples tested 9.5 months after the last transfusion of D + units continued to show anti-D, although reacting weaker than prior (1 + in contrast to 2 + to 3+). The reactivity was equivalent, as shown by titration, in her plasma adsorbed with autologous RBCs. Conclusion: We report robust production of allo-anti-D in a patient with weak D type 1. Weak D type 1 individuals are not considered to be at risk for allo-anti-D based on observational studies primarily from Europe. There are rare exceptions known, but to date these anti-D have not been associated with clinically significant RBC destruction. This patient's anti-D may have contributed to exacerbation of her anemia, however confounding clinical history and abnormal pre-transfusion lab values makes a definitive assessment challenging. Transfusion of at least 2 D+K + units and sensitization to both antigens suggests they may have acted synergistically to complement alloimmunization. Background/Case Studies: Human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) includes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Each IgG subtype contains different isoallotypes due to genetic variation, with IgG3 containing the most isoallotypes (N=15) described. It was previously shown that an FDA-approved monoclonal anti-IgG failed to recognize 2 of 15 hIgG3 anti-Kell (K) isoallotypes (hIgG3-03 and hIgG3-13) by indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). The failure to detect these two anti-K antibodies was due to amino acid changes in the isotype heavy chain. Anti-K is the second most common cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and the observation raised concerns of the potential clinical impact of these two isoallotypes. We wanted to examine whether any of these hIgG3 isoallotypes had a differential effect on human monocyte/macrophage Fc\u03b3 receptor-mediated phagocytosis. We compared the phagocytic activity of 15 purified recombinant hIgG3 anti-K isoallotypes using an opsonized-erythrocyte monocyte monolayer assay (MMA). Study Design/Method: A novel monoclonal recombinant anti-K antibody was isolated and used to create a panel of the 15 hIgG3 isoallotypes. Thus, all monoclonal antibodies had the identical variable region genes and recognized the same K antigen epitope, differing only in their Fc\u03b3 heavy chain region. The hIgG3 anti-K antibodies were pre-incubated with K-positive (KK, Kk) red blood cells (RBCs). Opsonized RBCs were examined using IAT (tube and gel), flow cytometry (using anti-lambda chain antibody to avoid any variations in Fc heavy chain region), and MMA. Results/Finding: A dosage effect was seen for many of the hIgG3 isoallotypes where the Kk IAT result (2 + to 3+) was lower than KK (3 + to 4+), particularly for hIgG3-03 and hIgG3-13. Opsonisation of KK RBCs was optimal at 2.5 \u03bcg/mL hIgG3, as determined by flow cytometry analysis. There was a differential effect of the 15 hIgG3 isoallotypes on the induction of phagocytosis. Compared to hIgG3-01 (Phagocytic index, PI=16), hIgG3-03, hIgG3-08, and hIgG3-13 showed a reduced capacity to induce phagocytosis with PI of 9.5, 8.0, and 8.5 respectively. However, hIgG3-17 (PI=27), hIgG3-18 (PI=31), and hIgG3-19 (PI=34) showed significantly enhanced ability to induce phagocytosis (p\u22640.1). Both hIgG3-18 and hIgG3-19 induced clinically significant phagocytosis at 500ng/mL, while hIgG3-03, 08, and 13 required a 10-fold increase in concentration to achieve a PI suggesting clinical significance. Conclusion: Certain amino acid variations in the Fc region of hIgG3 antibodies may lead to an enhanced or reduced capacity for their ability to induce phagocytosis. Results indicate that all anti-K hIgG3 isoallotypes can be clinically significant as measured by MMA. Thus, antiglobulin reagents that fail to detect hIgG3-03 or hIgG3-13 could present a problem.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The Lutheran blood group system consists of 24 antigens located on the basal-cell adhesion glycoprotein called B-CAM, with 19 high-prevalence, 4 equilibrated and one low-prevalence antigen reported to date. This protein is strongly involved in the interaction of the red blood cells (RBCs) with the extracellular matrix. The aim of the present work was to describe a novel high-prevalence antigen of the Lutheran system, through the investigation of two sisters who both produced the corresponding anti-LU antibody. Study Design/Method: Blood samples of a pregnant woman were firstly referred to our laboratory for investigation of a pan-agglutinating antibody. Antibody identification (gel-test IAT, Bio-Rad) was performed on native, papain-treated (Diagast) and trypsin-treated (Sigma) RBCs. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells by a fully automated method and amplified by LU exon-specific primers and sequenced. Results/Finding: The proband was a group A, R 2 r, K-, 47 yo female patient, of Turkish origin. During her first pregnancy, in 2003, her serum was reactive on all native RBCs but nonreactive on trypsin-treated RBCs and LU null samples. Autologous controls were negative and her LU phenotype was unambiguously LU:-1,2. Underlying alloantibodies of common specificities were ruled out. The antibody was finally concluded as a so-called \"para-LU antibody\", i.e. an antibody to a probable high-prevalence LU antigen of unknown specificity. The proband had another child two years later without any complication despite a stronger reactivity of the antibody. In 2003, blood samples from siblings were required for compatibility testing and RBC antibody screening; her elder sister turned out to be compatible. However, no further investigation was performed at that time. In 2008, a \"para-LU antibody\" was also detected in the proband's elder sister during pregnancy. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed the presence, in both sisters, of two nucleotide changes at homozygous state in the LU-BCAM gene, on a LU*02 allele basis. The first one is a synonymous change in exon 3, c.324G>A (p.Gly108Gly, rs3745159) known to be present in about 3-4% of the general population. The second one was found in exon 9, c.1184G>A (rs200421757), and is responsible for the amino acid change p.Arg395His. This mutation has been reported with a frequency of less than 0,03% in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database. Conclusion: Serological and molecular studies allowed us to provide evidence for a novel high-prevalence antigen in the Lutheran blood group system, and most importantly, to identify the specificity of a patient's antibody and recommend optimal transfusion policy. We suggest to provisionally assign the names LU27 and LUYA (after the proband's name) for this antigen. According to the structural model of Parsons et al (Blood, 1997) , the LUYA expression is predicted to be on the fourth IgSF domain of BCAM, as is the LU7 antigen.",

Antibody screening of the patient plasma was negative. We applied various antibodies to the crossmatch-positive relevant blood product but could not identify the antigen. It was named \"SUMI\", after the first proband whose RBCs carried the antigen, SUMI antigen was recognized as an unidentified low-incidence antigen. Here, we report that the SUMI antigen is present on the Glycophorin A (GPA). Study Design/Method: Serological tests were performed by the standard tube method or with automated blood grouping machine (PK7300). Standard methods were also applied for the RBC treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Anti-SUMI monoclonal antibody-producing cell line (HIRO-305) was obtained from lymphocytes of anti-SUMI positive individuals by the hybridoma method. Immune-complex capture fluorescence analysis (ICFA) using Luminex was used to analyze the SUMI antigen. Genomic DNAs were extracted from peripheral white blood cells of SUMI-positive individuals and the nucleotide sequence of GYPA was examined by direct sequencing and TA cloning. Results/Finding: Nine SUMI positives were found by screening 324,000 Japanese blood donors with human monoclonal IgM antibody (HIRO-305). SUMI is sensitive to red cell treatment with trypsin, ficin, pronase, or sialidase, but not \u03b1-chymotrypsin or DTT. Anti-SUMI (1 + or higher) was found 1,351 among 10,392 normal sera by saline tube method at room temperature. The strongest antibody titer was 1:64. On the other hand, 100 cases of umbilical cord blood plasma showed negative reactions with the SUMIpositive RBCs. ICFA assay with murine monoclonal antibodies to intracellular potion of GPA (CBC-450) showed that SUMI antigen is located on the GPA. GYPA gene analysis showed a mutation of c.91 A > C (p. Thr 31 Pro). The same mutation was recognized in all SUMI+. All of SUMI + showed that M antigen are positive. Conclusion: The SUMI antigen is a novel low frequency antigen of the MNS blood group system that represent Thr31Pro substitution in GPA. The frequency of SUMI antigen was 0.0028% among the Japanese donors. From family analysis, it was confirmed that SUMI antigen is dominantly inherited. Anti-SUMI was detected in 13.0% of healthy donors, and it was considered to be a naturally occurring antibodies of IgM class. New York Blood Center Background/Case Studies: Algorithms for donor antigen typing and DNA analysis and in-house policies for serologic confirmation when only DNA testing is ordered lead to the discovery of multiple RHCE discordances. We investigated six samples with conflicting results: E in 3 donors; C in 2 donors and 1 OB patient. Study Design/Method: Automated PK7300 and manual tube methods were used for RBC typing. Genomic DNA was isolated from WBCs and RNA from RBCs. HEA PreciseType, RHCE BeadChip, RHCE gene sequencing, and in-house assays were done. RhCE-specific cDNA analysis was performed for two samples. Results/Finding: Three Caucasian donors typed E\u2212 by PK7300 (clones P3x25513G8+MS24) but reflexed HEA testing for extended RBC profiling predicted the RBCs were E+. By tube testing, the RBCs were 1+ w -3 + with Immucor and 3 + -4 + with Bio-Rad anti-E. RHCE BeadChip indicated E + phenotype but review of the genotype results showed the samples were heterozygous for c.697C>G (p.Gln233Glu). Gene sequencing with SNP-specific primers confirmed the presence of c.697G on RHCE*cE. A Caucasian and a Hispanic donor were C + by PK7300 (clone 906) but predicted C\u2212 by HEA. By tube testing, the samples were 3+ s with Immucor Gamma-Clone, Ortho BioClone, and Bio-Rad Seraclone anti-C. By multiplex PCR and RHCE BeadChip, the samples lacked the 109bp insert in intron 2 characteristic of RH*C. RHCE exon 2 sequencing however was consistent with RH*C. Rh-cDNA analysis found a conventional RhCe transcript, indicating this is a novel allele encoding a C + phenotype that lacks the 109bp insert. A Hispanic OB patient with anti-e and the paternal sample were referred for RHCE genotyping to evaluate risk for HDFN. The paternal sample was genotyped as C+E\u2212c+e + (consistent with serology) and all children predicted to be e+. The patient's RBCs were predicted C\u2212E+c+e\u2212 by HEA. Serology confirmed E+c+e\u2212, but her RBCs were C+ w with Immucor Gamma-Clone, Ortho BioClone and 2 single donor source anti-C, and 2 + to 3 + with ALBAclone, Bio-Rad Seraclone, and 1 single donor source anti-C. RHCE BeadChip indicated C\u2212 phenotype, but the genotype indicated heterozygosity for c.48G/C and c.307C/T. Rh-cDNA analysis showed the changes were on RHCE*cE, indicating expression of C antigen from a novel allele, RHCE*cE48C, 307T. Conclusion: We report three new RHCE alleles; RHCE*cE697G associated with variable E antigen typing (n=3), RHCE*Ce lacking the classic intron insertion associated with C antigen (n=2), and RHCE*cE48C 307T encoding variable C antigen expression (n=1). The c.697G has been reported on two RHCE alleles but with additional changes (RHCE*cE697G, 712G; RHCE*cE697G, 712G, 733G, 744C); both with variable E expression. Interestingly, the RHCE*cE697G was found in three Midwest Caucasian donors. Continuous discovery of RH variants, knowledge of the serology, prevalence of the alleles and their potential clinical impact are important for designing future genotyping assays.",

The RhD protein expresses the D antigen whereas the RhCE protein carries the C/c and E/e antigens. However, some RHD variants may paradoxically code for a RhCE reactivity, such as RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D and RHD*DIVa-2 responsible for a C reactivity with the MS-24 clone. Conversely, some RHCE alleles, such as RHCE*ceHAR, RHCE*ceCF, RHCE*ceRT and RHCE*ceSL, may express RhD epitopes more or less detectable by anti-D reagents depending on the clone being used. We describe here the serological and molecular investigation of a D-positive patient of Western European descent with anti-D alloimmunization. Study Design/Method: RhD typing was carried out by standard hemagglutination techniques with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Adsorptionelution testing was performed with a polyclonal anti-D and acid elution method. Genomic DNA was amplified by RHD and RHCE-specific primers and sequenced. RHD gene was also investigated with the wRHD DNAbeadchip device (Immucor/BioArray). Results/Finding: Blood samples from a group A, D+ w C-E-c+e+, K-, 76 yo male patient of Spanish origin were referred in March 2012 to our reference laboratory to explore an anti-D with negative DAT and autocontrols. The patient was concluded to carry a weak D phenotype by the referring laboratory and likely considered D + as he was of European ancestry. Anti-D was observed 5 months after the first transfusion of D + RBC units in June 2010. The patient was then regularly transfused with D + platelets and D-RBC units for about 2 years.",

RHD analysis showed no exon amplification. New blood samples were sent after another transfusion episode in 2014. As no RHD gene was found in the patient, we speculated that the D reactivity could originate from a RHCE variant allele. This was confirmed by the presence of a heterozygous c.508A>G non-templated mutation in exon 4 (p.Arg170Gly). Besides, an adsorption-elution study with a polyclonal anti-D was found to be negative. Conclusion: We described a novel RHCE allele, RHCE*ce508G (Genbank number KX236061), that expresses D epitopes detectable by several commonly used monoclonal anti-D reagents. This may cause a false-positive D typing, especially with D7B8, MS-26, HM10 and ESD1 clones (3 to 4 + reactivity), and a risk of anti-D alloimmunization in a seemingly D + patient. This is especially a matter of concern for D typing in women of childbearing age. According to the Rh protein structural model from Flegel WA (Curr Opin Hematol, 2006) , p.Arg170Gly is located in the extracellular domain of the RhCE protein, within the so-called \"Rh protein vestibule\". Our data for this new allele seem to confirm the importance of this vestibule area in terms of RhD epitope expression. We propose to call this new variant RHCE*ceRG (RG for Arg to Gly), similarly to the naming procedure followed for RHCE*ceSL and RHCE*ceRT.",

Westhoff 1 . 1 Immunohematology and Genomics Laboratory, New York Blood Center, 2 New York Blood Center, 3 University of Virginia Health System, 4 Keck School of Medicine at USC, 5 LAC/USC Medical Center Background/Case Studies: The serological and molecular diversity of the RhD antigen is without question and the list of RHD variant alleles continues to grow. We investigated samples from 3 females referred for weaker than expected D typing and RH genotyping. Study Design/Method: Genomic DNA was isolated from WBCs. RHD BeadChip assay and RHD sequencing was performed. RhD-specific cDNA analysis was done for two samples. Serologic testing was by standard methods with multiple anti-D and by ALBAclone Advanced Partial RhD typing kit for two samples. Results/Finding: Sample 1 was from a pregnant woman, ethnicity unknown, whose RBCS typed +w at IS. Her RBCs also reacted 1+ s to 2 + at immediate spin (IS) and 2 + to 3 + at IAT with anti-D Ortho BioClone, Immucor Gamma-clone and Series 4 and Series 5, Quotient anti-D blend, alpha and delta. RBCs also typed C\u2212E\u2212c+e+, V/VS + and G\u2212/G + with monoclonal/polyclonal anti-G. Three clones of the ALBA Partial D kit (LHM174/102, LHM70/45, LHM57/17) were non-reactive with her RBCs but the pattern did not match any indicated partial D. RHD BeadChip showed low signal for exon 2 markers, suggesting a hybrid allele. RHD exon 2 sequencing and RhD-cDNA analysis confirmed a hemizygous RHD-ce(2)-D hybrid with c.254C>G and c.307C>T (associated with C antigen) and a c.744C>T silent change in exon 5. RHCE BeadChip detected RHCE*ce/ce733G. Sample 2 RBCs from a woman of unknown ethnicity sent for RHD genotyping, reacted 1 + to 3 + IS and 3 + IAT with Bio-Rad Seraclone, Immucor Gamma-clone and Ortho-BioClone. RHD BeadChip did not detect any changes, but exon 2 sequencing identified a heterozygous change c.329T>C, associated with partial RHD*DVII. RHD-cDNA analysis confirmed RHD*DVII and identified a RHD-CE(3-9)-D hybrid with an additional change c.733C>G in exon 5. Sample 3 was from an African-American pregnant woman referred for variable D typing. Her RBCs reacted 1 + to 3 + at IS and 3 + to 4 + at IAT with Ortho BioClone, Immucor Gamma-clone and Series 4 and Series 5, Bio-Rad Seraclone and Seraclone blend and typed Go(a+). Her RBCs typed C\u2212E\u2212c+e + and reacted with five clones of the ALBA Partial D kit with a DIV pattern. RHD Bead-Chip detected c.712G>A and c.1048G>C; RHD gene sequencing confirmed a new allele. Conclusion: We report 3 new RHD alleles, two with variable D typing with evidence to encode partial D phenotypes and one silent RH hybrid in trans to DVII. Sample 1 was found to be a new RHD-ce(2)-D hybrid with c.254C>G and c.307C>T in exon 2. These changes are characteristic for RHCE*ceAG.05, suggesting this allele arose by a gene conversion event.",

Otrock. Henry Ford Hospital Background/Case Studies: D negative (D-) patients (pts) are routinely transfused with D-RBCs due to the increased immunogenicity of the D antigen. The rate of alloimmunization to the D antigen following transfusion can be as high as 80%; however, immunosuppressed pts may be less likely to become alloimmunized. Some D-pts undergoing liver transplant may require a large number of RBC units which can risk the inventory of D-RBCs which are considered relatively rare (10-15% of donor units) as compared to D positive (D+) RBCs. So the blood bank may be forced to supply such pts with D + RBCs due to inventory constraints. Though the process of providing D + RBCs to D-transplant recipients is accepted in blood bank practice, the incidence of alloimmunization to the D-antigen in D-liver transplant pts has not been well defined. With a very active liver transplant program at our institution, studying the prevalence of anti-D formation in Dliver transplant pts receiving D + RBCs perioperatively will assist in successful patient blood management. Study Design/Method: This was a retrospective study performed at a single large academic medical center. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Electronic medical records and blood bank files for all 505 pts who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, from August 2012 through December 2017 were reviewed. Results/Finding: Twelve D-pts received D + blood perioperatively. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of these pts. The median age was 60 years (range 48-67 years); 8 (66.7%) were male. Median number of D + RBC units transfused was 13.5 units (range 3-72 units). There was no evidence of D alloimmunization in any patient after a median follow up of 30.9 months (range 20.2-59.6 months). Only one patient died after surgery. We had 8 Dpts (8/76 = 10.5% of all D-liver transplant recipients) who presented with D alloimmunization before transplant; none of these pts was transfused with D + blood at our institution.",

            "text": "Complement Stability in Thawed Plasma: Inventory and Plasmapheresis Implications Laura Stephens*, LinaCel G. Cadden and Samuel Pepkowitz. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Donor plasma is selected over albumin for therapeutic plasmapheresis replacement fluid when non-oncotic functional components such as clotting factors and ADAMTS-13 need repletion. Because plasma also contains complement proteins C3 and C4, which have beneficial functions in immunity and inflammation but may have disease-accentuating roles in conditions such as transplant rejection and complement-mediated glomerular disease, post-procedure complement levels should be of concern for select patients. While coagulation proteins, fibrinogen, and ADAMTS-13 are known to be preserved in Thawed Plasma (TP), the stability of C3 and C4 has not been reported, and multiple reference laboratory stability comments suggest serum complement levels drop after three days of storage. Accordingly, this study assayed C3 and C4 in refrigerated TP and patient serum during 5 days of storage. Study Design/Method: C3 and C4 were measured by an FDA-approved nephelometric method on four units of FP24 donor plasma at the time of thaw and on each of 5 days of storage at 1 to 6\u00b0C C3 and C4 were also measured on three random patient samples stored under the same conditions. Results/Finding: Donor TP unit C3 and C4 levels had an average change in value of -0.3% (range: -13.0% to + 5.9%) over 5 days after thaw (Table 1) . Patient serum samples had initial C3 levels of 69.2, 108.0, and 141.0 mg/dL (reference range: 79-152 mg/dL) and C4 levels of 29.5, 26.6, and 30.4 mg/dL (reference range: 16-38 mg/dL). Serum C3 and C4 levels changed by an average of +3.0% and -0.1%, respectively, over 5 days of refrigeration. Conclusion: C3 and C4 levels are maintained for the shelf-life of TP. For plasmapheresis cases in which maintenance of complement levels postprocedure is indicated, there would be no advantage to use immediately thawed plasma preparations over stored TP. For patients for whom a lowered complement concentration is desired, albumin replacement is preferred when clinically acceptable, and stored TP would provide no benefit over immediately thawed plasma preparations. Serum C3 and C4 levels also appear stable when refrigerated for up to 5 days. This investigation has allowed our tertiary care/trauma center to confidently maintain a rolling inventory of TP, supporting immediate availability for emergency/massive transfusion needs. Additionally, routine use of TP for plasmapheresis fluid replacement has curtailed expiration of our TP product inventory. disorders (e.g. hemophilia A), but today is primarily used to replace Fg in trauma and acquired coagulopathy. Cryo guidelines require use within 6 hrs of thawing, but may be overly restrictive when cryo is used for Fg replacement. We assessed the hemostatic quality of thawed pooled cryo stored at refrigerated (4C) and room temperatures (RT) for 35 days. Study Design/Method: Cryo (6-donor pools, Type O or A, n=4 each) was thawed and distributed into 6 ml aliquots for storage at cold (4\u02daC) or RT (21-24\u02daC). Cryo was diluted 1:10 with PBS and analyzed for Fg and FVIII in a hematology analyzer. vWF activity was quantified by ristocetin cofactor assay. Coagulation of cryo diluted in cryo-poor plasma (CPP) at original ratios (1:10) was measured by ROTEM. Thrombin generation of the cryo-CPP mixture was quantified by thrombogram. Packed red cells, platelet concentrates, frozen plasma, and cryo were combined (1:1:1:1) to simulate massive transfusion and analyzed by ROTEM. vWF function was also measured by shear-induced adhesion of platelets to a collagen-coated surface flow. the recent year (therefore not complying with the current 12 months deferral policy). Only 8.5% self-deferred themselves through the DHQ. Of those who did not donate blood in the last year, 202 (19%) declared they plan to do so under the current 12 months deferral policy, although they had sexual intercourse with another man in the last year, raising the rate of blood donors among the MSM population that participated in the study from 13% to 22%. About 64.5% of the respondents are supportive/ very supportive of the suggested new FPQP, and if introduced, 64% would consider donating blood, which will raise the rate of blood donors among the respondents from 13% to 65%. In addition, 85% of MSM who donated blood in the last year stated they will agree to reveal their sexual orientation in the DHQ, in order to be included in the program, compared to 8.5% under the current 12 months deferral policy. Conclusion: Introduction of new approaches is needed, to increase compliance of the LGBT community, enabling them to take part in life saving by blood donations, without compromising the blood recipients' safety. The suggested Plasma Quarantine Policy will bring probably more MSM to donate blood, who will truly state their sexual practice. This and the retesting the donors in the future donation will significantly increase blood safety, when compared to the current practice. If accepted, the suggested change in policy should be accompanied by an adequate educational campaign for both blood donors and recipients. We hypothesized that, unlike modified human RBCs with multiple background human gene products, mouse RBCs would serve as a \"blank canvas\" without human RBC alloantigens, that could be engineered to express individual human alloantigens. Study Design/Method: Transgenic mice in which RBCs express either K, k, or Jk b alloantigens were subjected to an extended phenotype with antibodies against common human RBC alloantigens. Transgenic or wild-type mouse RBCs were also tested with plasma from two human patients with known identified alloantibodies. Human plasma was incubated with wild-type mouse RBCs, and bound antibodies were eluted and tested for carbohydrate binding with a glycan array containing 600 different carbohydrates of known chemistry. Results/Finding: Mouse RBCs typed negative for RhD, RhC, Rhc, RhE, Rhe, Fy a , Fy b , K, k, S, s, or Jk b antigens but were reactive with anti-Jk a . \"Naturally occurring\" alloantibodies to mouse RBCs, both IgM and IgG, were detected in multiple samples of human plasma. Eluates from mouse wild-type RBCs incubated with human plasma were observed to have a strong IgG signal against only a single carbohydrate of the structure Gal-NAca1-3(Fuca1-2)Galb1-4GlcNAcb1-3Galb1-4GlcNAcb1-3Galb1-4GlcNAcb-; no reactivity was seen with other carbohydrates of a similar structure (e.g. other poly-N-acetyl-lactosamines). Human anti-mouse antibodies were easily absorbed using wild-type RBCs, resulting in plasma free of activity against wild-type RBCs. Testing absorbed plasma on transgenic mouse RBCs (wild-type, K, k or Jk b ) correctly identified an anti-k and anti-Jk b in two separate patient specimens, by flow cytometry and wet-tube testing in the immunohematology lab. Conclusion: These studies report a novel approach to isolate individual human blood group antigens, one at a time, on mouse RBCs. The use of RBCs of a non-human origin provides several advantages, including: 1) a \"blank canvas\" without most human alloantigens, 2) RBCs that can be used in existing immunohematology platforms, and 3) a stable source of RBCs from well-characterized animals. Problems include assessing the basis for reactivity of anti-Jk a with mouse RBCs and eliminating human anti-mouse RBC antibodies. Although absorption works well, identifying the target and eliminating it would be preferable, by genetic modification and/or enzymatic treatment. Ongoing work includes expanding the panel of transgenic lines and understanding background reactivity. . This raises the concern that 16H8 may miss clinically significant alloantibodies in patients whose genome encodes the IgG3-03 and/or IgG3-13 variants. Study Design/Method: Sequence analysis of 29 known human variants of IgG subtypes was carried out. A monoclonal anti-K1 antibody was expressed recombinantly, as each of the different 29 variants, and this panel was used as targets to assess the ability of 16H8 to bind. K+/k + targets were incubated with each expressed anti-K1 variant, followed by 16H8, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, mice were immunized with human IgG, splenocytes were fused with myeloma partners, and novel monoclonal anti-AHG antibodies were cloned and characterized using the same assay. Results/Finding: 7 amino acid residues were identified within the variants analyzed, which were common to canonical IgG1-IgG3 but missing in variants of IgG4. Of these, only a single amino acid (E) at position 419 was also found in the IgG3 variants that 16H8 does not recognize (IgG3-03 and IgG3-13) but was Q for all other expressed IgG1-IgG3 variants. Mutation of the natural E at position 419 to Q in IgG4-01 caused a gain of 16H8 reactivity. Moreover, Q instead of E at position 419 is the only amino acid difference between IgG3-03 (16H8 nonreactive) and IgG3-06 (16H8 reactive). In addition, a new monoclonal antibody was isolated that recognized all expressed variants of IgG1-IgG3, but not variants of IgG4. This new monoclonal AHG mapped to position 355, which is R in all expressed non-IgG4 variants but is a Q in IgG4 variants analyzed.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: A number of blood programs have recognized the opportunity that blood donation provides to identify ostensibly healthy individuals who might be unaware of risks to their health. These programs have included, along with mandated serological testing, such assays as non-fasting total cholesterol (TC) and hemoglobin A1c. They have also taken steps to notify individuals whose results suggest risk for cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Since our program has a long history of providing donors information about their TC, we decided to find out if some individuals with elevated TC met the criteria for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH, which has a prevalence of 1 in 300 to 1 in 500 in the general population is a common, but frequently underdiagnosed, genetic disease. The disease is marked by severe elevation in cholesterol, evidence of coronary arterial disease at an early age and, when untreated, early death due to myocardial infarction. Results/Finding: Over storage time, platelet recoveries declined significantly compared with fresh (all p<0.006) and from 5 to 10 days (p=0.02) and 5 to 15 days (p=0.002). Platelet survivals decreased significantly from fresh to 5 days, 10 days, and 15 days (all p<0.0001). Intrinsic apoptotic events, measured by mitochondrial membrane integrity, decreased only non-significantly over storage time. Similarly, apoptosis measured by activation of the effector caspases 3,7 increased non-significantly from fresh to 15 days. Phosphatidyl serine exposure (measured by Annexin V binding) increased significantly from 5 to 10 days (p=0.03) and from 5 to 15 days (p=0.002). All other markers of platelet activation, specifically microparticles and P-selectin increased significantly from 5 to 15 days (p=0.001, p=0.002 respectively). Of note, platelet response to collagen stimulation revealed functional inside-out signaling with integrin activation comparable to (and non-significantly different to) fresh platelets up to 15 days of storage. The best predictor for 10 day platelet recovery and survival was collagen-stimulated integrin activation (r=0.88, p=0.048 and r=0.89, p=0.043 respectively). Conclusion: We performed the first studies with extended storage cold (4 \u00baC)-plasma-stored apheresis platelets up to 15 days and a fresh comparator. We show that there is continuous loss of recovery up to 15 days of storage. Overall, continuous platelet activation is a hallmark of coldstored platelets, while markers for caspase activation and mitochondrial membrane integrity show a delay of apoptosis during cold-storage. Platelet function tests show preserved integrin activation comparable to fresh up to 15 days of storage. The best predictor for 10 day platelet recovery and survival was collagen-stimulated integrin activation. Taken together, storage up to 15 days in the cold appears to yield acceptable in vitro and in vivo results.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Alloimmunization following platelet transfusion can lead to rejection of subsequent transfusions and transplants. Recipient T cells are key mediators of the alloimmune response, and can recognize allogeneic MHC via either direct binding on donor cells or indirectly when donor antigens are presented by recipient antigen presenting cells. Prior work has shown pathogen reduction with riboflavin and UV light (UV+R) of allogeneic platelet rich plasma (PRP) prevents alloimmunization in mice, and provide partial antigen-specific tolerance to subsequent transfusions. in vitro work demonstrated the mechanism of UV+R treatment in preventing alloimmunization is associated with down-regulation of donor cell surface adhesion molecules that prevents direct recognition by allogeneic T cells. However, the role of T cells may be more complex in vivo involving either indirect recognition, or weak direct signals. To better understand how UV+R treatment regulates alloimunization, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the T cell response to allogeneic PRP transfusion in mice. Study Design/Method: White blood cell (WBC)-rich PRP was isolated from donor BALB/c or C57Bl/6 mice, left untreated, or treated with UV+R and transfused into C57Bl/6 mice. To evaluate the impact on secondary exposure, some were given a second transfusion of untreated WBC-rich PRP two weeks later. CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses were measured in the spleen and blood of recipient mice over time by flow cytometry. T cell activation, deletion and anergy were examined. Results/Finding: As expected, there was a significant upregulation of activation markers on T cells in the blood and spleen following transfusion with untreated allogeneic PRP. This included CD28, ICOS, and CD44, and peaked on day 7 (p < 0.0001). In contrast, mice that received a single UV +R transfusion showed no T cell response in blood or spleen although a small but significant enrichment of CD8 + CD28 + ICOS + T cells was observed in the blood on the seventh day after challenge (p < 0.002). Mice given UV+R PRP followed by untreated PRP displayed an early, but weaker and more transient response peaking around day 2 or 4 (p < 0.01). No evidence of deletion or anergy was observed in the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell compartment. Conclusion: Allogeneic CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses were significantly diminished after pathogen reduction with UV+R treatment. However, T cell allorecognition in vivo was not completely absent as a small but significant induction of activated CD8 + T cells was observed in the blood. The failure of a T cell alloresponse after UV+R treatment is not likely due to T cell deletion or anergy but possibly associated with active T cell tolerance or immune avoidance.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Antibodies generated against non-ABO red blood cell (RBC) antigens in response to transfusion are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronically transfused patients. Despite their clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms regulating the immune response to transfused RBCs remain poorly understood. Previous work in our lab (Arneja et al., 2016) demonstrated IL-6 deficient mice mount a significantly lower antibody response to RBC antigens. However, alloantibody production still occurred in the absence of IL-6, suggesting alternative pathways are capable of driving RBC alloimmunization. Since we observed an increase in Th2 skewing cytokines in response to transfusion in IL-6 deficient mice, we hypothesized that the key Th2 cytokine IL-4 and its downstream transcription factor STAT6 also drive RBC alloimmunization. Study Design/Method: We used a previously established RBC alloimmunization mouse model containing a fusion protein of hen egg lysozyme (HEL), Ovalbumin and the human Duffy antigen (HOD) on all RBCs as a model for RBC alloimmunization. Wild type, IL-4 deficient and STAT6 deficient mice were transfused with 12-day stored HOD blood. Sera were collected from these mice at various time points (2, 3, 5 and 7 weeks post transfusion) and total anti-HEL IgG titers were measured using ELISA. Results/Finding: While wild type mice elicited a robust IgG response against HEL, the response of IL-4 deficient mice was 5-fold lower (p=0.0015) at 2 weeks post transfusion. Similarly, antibody responses in STAT6 deficient mice were 10-fold lower (p=0.002) at 2 weeks post transfusion. Interestingly, at 7 weeks post transfusion IgG titers of STAT6 deficient mice was 40-fold lower (P = 0.025) compared to that of the wild type, demonstrating it also plays a role in antibody evanescence. All statistics were done using Student's t test using Holm-Sidak correction Conclusion: Ours is the first data to suggest a role of IL-4 and STAT6 in RBC alloimmunization. Ongoing studies in the lab are focused on uncovering the specific cell types on which IL-4 and STAT6 are active in response to transfused RBCs, and further how these pathways interact with the IL-6R pathway in controlling RBC alloimmunization. Background/Case Studies: The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important for membrane fluidity and cellular signaling. Dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA is associated with improved red blood cell (RBC) deformability, hydration, and membrane fluidity, along with reduced irreversible sickling and pain episodes in patients with sickle cell disease. However, PUFAs are not completely benign. They are highly susceptible to peroxidation in oxidative environments, potentially damaging RBC structure during aging or cold storage. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether diets enriched in PUFAs affect RBC lifespan and post-transfusion recovery (PTR). Study Design/Method: Mice from strains known to have good (C57BL/6) and poor (FVB) refrigerated RBC storage were fed a diet enriched in safflower or fish oil (n=15 mice/group) for 8 weeks. RBCs were biotinylated in vivo and lifespan measured by tracking biotinylated RBCs for 14 days. Leukoreduced blood was also prepared, and RBC deformability (LORCA and microsphiltration) and PTR were evaluated before and after 8 days of refrigerator storage. Metabolomics studies on fresh and stored blood were performed. Results/Finding: The RBC lifespan in C57BL/6 and FVB mice on a safflower diet was significantly greater than in the same strain on a fish oil diet (C57BL/6: 48.7d to 34.1d; FVB: 39.2d to 25.6d; both P<0.001). On the safflower oil diet, baseline RBC deformability was significantly higher in C57BL/6 as compared to FVB mice. Furthermore, RBC deformability was significantly decreased for both strains on the fish oil diet. When RBCs were transfused after 8-days of storage, PTR was significantly lower in the fish oil group for both strains (C57BL/6: 119% to 76%; FVB: 60% to 46%; P<0.0001 and P<0.05, respectively). There was also a strong correlation between PTR and deformability by LORCA (R 2 =0.9979) and microsphiltration (R 2 =0.9637). Metabolomics studies of plasma and RBCs revealed markedly lower levels of free and esterified carnitine in the fish oil group both before and after storage. Conclusion: These data suggest that diets containing very high levels of DHA and EPA from fish oil (30% kcal) are associated with decreased membrane deformability, in vivo lifespan, and PTR after cold storage. Carnitine modulates RBC fluidity due to its role in phospholipid repair, stabilization of spectrin-actin complexes, and sodium/potassium ATPase activity. The strong correlation between decreased carnitine levels, deformability, RBC lifespan, and PTR suggests potential mechanisms underlying these effects and identifies possible interventions for improving RBC quality. Background/Case Studies: Understanding megakaryocyte (MK) biology is critical to understanding and treating diseases that affect platelet production and function. However, procuring adequate numbers of this rare myeloid population remains rate-limiting. Most in vitro studies rely on MKs differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but there remains a lack of consensus on the optimal methods. Here, we present an optimized protocol for generating mature MKs from peripheral blood (PB) CD34 + cells with increased platelet production. Study Design/Method: We assessed the features and function of our MKs differentiated through our two-phase culture system using a set of \"gold standard\" metrics including morphology/ultrastructure (bright field and electron microscopy [EM]); cell surface marker expression, ploidy, and cell size (flow cytometry); cytoskeletal organization and granule content (confocal microscopy); and protein content (Luminex assay). We also quantified their release in static culture and bioreactor settings and characterized the resulting platelets at rest and upon activation.",

Size (14.2 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcm) and ploidy (58.5 \u00b1 23% \u2264 4N) of differentiated cells were consistent with values for MKs from cord blood-derived MKs. MKs contained F-actin and \u03b21-tubulin cytoskeletal elements characteristic of mature MKs, as well as markers of alpha-granules (VWF, PF4) and dense granules (thrombospondin, serotonin). Differentiated cells expressed growth factors (including EGF, VEGF, and PDGF) at levels similar to those found in human platelet lysate. Additionally, differentiated MKs produced proplatelets and functional platelets by day 7 in static culture, with a 3.5-fold increase in adult-like platelets produced using a novel bioreactor. Conclusion: Our differentiation protocol rapidly and consistently generates mature MKs from PB CD34 + HSCs. Despite resembling cord blood MKs in size and ploidy, these cells produce larger numbers of proplatelets than have been previously reported by as early as day 7 of differentiation. Background/Case Studies: The pathomechanisms of complications due to blood transfusion are not fully understood. Elevated levels of heme derived from stored RBCs are thought to be associated with transfusion reactions, especially inflammatory responses. Recently, the proinflammatory effect of heme has been widely studied. However, it is still unknown whether heme can influence the resolution of inflammation, a key step of inflammatory response, resulting in aggravation of inflammation. Study Design/Method: A murine model of self-limited peritonitis initiated by zymosan A was used. The effect of hemin on resolution was assessed by resolution indices. Western blot, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, chemotaxis assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, luciferase reporter assay, and lentivirus infections were used to investigate possible mediating mechanisms in neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells.",

In vitro, hemin significantly downregulated formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) protein levels (P < 0.05), a key resolution receptor, leading to the suppression of proresolution responses triggered by the proresolution ligand resolvin D1. Subsequently, four predicted miRNAs (miR-543, miR-144-3p, miR-181b-3p, and miR-410-3p), most likely binding to FPR2 3'-UTR, were identified by two prediction databases. Among these, miR-144-3p was significantly upregulated by hemin (P < 0.05). The inhibition of miR-144-3p attenuated the inhibitory effect of hemin on FPR2 protein expression (P < 0.05). Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-144-3p directly bound FPR2 3'-UTR. MiR-144-3p overexpression significantly downregulated FPR2 protein levels, whereas miR-144-3p inhibition led to a significant increase in FPR2 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that hemin prolongs resolution in self-limited inflammation, and this action is associated with downregulation of FPR2 mediated by hemin-induced miR-144-3p. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of hemin derived from stored RBCs for inflammatory response.",

It was suggested that sodium citrate be included in PAS to prevent spontaneous aggregation. Research in cancer cell lines has demonstrate that concentrations of sodium citrate present in current PAS formulations (10mM) causes apoptosis. In light of these data we evaluated whether the removal of sodium citrate from PAS-III could have a positive impact on platelet storage. Study Design/Method: Hyper concentrated apheresis platelet units $4.0 \u00d7 10 11 were collected on the Amicus from a normal, consenting donor. PAS-III without sodium citrate was added to $100 mL of hyper concentrated platelets to achieve a 35% platelet/plasma to 65% PAS ratio and rested for 1hr. The unit was then split into 4 polyolefin bags which were sealed in half. 60mL was added to each bag and increasing concentrations of sodium citrate were added to obtain a final concentration of 0, 2, 5, and 10mM. Platelet quality and function were assessed on Days 1, 5, and 7. Platelet count, pH, glucose, lactate, and blood gases were measured and quantitated. Surface markers were evaluated by flow cytometry which included CD62P, CD42b, Annexin V binding, and reactive oxygen species were measured using CM-H2DCFDA (n=4). Platelet function was assessed with aggregometry to collagen and TRAP6. Results/Finding: Platelet count and pH were acceptable and comparable throughout 7 days of storage regardless of PAS-III condition. Platelets stored for 5 days in PAS-III without sodium citrate(Cit) had significantly increased glucose levels (0mM Cit 2.75 \u00b1 0.38 mM, 10mM Cit 0.48 \u00b1 0.33 mM), and significantly decreased lactate levels (0mM Cit 9 \u00b1 0.8 mM, 10mM Cit 12.35 \u00b1 1.4 mM), ROS levels (0mM Cit 29 \u00b1 5 mM, 10mM Cit 127 \u00b1 53 mM), Annexin V positivity (0mM Cit 8.8 \u00b1 2%, 10mM Cit 20 \u00b1 4%), and P-selectin expression (0mM Cit 50 \u00b1 4%, 10mM Cit 66 \u00b1 3%) compared to those stored in 10mM citrate (p\u22640.05) (n=4). There was a trend toward better preservation of GPIb on the surface of platelets stored without sodium citrate. Platelets stored without citrate also showed a trend towards a greater extent of aggregation compared to those containing 10mM citrate (Collagen % aggregation 0mM Cit 89 \u00b1 2, 10mM Cit 54 \u00b1 18; TRAP % aggregation 0mM Cit 90 \u00b1 8, 10mM Cit 64 \u00b1 18). Conclusion: Removal of sodium citrate from PAS-III did not result in spontaneous platelet aggregation or clotting which could lead to decreased platelet counts during 7 days of storage. The absence of sodium citrate improved nearly all measured parameters. We demonstrate that sodium citrate has a contribution to the platelet storage lesion and its removal results in improved cell quality and function.",

It has previously been shown that pathogen reduction of PRP with riboflavin and UV light (UV+R) can protect against alloimmunization in mice and induce partial tolerance to subsequent transfusions. This study evaluated the relative contributions of major histocompatibility antigens (MHC) and minor antigens to both the alloresponse to PRP transfusion and the tolerance induced by UV+R treatment. Study Design/Method: C57Bl/6 mice were transfused with PRP from C57Bl/6 (syngeneic), BALB/c (allogeneic MHC and minor antigens), B6 H2d (allogeneic MHC only), UV+R B6 H2d, or UV+R B6 H2d followed by untreated B6 H2d 2 weeks later. BALB/c mice were transfused with PRP from C57Bl/6 (allogeneic MHC and minor antigens), B6 H2d (allogeneic minor antigens only), UV+R B6 H2d, or UV+R B6 H2d followed by untreated B6 H2d 2 weeks later. Two weeks after final transfusion, blood was screened for antibodies against the different donor type cells, and splenocytes were challenged ex vivo with the different donor type cells, and culture cytokines were measured to evaluate priming in vivo. Groups were compared using ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. Results/Finding: Both total and MHC specific antibody responses were highest when both MHC and minor antigens were mismatched, with lower antibody responses observed with MHC mismatch alone (p<0.05). There was a weak, but significant (p<0.01) alloantibody response to minor antigens only. UV+R treatment protected against both major and minor antigen alloimmunization. Both allogeneic MHC and minor antigens primed an enhanced cytokine response ex vivo, though this was weaker with minor antigens, and responses were blocked with UV+R treatment. Reduced cytokine responses were observed in the C57Bl/6 mice given UV+R treated B6 H2d PRP followed by untreated B6 H2d PRP (allogeneic MHC only), but not in the BALB/c mice given UV+R treated B6 H2d PRP followed by untreated B6 H2d PRP (allogeneic minor antigens only). Conclusion: Allogeneic MHC is sufficient to drive alloantibody production in our model and is responsible for the bulk of the alloantibody response. Minor alloantigens induce a small antibody response against themselves, and also enhance the anti-MHC response. While minor alloantigens can induce a weak cytokine response, allogeneic MHC is necessary and sufficient to induce tolerance using pathogen reduction technology.",

Despite the universal prescreening for alloantibodies in patients, transfusion complications are still a relatively common occurrence with delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions remaining the third leading cause of all transfusion-related fatalities in the USA. A major cause of morbidity and mortality is the remarkably high rate of evanescence in patients, with over 50% of all alloantibodies dropping below the level of detection within a year of their initial production. Molecular and cellular controllers of the high rate of anti-RBC evanescence are completely unknown.

Furthermore, higher rate of anti-RBC evanescence is likely due to decreased generation of both SLPCs and LLPCs relative to vaccination. Given that transfusion and vaccination generate similar early GC production, transfusion may induce a selective defect in extra-follicular plasma cell production. Background/Case Studies: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. In most patients the formation of pathogenic antiplatelet antibodies likely causes accelerated platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Anti-D (RhIg) is an effective first-line treatment for ITP but as a pooled donor-derived product, it comes with certain limitations. In addition, anti-D also carries an FDA-issued Black Box warning of serious complications that may occur in patients with ITP. To address if some of the potential side effects of anti-RBC antibodies can be separated from therapeutic activity, a murine model of passive ITP was utilized with two different anti-RBC antibodies. Two major adverse events were evaluated: 1) Anemia, as defined by a significant decrease in the RBC counts in the mice and 2) Inflammatory activity, as defined by a significant change in core body temperature. Study Design/Method: The monoclonal antibodies TER-119 and M1/69 recognizing different murine erythrocyte antigens were evaluated for their ability to ameliorate ITP in two well characterized inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) and the outbred CD-1 strain of mice. Erythrocyte numbers were evaluated over 8 days and compared to baseline counts from day 0. The body temperatures of the mice were measured rectally for 30 minutes post anti-RBC antibody injection. Results/Finding: Both TER-119 and M1/69 were able to ameliorate ITP in C57BL/6, BALB/c and CD-1 mice. TER-119 caused significant anemia (with a nadir at day 4) in all three mouse strains while M1/69 caused anemia only in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Dramatic reductions in the core body temperature were seen post TER-119 and M1/69 injections in CD-1 and BALB/c mice but no significant change in temperature was observed for C57BL/6 mice with either antibody. Conclusion: Both TER-119 and M1/69 were able to ameliorate ITP in all three strains of mice but anemia was only observed in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. We therefore conclude that anemia is not strictly required for ITP amelioration by anti-RBC antibodies in murine passive ITP. In addition, a change in body temperature (a major adverse event in mice) was observed for CD-1 and BALB/c mice but not C57BL/6 mice. We therefore also conclude that this inflammatory activity as assessed by body temperature is not required for ITP amelioration in murine passive ITP. Based on these conclusions, it may be possible to develop a monoclonal anti-RBC antibody that ameliorates ITP without causing these severe adverse events.",

Moreover, those shifted lncRNAs likely have a role in regulating platelet physiological function. Background/Case Studies: Blood units are stored as packed red blood cells (PRBC) at 2-6\u00b0C, presumably to minimize the storage-induced cell lesion. However, at 4\u00b0C water is at its' most compact packing, and undergoes abnormal structural processes, among them the breakage of hydrogen bonds which affects the water interactions with neighboring molecules. This implies that during the routine cold-storage PRBC are subjected to repeated temperature fluctuations below and above the 4\u00b0C critical temperature, and the respective volume/density variations. These anomalies are expected to induce acceleration of PRBC lesion. The study presented here was aimed at testing this hypothesis. Study Design/Method: Six PRBC units, leukofiltrated and stored in SAGM, were employed. Samples of PRBC were collected from each unit, stored in small storage bags and divided into two groups. Units from group A (gA) was stored in a routine blood bank refrigerator where the temperature fluctuated between 2.5-5.5\u00b0C, and units from group B (gB) was stored at 5-6\u00b0C, assuring that the temperature did not go below 5\u00b0C. The PRBC lesion was monitored by the change in cells deformability, determined immediately after processing the PRBC on Day 1 (D 1 ) and after 35 days of storage (D 35 ), using the cell flow properties analyzer (CFA). The cell shape-change is expressed by the change in the cell elongation ratio (ER), calculated for each cell as ER = a/b, where a and b are the major and minor cell axes, respectively. The CFA image analysis provides the ER distribution in large RBC population, from which the fraction of the low deformable cell (%LDFC, ER\u22641.5) in PRBC population was derived.",

            "text": "The Background/Case Studies: Despite the almost universal use of leukodepleted blood components, it has been shown that donor leukocyte engraftment (microchimerism) remains a long-term consequence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in some patient groups. The clinical consequences of having these remaining cells and the mechanism by which they survive following blood transfusion is unclear. Furthermore, the incidence of transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM) may be affected by international differences in blood processing methods or transfusion practices. In Australia, 10% of trauma patients were found to have TAM despite the introduction of universal leukodepletion of RBC units since October 2008. The incidence of TAM has not been extensively studied outside of the trauma setting. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of TAM in patients with a major thermal injury following RBC transfusion. Background/Case Studies: There is a growing concern about the risks in the transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC), following numerous studies reporting negative transfusion outcomes, including reduced blood perfusion. RBC have unique flow-affecting properties, particularly deformability and adherence to vascular endothelial cells, defining RBC hemodynamic functionality (HF), namely their capacity to affect blood flow. In the search for the mechanism behind the negative transfusion outcome, we explored the effect of PRBC HF on transfusion outcome in \u03b2-Thalassemia-Major (TM) patients (routinely treated with frequent, life-long transfusions) and elder blood recipients with non-hemolytic anemia. Study Design/Method: The effect of PRBC HF was examined by the transfusion-induced change in recipients' skin blood flow (\u0394SBF), hematocrit (\u0394Hct), and the time-interval between transfusions (TIBT). SBF was determined using a laser-Doppler-imager. PRBC deformability and adherence was determined using the/ a cell flow-properties analyzer (CFA). Results/Finding: In both groups of patients, \u0394SBF and \u0394Hct increased with increasing HF of the transfused PRBC, with a highly significant correlation. \u0394SBF was inversely proportional to the recipients' SBF before transfusion. The transfusion outcome also depended on the HF of the recipients' RBC (TR-RBC); when the PRBC HF was higher than that of the TR-RBC, the recipients' SBF increased (\u0394SBF>0), and inversely, when the PRBC HF was lower than that of the TR-RBC, the SBF decreased (\u0394SBF<0). In the TM patients, the time interval between consecutive transfusions increased with increasing PRBC HF, exhibiting highly significant dependence. Conclusion: This study provides, for the first time in humans, direct evidence that the HF of transfused PRBC is a potent effector of transfusion outcome. Determination of the PRBC HF vs. that of the recipient's RBC and conditions before transfusion can be used for selecting patient-specific blood units. Currently, PRBC are tested exclusively for immunological compatibility, and supplied primarily by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) criteria, while their functionality, the HF in particular, is completely ignored. The additional testing of RBC HF (of the transfused and the recipients RBC) introduces a new paradigm and technology into blood-banking, which would contribute substantially to improving transfusion therapy and enable personalized transfusion medicine. Background/Case Studies: Wnt signaling plays crucial roles in mammalian cells regulating aspects of cell fate, migration and polarity. Platelets posses many proteins of this signaling pathway; however, its role in platelet function is poorly understood. One study has shown that wnt3A inhibits platelet adhesion, shape change and aggregation. In this study, we investigated the role of wnt3A signaling in protein synthesis using its agonist sFRP-1 (soluble frizzled-releated protein) on washed and stored platelets. Study Design/Method: Levels of wnt3A and sFRP-1 were determined by immunoblot analyses of the respective proteins in plasma. Platelets (PLTs) prepared from whole blood collected in citrate as anticoagulant were washed with citrate-glucose-saline buffer and incubated with 50nM wnt3A, 300nM sFRP-1, wnt3A + sFRP-1 or kept untreated as control in the presence of 550 \u03bcM puromycin (Pm) followed by activation with 10 \u03bcM ADP for 15min. For storage experiments, aliquots of apheresis PCs were stored in small in-house prepared bags which mimic the storage features of common PLT bags. Two sets of aliquots were spiked with 550 \u03bcM Pm and 0, 150, 300 and 450nM sFRP-1 and stored for 4 and 8 days, respectively. PLT in vitro quality was assessed using platelet activation by CD62P binding, responsiveness in the presences of ADP in the CD62P assay, phosphatidyl-serine exposure by annexin-V binding and metabolic activity. Protein synthesis was monitored in lysates prepared in a Triton X-100-containing buffer by immunoblot analyses against Pm and determination of the band intensities using the Odyssey software on a Lycor imagining system. Results/Finding: The washed and activated PLTs showed a strong band pattern of synthesized proteins which was not affected by the presence of sFRP-1 or the combination of wnt3A and sFRP-1, but 2.4-fold reduced in the presence of wnt3A alone. For the storage study, we confirmed abundant amounts of wnt3A in plasma; however, the levels of sFR-1 were too low to be detected. Both on day 4 and day 8 of storage, sFRP-1 showed a concentration dependent 2-, 2.5-and 2.6-fold increase of Pm incorporation, respectively, compared to the untreated control. This trend was mirrored in increased glucose consumption and lactate production as well as platelet activation of 10 Background/Case Studies: Donated blood is processed in the blood bank for storage as packed red blood cells (PRBC). In the process of packed cell preparation (PCP), the blood is often subjected to removal of white cells by leukofiltration, to reduce the risk of adverse reactions. During this procedure, the RBC are exposed to high level of shear stress, which can induce alteration of the cell deformability.",

Study Design/Method: Blood samples were collected from 25 healthy volunteer donors, and from the corresponding units following their processing as PRBC (PCP), which included leukofiltration. RBC deformability was determined using a cell flow-properties analyzer (CFA). The cell shapechange is directly visualized in a narrow-gap flow-chamber under controllable flow-induced shear stress. The cell deformability is expressed by the change in the cell elongation ratio (ER), calculated for each cell as ER = a/ b, where a and b are the major and minor cell axes, respectively. The CFA image analysis provides the ER distribution in large RBC population, from which several deformability parameters are derived, including and the fraction of the rigid, undeformable cells in the RBC population (%UDFC, ER \u2264 1.1). The portion of undeformable cells was derived for each RBC sample, before and after PCP (%UDFC B and %UDFC A , respectively), and its change was calculated as \u0394%UDFC = %UDFC A -UDFC B .

That probably provokes the opposite phenomena; (a) removal/destruction of the rigid cells, thereby reducing their level, on one side, and (b) mechanical damage to the cell membrane and subsequent reduction of the cell deformability, thereby increasing the level of % UDFC. The results of this study support the existence of this phenomenon. Background/Case Studies: Blood group A and B antigens of the ABO system and FORS1 antigen of the Forssman system (FORS), as well as structurally related glycans, isoglobotriaosylceramide (iGb3) and \u03b11,3-galactosylepitope (\u03b11,3-Gal-epitope), are synthesized by the actions of evolutionarily related \u03b11,3-Gal(NAc) transferases with distinct glycosyltransferase activities and substrate specificities: Blood group A and B transferases (AT and BT), Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS), globotriaosylceramide synthase (iGb3S), and \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferase (GT), respectively. Previously, it was shown that the amino acids at codons 266 and 268 of human AT/BT are crucial to define their distinct sugar specificities, elucidating the molecular genetic basis of the ABO glycosylation polymorphism of clinical importance in transfusion and transplantation medicine. Study Design/Method: To better understand the structural basis of \u03b11,3-Gal(NAc) transferase diversification, we prepared eukaryotic expression constructs of those enzymes possessing AT-specific AlaGlyGly or Leu-GlyGly, BT-specific MetGlyAla, FS-specific GlyGlyAla, or iGb3S and GTspecific HisAlaAla tripeptide at the codons corresponding to 266-268 of human AT/BT. We then performed DNA transfection using appropriate recipient cells, existing and newly created, and immunologically examined the appearance of cell surface oligosaccharide antigens. Results/Finding: The immunocytochemistry results using monoclonal antiglycan antibodies after DNA transfection of expression constructs have revealed that several tripeptides other than the originals also bestowed transferase activity. Surprisingly, however, the repertoire of functional amino acids varied among those transferases. Quantification by FACS immunocytometry confirmed the differential effects on substrate specificities of \u03b11,3-Gal(NAc) transferases. Interestingly, we have also observed transferase activity not corresponding to the enzyme, namely FS activity of human ATs with AlaGlyGly or GlyGlyAla. Conclusion: The tripeptides at codons corresponding to 266-268 of human AT/BT also affect acceptor substrate specificities, in addition to the known function in determining donor nucleotide-sugar specificities, which may have contributed to the generation of a diverse family of \u03b11,3-Gal(NAc) transferases. Excluding primates, where LeuGlyGly is predominant, the Ala-GlyGly tripeptide is frequently present in ATs from many vertebrate species. Therefore, it is possible that those ATs may also exhibit FS activity under certain conditions where appropriate acceptor substrates are present. If this is the case, two genetic loci, GBGT1 and ABO, rather than GBGT1 alone, may specify FORS1 expression in those species. Background/Case Studies: The in vitro production of blood platelets is an important goal for transfusion in the present context of a sustained demand for controlled products free of infectious, immune and inflammatory risks. It is currently possible to produce platelets in vitro. However, for cultured platelets to be considered as a real alternative to transfusion, it is of paramount importance to demonstrate that these platelets are free of contaminants, such as nucleated cells or non-platelet cellular fragments. Study Design/Method: The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an acoustic-based fractionation device to separate newly released platelets from residual megakaryocytes (MK) and cytoplasmic debris (CD). Platelets are produced in vitro from peripheral blood-derived CD34 progenitors following the protocol described in Strassel et al., Blood 2016. Platelets are released from the cell suspension following successive pipetting. Platelet recovery and purity are compared following standard centrifugation and fractionation using an acoustophoresis-based device that allows the separation of two objects with different acoustic properties. Results/Finding: Fractionation using a combination of two acoustic devices led to a significant reduction in the number of residual MK and CD MVs were obtained from cell-and debris-depleted PRBC supernatants by differential centrifugation and counted by high-sensitivity flow cytometry. Concomitantly, RBC deformability was determined using a cell flow-properties analyzer in which RBC shape-change is directly visualized in an arrow-gap flow-chamber and monitored as a function of shear stress. The cell deformability is expressed by the cell elongation ratio (ER), ER = a/b, where a and b = long and short axes of the cell, respectively. This calculation applies to each cell and provides the ER distribution in a large RBC population, enabling the derivation of several deformability measures such as the median ER (MER) and the percent of low deformable cells in the population (%, LDFC). Results/Finding: As shown in Table 1 , the MV level in the PRBC supernatant was inversely correlated with the RBC deformability (MER), and positively correlated with the fraction of the relatively rigid cells (%LDFC), both measures showing highly significant logarithmic dependence with MV levels.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the therapeutic effect of infusion of leukocyte-depleted frozen platelets and leukocyte-depleted fresh platelets. Study Design/Method: 110 patients with thrombocytopenia were selected, including 45 males and 65 females, aged 23-66 years, all of whom were given the first blood transfusions.

They were randomly divided into two groups, of which 53 patients were infused with leukocytedepleted frozen platelets and 57 patients were infused with leukocytedepleted fresh platelets. The infusion of platelet was completed within 30 minutes at a rate that the patient could tolerate. The patients were tested for bleeding time before infusion, 1 hour after infusion, and elevation of platelet count in peripheral blood 24 hours after infusion. The data were statistically processed, the measurement data was checked by t test, and the enumeration data was analyzed with chi-square test. Results/Finding: There was no significant difference in the general data between the two groups (P>0.05).

Background/Case Studies: Human platelet lysate (HPL) contains abundant growth factors and cytokines boosting in vitro cell proliferation. A growing number of institutions use HPL as alternative to animal sera for manufacturing of cell-based medicinal products. Addition of porcine heparin is default to prevent HPL-supplemented media from clotting. To achieve an animal component-free culture system, a protocol for mechanical depletion of fibrinogen and coagulation factors has recently been introduced. Study Design/Method: In this study, we investigated the so far unclear influence of heparin on gene expression of stromal cells derived from umbilical cord (UC), white adipose tissue (WAT) or bone marrow (BM; each n=3). Stromal cells were isolated and propagated using HPL plus heparin vs. fibrinogen-depleted HPL plus/minus heparin. Whole genome microarrays were analyzed using R/Bioconductor followed by confirmative qRT-PCR. Immunophenotype, in vitro differentiation, proliferation, clonogenicity and immunomodulatory potency were investigated. Cell uptake of heparin was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Background/Case Studies: Accurate and precise red blood cells (RBC) quantification in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) products is important for processing and clinical aspects of stem cell transplantation. ABO or antigen/antibody mismatched RBCs can cause deleterious effects in SCT recipients, and products with >20 mLs may be subject to RBC reduction to an acceptable level for infusion. RBC quantification in the context of varying total product volumes and RBC amounts is performed regularly, but little is reported about the specific performance characteristics of RBC quantification in HSCT products from different sources, of different quantities and of varying RBC amounts and the potential effect on SCT processing. Study Design/Method: SCT product samples at a hospital-based cellular therapy laboratory undergo parallel determination of RBC content based on hematocrit (Hct) measurement by manual and automated methods. Manual hematocrit (mHct) was performed by centrifugation and direct observation, and automated hematocrit (aHct) was performed on a Sysmex automated hematology analyzer after 1:10 dilution. RBC volume was determined by multiplying Hct by product volume (mL). Samples were grouped by SCT source of apheresis (HPC-A) or bone marrow harvest (HPC-M). HPC-A products were further subgrouped by apheresis instruments used: Spectra Optia (Terumo BCT) or Amicus (Fresenius Kabi). Retrospective analysis of mHct and aHct was performed to determine if statistically significant differences between measurements exist by paired two-tailed student's t test, and if that resulted in crossing the threshold of 20 mLs RBC volume. Results/Finding: 154 SCT products were analyzed, 121 HPC-A products from 1/1/2018 -4/17/2018, and 33 HPC-M products from 1/1/2017 -4/18/2018. 106 and 15 HPC-A samples were collected on the Spectra Optia and Amicus apheresis instruments, respectively. 5 HPC-A products crossed the threshold of 20 mLs RBC volume: 4 HPC-A SCT products with >20 mLs RBCs with mHct fell below threshold with aHct, and 1 HPC-A SCT product < 20 mLs RBCs with mHct crossed the threshold with aHct. 4 of 5 of the affected products were collected on the Amicus. All HPC-M SCT products were >20mLs RBCs by either method.",

Additional samples are needed to further analyze Hct differences in HPC-A products collected on the Amicus, and additional studies are warranted to determine impact on cellular therapy laboratory workflow and patient outcomes. Background/Case Studies: Genome editing with engineered nucleases, such as RNA-guided nucleases (CRISPR-Cas9), allows targeted genetic manipulations and holds great promise for the treatment of inherited and acquired disorders. However, the efficiency of genome editing is a limiting factor when large enough quantities of correctly edited cells are required. We recently devised a robust co-selection strategy by generating dominant cellular resistance to ouabain, a highly potent plant-derived inhibitor of the ubiquitous and essential sodium/potassium pump (encoded by the ATP1A1 gene). Using CRISPR technologies, we can generate ouabain-resistant alleles in ATP1A1 to coselect for corrective editing events at a second locus of interest. Faithful in vitro modeling of erythropoiesis to study specific genetic variants would be a useful tool for investigating gene function and help guide the management of complex clinical cases in the field of transfusion medicine. Study Design/Method: In this work, we have exploited CRISPR-based gene editing and ouabain co-selection strategies combined with a HSC-erythroid differentiation protocol to develop a cellular model showcasing desired genetic variants. We used a three-step culture method to efficiently produce cultured red blood cells (cRBC) from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Results/Finding: This erythroid-differentiation procedure yielded an average of 20, 000-fold expansion and $90% enucleation by day 18 when using mobilized peripheral blood HSPCs as a cell source. For gene-modification strategies, purified HSPCs were incubated in erythroid expansion medium for 24 h upon thawing, and then electroporated with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing beta-globin (HBB) and ATP1A1directed guide RNAs, along with ssODNs aimed at inserting the sickle cell anemia-causing mutation (HbS) and ATP1A1's ouabain-resistance allele. Three days following transfection, ouabain treatment was added, and the differentiation protocol was continued up to day 18. On day 11 of culture, over 60% precise gene modification was obtained at the HBB locus. Background/Case Studies: Hematopoietic progenitor cells are typically cryopreserved using controlled rate freezers (CRF). Recently our lab observed an 8-9% increase in unacceptable freezing curves i.e., not meeting expected freezing curve parameters. Cryopreservation bag manufacturer (OriGen) recommends a maximum fill volume range but does not suggest an optimal minimum volume. It was theorized that lower than optimal freezing volumes could produce unacceptable freezing curves, and by determining the minimum volume one could lessen the rate of unsatisfactory freezing curves. Study Design/Method: A retrospective document review was performed on all clinical cell therapy product freezing curves from 12/1/15-3/24/17. In that timeframe, 240 freezing curves were generated and of those 20 were suboptimal. Nearly all unacceptable curves demonstrated an additional temperature spike prior to the heat of fusion. Many variables were examined for potential cause, including cell type, cell concentration, CRF calibration date, preventative maintenance performed and product volume. All products with unacceptable freezing curves were sampled for viability (acridine orange/ propidium iodide) using a frozen tubing segment.",

Various volumes of water were added to the 250mL and 500mL OriGen CryoStore\u2122 Freezing Bags, 250mL bags were each filled with 50, 60, 70 and 80mL of water; 500mL bags were filled with 90, 110, 130, and 150mL of water. Bags were placed in a press and depths were measured and recorded and the various fill volumes were compared to the depth of the canister. Results/Finding: The most common factor of the unacceptable freezing curves was a low product volume, as compared to the recommended maximum fill volume. The viabilities on all of the thawed segments were found to be acceptable at >70%. Conclusion: Fill volume plays a critical role in the ability of the sample probe to make continuous contact with the product bag. If the fill volume is low the bag may not contain sufficient weight to ensure continuous contact with the sample probe, undergoing or appearing to undergo a premature temperature spike during the initial cooling phase of the CRF. By comparing the fill volumes to the depth of the canister it was determined that the minimum depth for the 250mL CryoStore\u2122 bag was 7.8mm (75mL of water) and the minimum depth for the 500mL bag was 8.9-9.5mm (130-150mL of water). Based on the data, we established a minimum volume of 70mL for the 250mL CryoStore\u2122 bag and \u2265 135mL for 500mL bags. Since instituting minimum fill volumes, the frequency of suboptimal freezing curves has decreased to <1%. Background/Case Studies: The optimal cell concentration of cryopreserved autologous HPC, apheresis products published in the literature is less than 3 \u00d7 10^8 nucleated cells (NC) per ml. However, products with higher cell concentrations are more pragmatic for cell processing facilities, and may potentially reduce patient complications related to the total volume of product reinfused. Study Design/Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of post-thaw viability, neutrophil recovery, and platelet recovery to compare product and clinical outcomes between patients who received only lower concentration (<3 \u00d7 10^8 NC per mL), or only higher concentration (\u22653 \u00d7 10^8 NC per mL) products. Autologous HPC, apheresis products were collected from 113 consecutive mobilized patients, processed to a fixed final product volume with variable cell concentrations, cryopreserved in 7.5% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) using a controlled rate freezer, and held in vapor phase over liquid nitrogen in monitored storage below -150\u00b0C. Results/Finding: All 221 cryopreserved HPC, apheresis products from 66 multiple myeloma patients and 47 lymphoma patients were included in the product outcomes analysis (see Table 1 ). The median cell concentration was 2.72 \u00d7 10^8 NC per mL in the lower concentration group compared to 4.10 \u00d7 10^8 NC per mL in the higher concentration group. There were no between-group differences in the median post-thaw viability (79% vs. 78%, P=0.49). All 92 patients included in the clinical outcomes analysis received at least a total of 3 \u00d7 10^6 CD34 + cells per kilogram (see Table 1 for exclusions), and there were no between-group differences in the total CD34 + cells per kilogram reinfused (6.31 vs. 6.12, P=1.00). Using CIBMTR definitions of recovery, the median days to neutrophil recovery (13 vs. 14, P=0.06) and platelet recovery (15 vs. 16, P=0.06) were not different. Conclusion: The post-thaw viability, neutrophil recovery, and platelet recovery were not different between patients who received only lower concentration (<3 \u00d7 10^8 NC per mL), or only higher concentration (\u22653 \u00d7 10^8 NC per mL) products.

Due to the indefinite retention of cryopreserved products, the footprint of a large liquid nitrogen (LN2) freezer, and adequate connections to an LN2 supply, space requirements are challenging. To meet the storage demands, an off-site storage facility was commissioned. The large-scale transport of cellular therapy products has not been previously described. Study Design/Method: Case Study Results/Finding: The primary risks involved with transporting products is damage to frozen products and tanks themselves. The transport of small numbers of products increases the likelihood of warming events as well as the need to handle each product. Overall time for the relocation would be prohibitively increased. Therefore, moving of filled tanks was selected. A trial move of a freezer was performed to assess the effectiveness of all measures taken. A run was mapped out that had smooth roads (absence of potholes, railroad tracks, etc). A custom pallet with air dampened cushions and a hard rubberized surface was made that would offer shock absorption and support the weight of a full LN2 tank. Precision jacks and lifts were used to raise and lower the tank with full control. Masonite sheeting was laid on the tiled hallways for smoother transport. A moving truck with an air suspension system was used for the transport. A fully validated and functioning LN2 tank was filled with 61 frozen products (either mock or deceased patient products). The tank was slowly placed onto the pallet using jacks. It was secured with straps and put into the back of the moving truck. The pallet was secured into place in the truck to ensure it didn't move.",

Background/Case Studies: Autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation requires mobilization of HPC to peripheral blood. Mobilization is performed with the administration of G-CSF alone (G) or associated with chemotherapy (G/CT). HPC products obtained by these two methods present difference in cell content, which could result in different clinical outcomes, such as hematologic recovery and adverse reactions (AR) to product infusion. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate rates of AR to product infusion according to type of cell mobilization, G-CSF alone or associated with chemotherapy. Study Design/Method: A total of 611 patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) underwent mobilization and harvesting of HPC for autologous transplantation over the last 15 years, 267 with G and 344 with G/CT (285 of whom underwent transplantation at our institution). The apheresis procedure results in 2 bags (100 mL each), which are cryopreserved with DMSO at 10% and kept in liquid nitrogen container until thawed and infused. The evaluated AR were nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, arrhythmia, dyspnea and neurologic abnormalities (cephalea and encephalopathy) (5 possibilities of AR for each patient) during cell infusion or just after its completion. Results/Finding: Median (range) age were 54 (46-60) and 41 (29-55) years for groups G and G/CT, respectively (p < 0.0001).

Hematologic recovery (neutrophil \u2265 500/\u03bcL) occurred on day 12 (11-14) and 11 (10-12) for G and G/CT groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). AR occurred in 58.27% and 50.94% of patients in groups G and G/CT, respectively (p = 0.234), however, the number of reactions were 132 (in 635 possibilities) and 126 (in 795 possibilities) in G and G/CT groups, respectively (p = 0.016).

Female gender was associated with a higher rate of nausea/vomiting (23.84% vs 46.49%. p = 0.0001). Conclusion: Mobilization of HPC with G-CSF alone has many advantages, although it results in higher number of unwanted cells such as granulocytes and platelets (and less CD34 cells) in final product, which can explain. at least in part, the higher rate of adverse reactions during cell infusion that was observed. Finally, mobilization with G-CSF alone results in fewer CD34 cells transplanted and a protracted hematologic recovery.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) have become the predominant graft source for adult allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in recent years. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the standard agent for PBSC mobilization. In poorly mobilized autologous donors, plerixafor is often added to improve collection outcomes. Up to 5% of allogeneic donors mobilize poorly with G-CSF only. In this study we reviewed our experiences with using plerixafor as a rescue agent in poorly mobilized allogeneic donors. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively examined all allogeneic PBSC collections from January 2013 to March 2018 at our center. Donors received G-CSF 10 mcg/kg daily for four days before undergoing apheresis collection on Day 5. Collections were performed with the MNC protocol on the COBE Spectra, Optia or Amicus apheresis instruments, and 18-20 liters of blood were processed over 6 hours. The goal of collection was 4.0x10 6 CD34 + cells/kg recipient weight. Plerixafor was added based on poor CD34 + cell collection yield after the first or second collection day. Results/Finding: Of the 851 allogeneic donors, 10 (1.2%) received one dose of plerixafor in addition to G-CSF on the first (8) or the second (2) day of collection due to poor collection yield. Plerixafor was well tolerated in all donors without significant adverse reactions. The CD34 + cell yield before (CTI20) Background/Case Studies: A minimum dose of 2 \u00d7 10^6/kg CD34 + cells is desired for autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HPC) transplantation to treat hematopoietic malignancies. The yield of CD34 + cells obtained by apheresis collection is largely predicted by peripheral blood CD34 + concentration (PCD34). Therefore, a common standard for proceeding with apheresis is a PCD34 of \u2265 20/uL as determined by flow cytometry (flow). By this criteria, some autologous HPC transplant candidates may be disqualified on the basis of poor anticipated collection yields. The goal of this study is to determine if alternative treatment options are not available and PCD34 is too low to report, should these patients still proceed to apheresis collection and transplant. Namely, can the minimum dose of CD34 + cells be obtained? If so, how many collections are required? Additionally, does the numerous number of collections have a negative impact on engraftment? Study Design/Method: Patients (n=54) with PCD34 too low to accurately report by flow (initial cutoff < 0.02%, changed to < 0.04%) using the International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering protocol were included in the study. Retrospective review of apheresis, laboratory, and electronic medical records was performed to collect data including diagnosis, number of patients who proceeded to transplant, mobilization regimen, number of collection attempts, number of apheresis procedures, apheresis method, CD34 dose collected and infused, neutrophil and platelet engraftment.",

Almost all patients (n=51, 94%) were mobilized with neupogen and plerixafor (N/P). The Spectra Optia \u00ae was used to collect and process 3 blood volumes in 49 (91%) patients. Of the 8 (15%) patients who did not proceed to transplant, 6/8 (75%) were not transplanted because the minimum dose of 2 \u00d7 10^6/kg CD34 + cells could not be collected. All 6 patients were mobilized with N/P, and 2 attempts to collect after rest were made in 5/6 cases. These 6 patients underwent a mean of 4 apheresis procedures (range 3-6) and collected a mean of 0.91 \u00d7 10^6/ kg CD34 + cells (range 0-1.90 \u00d7 10^6/kg). Of the 46 (85%) patients who did proceed to transplant, 11 (24%) required > 1 collection attempts. A mean of 4 apheresis procedures (range 1-9) were required to collect \u22652 \u00d7 10^6/kg CD34 + cells. The mean CD34 dose collected was 3.79 \u00d7 10^6/kg (range 2.05-7.04\u00d710^6/kg) and the mean CD34 dose infused was 3.65 \u00d7 10^6/kg (range 2.01-7.04\u00d710^6/kg). There were no incidents of delayed neutrophil engraftment (\u226415 days). One (2%) patient demonstrated delayed platelet engraftment (\u226530 days) and one (2%) patient failed to engraft platelets. Conclusion: Despite a PCD34 too low to report by flow, 85% of patients were able to collect \u22652 \u00d7 10^6/kg CD34 + cells after a mean of 4 apheresis collections and proceed to transplant. There were no cases of delayed neutrophil engraftment, and only infrequent cases of delayed or failed platelet engraftment. Therefore, disqualifying patients with no other treatment options from HPC transplant based on low PCD34 alone may deny patients of life prolonging or lifesaving therapy.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Many transplant centers still process a fixed number of liters or total blood volumes for hematopoietic progenitor cell collection. Prediction algorithms to achieve target CD34 dose have been validated, primarily in autologous donors, but not widely adopted, perhaps due to ease of use. We thus validated in allogeneic donors a simple prediction algorithm, based on our center-specific 25 th percentile CD34 collection efficiency (CE), to directly calculate the number of liters to achieve CD34 target. Because CD34 CE is reported lower in allogeneic versus autologous donors, we also tested whether using the Cobe Spectra CFR tool, based on pre-apheresis MNC count, results in higher CD34 CEs compared to historical controls collected at a standard 1-1.5 ml/min. Study Design/Method: This retrospective, single-center analysis analyzed 96 allogeneic donors (93 NMDP, 3 related) collected with the Cobe Spectra MNC (n=55) or the Spectra Optia CMNC (n=41) procedures from Jan 2017 to Feb 2018. Peripheral blood CD34 counts drawn 0-1 hr pre-apheresis were used to calculate rounded-up liters to process as follows: (total target product CD34 (\u00d7 10 6 )) / (pre-CD34 per ul \u00d7 0.4). Because the actual/predicted liters to process varied (median 1.0, mean 1.2 \u00b1 0.51), the actual CD34 dose collected was adjusted as follows: (actual total product CD34 \u00d7 10 6 )/ (actual volume processed/predicted volume to process). CD34 CE using the MNC-guided Cobe CFR tool was compared to NMDP historical controls (n=57) collected with the Cobe Spectra MNC procedure with a fixed CFR of 1-1.5 ml/min. Results/Finding: The adjusted CD34 dose achieved the target goal in 92% (88 of 96) of patients processing a median 2.5 donor TBV (range 1.1-6.2). The adjusted CD34 dose was a median 1.30 (range 0.85-2.19) and mean 1.37 (SD 0.28) times the predicted CD34 dose. The correlation between adjusted and target total CD34 was 0.79, due to variation in CD34 CE, evident by the 0.97 correlation between CD34 CE and adjusted/target CD34 ratio. The table shows CFR-relevant data. Weak correlations between CFR and 1) product granulocyte % (r=0.30) and 2) platelet CE1 (r=0.45) were seen, but their means were similar to those previously reported in allogeneic donors with a mean 1.5 TBV processed (Cancelas JA, Transfusion 2016). Conclusion: Our easy to use prediction algorithm using a conservative CE for volume to process may achieve a higher percent of collections reaching target CD34 dose compared to prediction algorithms based on regression analysis (Leberfinger, Transfusion 2017). Using an MNC-guided rather than fixed CFR may increase CD34 CE.",

All patients were mobilized with daily 10 mcg/kg GSCF following chemotherapy. Plerixafor was administered 12-16 hours prior to 3 collection procedures. Pre-and post-procedure lab values were: mean pre-hematocrit (Hct) 29.2% (range 22.3-37.1), post-Hct 27.9% (range 21.9-35.6); mean preplatelet count 87.4K/\u03bcL (range 37-228), post-platelet count 47.2K/\u03bcL (range 21-71); mean pre-WBC 17.1K/\u03bcL (range 2.48-59.1), post-WBC 13.5 (range 2.7-37.6).

Most of the cord blood banks measure potency by using a colony-forming unit culture method (CFU), which delays the release of CBU by 7 to 14 days. To accelerate the distribution process of CBU, we developed a rapid method, based on the measurement of the response of CD34 + cells to interleukin-3 (IL-3). This IL-3 test is based on flow cytometry measurement of STAT5 phosphorylation on tyrosine-694 within CD34 + cells. Our IL-3 test was compared to the CFU method, currently considered as the gold standard, as well as the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme-based assay. Study Design/Method: Ten cryopreserved CBU, aliquoted in tubes, were thawed following standard operating procedures (SOP) and analyzed for their content in CD34 + and CD45 + viable cells using the ISHAGE protocol. The ECLONE, a ratio of CBU numbers on pre-freezing CD34 cell numbers, and the proportions of ALDHBright cells and IL-3 -responsive CD34 + cells (IL-3 test), were determined for each CBU. We used samples stored for 24 hours at room temperature (RT) post-thawing to simulate an extreme warming case scenario, as well as a milder warming event by storing samples for 2-5 days at -80\u00b0C before thawing.

In addition, the CBB has provided over 40,000 research CBUs to academic institutions, research laboratories and the industry. In all cases, research CBUs are provided without identifiers, and with mother's IRB-approved consent. The exchange of scientific, technical and logistical information between investigators and the CBB was managed predominantly via email, however, this approach is time-consuming for all parties, and may be associated with unnecessary delays. To improve communications and expedite the acquisition of CBUs with the specific characteristics required for the various laboratory studies, the CBB has established an efficient web-based application (WebResearch) to support the distribution of research CBUs. Results/Finding: The CBB WebResearch facilitates transactions such as: ordering research CBUs, providing automatic real time email confirmations/ notifications, uploading shipping documents, checking order status, tracking shipping information, allowing users to search for previous orders using various fields and print/upload reports of orders, etc., with bidirectional flow of communication. The CBUs provided for research can be: a) fresh, unprocessed, non-clinical grade units within 48 hours from collection, with limited information and no infectious disease testing, or b) frozen CBUs that have undergone volume-reduction, cryopreservation and storage in liquid Nitrogen, but do not meet criteria for clinical use. For those, an array of data may be available such as blood counts, flow cytometry data, bacteriology results, hemoglobin phenotypes, HLA typing, maternal infectious disease markers and blood group types. Background/Case Studies: At the frontier of transfusion medicine and transplantation, the field of Cellular Therapy (CT) is emerging. Most novel CT products are produced under investigation with no clear standardization across Cell Processing Centers. Across institutions the manufacturing protocols may vary depending on the type of CT product. The purpose of this study was to uncover any variations in manufacturing practices for similar CT products across different Cellular Processing Laboratories in institutions worldwide. Study Design/Method: An Exploratory survey to identify variations in manufacturing practices in novel CT products was designed and sent to Cellular Processing Laboratory Directors worldwide. The questionnaire focused first, on the processing methods used with regards to the type of CT being processed and also on five stages of the processing event: 1. collection, 2. purification, 3. in vitro expansion, 4. freezing and storage, and 5. thawing and washing. Secondly, the questionnaire focused on the level of environmental monitoring (EM) used for each CT product. Results/Finding: Out of 67 respondents to the survey, 56 had a Cellular Processing Laboratory. Thirty-one processed products under an investigational label, for either Phase I/II (n=27) or Phase III (n=17) clinical trials. HPC products, from peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), or cord blood (CB) were the most commonly processed by 75 % of the respondents. Lymphocytes (L) were the most commonly non-HPC products and handled under all five processing stages (i.e. 18 facilities). Similarly, facilities handling dendritic cells (DCs) (n=9), natural killer (NK) cells (n=8), and/or mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) (n=13) processed these products under all five processing stages. A minority of centers (<5) processed pancreatic islet cells (n=4), neural cells (n=3) and iPSCs (n=2). Purification methods varied for each type of product and by institutions (n) ( Table 1) . The EM, used for each CT product, is shown in Table 2 .",

Eighteen vials from 9 donors (2 vials/donor) were thawed for paired viability measurements at 4\u00b0C and RT 0-96 hours post-thaw. The interaction between temperature and time was statistically significant (p=0.0088) indicating that time does not have the same effect on total cell viability at both temperatures. Time (p<0.0001) but not temperature (p=0.19) was found to significantly affect total cell viability post-thaw. Mean post-thaw viabilities for cells stored at 4\u00b0C and RT declined over time ( Table 1 ). The matching effectiveness was statistically significant (p<0.0001). No statistically significant differences were found in the mean viabilities for cells at each time point. The mean immediate (0 hour) post-thaw cell viability at 4\u00b0C and RT (70% vs 69%, p>0.05) met our acceptability criteria for post-thaw viability of \u00b360%. Cells stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 hour retained a viability (62%) greater than our acceptability criteria but cells stored at RT for up to 1 hour did not (viability of 57%). Conclusion: Total cell viability of HSC products decreases over time after thawing when stored at both 4\u00b0C and RT with a more rapid decline at Background/Case Studies: One of the major challenges in Laboratory Medicine is addressing the evolving needs of the patient's that we serve. These needs are increasingly met with limited resources. In the Hematopoietic Progenitor Stem cell Transplant Patient (HPSCT) population, mobilization regimens (drugs that increase the availability of stem cells for apheresis) have evolved. We subjectively felt that the use of new mobilization regimens resulted in increases in the required numbers of collections per patient resulting in increased technologist effort, increased usage of flow cytometry (specifically, donor pre-apheresis and apheresis product CD34 quantification), and increasing processing and reagent requirements. The purpose of this study was to provide objective data regarding the impact of evolving mobilization regimens on Blood Transfusion Service resources. Study Design/Method: We reviewed patient's medical records and Blood Transfusion Service records, including apheresis, processing and flow cytometry records. We documented mobilization regimens, required numbers of collections, total cells per collection, (total cells per kilogram body weight), and concentration ( diseases (AID) unresponsive to conventional therapy. This treatment aims to ablate auto-reactive clones of T and B cells, allowing the regeneration of a new and tolerant immune system. Mobilization and harvesting of HPC from the peripheral blood is an essential part of this therapy. HPC mobilization includes administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), alone or in combination with chemotherapy, aiming to harvest at least 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/Kg. This retrospective study had the purpose to analyze the mobilization characteristics according to each specific AID. Study Design/Method: A total of 193 patients were enrolled: Multiple sclerosis (MS) 101; Systemic sclerosis (SSc) 83; and Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 9. CD34 + cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (Cy 2 g/ m 2 ) associated with a median (range) G-CSF dose of 9.4 (4.9-12.5) \u03bcg/Kg/ day, initiated on the day following Cy administration and continued daily until cell harvesting. Autoimmune disease groups were not different for G-CSF dose. Harvesting was initiated when peripheral blood CD34 + cell counts reached a minimum of 10/mL. One patient with SLE failed to mobilize. Aphereses were performed using the cell separator COBE Spectra (Caridian BCT\u00d4, Lakewood, CO, USA). Collected HPC products were cryopreserved in a solution with dimethyl sulphoxide at 10%. Cell bags were placed into metallic racks and inserted into a -80 \u00baC freezer, where they were kept until thawed and infused, one to three months later. . Neutrophil recovery took place on day 9 (7-19), 10 (9-15), and 11.5 (9-13) for MS, SSc, and SLE, respectively (p < 0.001, MS vs SSc***, MS vs SLE**). HPC were harvested on day 8 (7-11), 8 (7.5-12), and 9 (8-11) of mobilization for MS, SSc, and SLE, respectively (p = 0.011, MS vs SLE**, SSc vs SLE*). Blood volumes processed were not different between AID groups. Most patients underwent a single session of apheresis, however 4 (50%) SLE, 1 (1%) MS and 5 (6%) SSc patients required 2 days (MS vs SLE: p < 0.001; SSc vs SLE: p = 0.0015). Conclusion: Patients with AID are efficient HPC mobilizers under the G-CSF plus 2g/m 2 cyclophosphamide regimen. Patients with SLE yield a lower number of mobilized HPC, and thus a lower number of collected CD34 + cells, than those with MS and SSc, despite higher days of apheresis.",

Retrieval of a CBU from a manual liquid nitrogen dewar for shipment to a cell therapy center can involve exposure of the neighboring units in the rack to ambient air temperatures. We sought to investigate the impact of removing a CBU from storage on neighboring units by evaluating the post-thaw unit viability (PTUV) of CBUs released from the same dewar and same rack after different lengths of storage. Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data for CBU releases from a private cord blood bank. To control for the variety of methods to determine viability, only CBUs with available PTUV data obtained by trypan blue were included. CBUs were classified as either the first or subsequent release from the same dewar and rack (Group 1 and 2 respectively). Randomly selected CBUs released from the same dewar as Groups 1 & 2 but a different rack and CBUs selected at random from different dewars served as controls (Group 3 and 4 respectively). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to examine differences with p-values < 0.5 considered significant. Data analyses were performed using STATA software (STATA Corp LP). Results/Finding: 292 of 440 units released had PTUV based on trypan blue staining. 36 CBUs (n=9 in each group) were included in the final analysis with 18 units, representing 9 pairs, released from the same dewar and rack. There were no significant differences in pre-cryopreservation unit viability between Group 1 and Groups 2, 3 and 4, respectively. There was no significant difference in PTUV between primary and secondary CBU releases from the same dewar and rack and PTUV of Group 1 and Groups 3 and 4 were similarly comparable. Conclusion: While this study is based on an actual use scenario, it is limited by the small sample size of paired units released from the same dewar and rack. However, our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that removal of a cord blood unit from a conventional dewar under controlled and validated procedures does not affect the post-thaw viability of neighboring units. Conventional dewars and procedures for manual retrieval are consistent with regulatory guidelines and standards established to prevent loss of product quality during the normal lifecycle of a cryopreserved product.",

Additionally, in the pediatric population, it is often necessary to reduce the overall product volume for patients with a low body weight. The Spectra Optia BMP platform provides a reliable method of bone marrow processing that yields a safe infusion product. Study Design/Method: A 2-phase concurrent validation was performed on 7 products infused to patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from ABO incompatible donors. Products were processed on the Spectra Optia per manufacturers recommendations and evaluated for TNC, MNC, and CD34 + recovery and residual red cell volume. The second phase of the validation was performed with the goal of improving MNC recovery. Institution specific acceptable parameters are: MNC and CD34 + recovery of \u2265 70%, TNC recovery of \u2265 25% and incompatible RBC volume of \u2264 0.3 ml/kg recipient body weight. Results/Finding: Validation results are summarized in the Table. In Phase I, 1 of 4 products had MNC recovery \u226570%. In Phase II, MNC recovery exceeded the desired parameter of \u226570%. All samples had acceptable CD34 + and TNC recovery. In all products, red cell reduction was above 95% and overall volume reduction was approximately 91%. The final incompatible RBC volume infused in all products was within our institution specific guidelines. 3 patients exhibited adverse events at infusion. 2 patients had reported hypertension and 1 exhibited fever within 24 hours of infusion. Conclusion: The Spectra Optia BMP platform provides a safe, effective and consistent method for processing ABO incompatible bone marrow products. The Automated Interface Management (AIM) system allows for less operator variability while ensuring optimal cell recovery. In the pediatric population, this method has resulted in products with more manageable volumes at infusion, incompatible RBC volumes well below what is allowable, and excellent cell recovery. Patients tolerated infusions with few adverse events, and smaller infusion volumes are more easily managed by nursing staff. Background/Case Studies: Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with major ABO incompatibility have an increased risk for delayed red blood cell (RBC) engraftment and prolonged RBC transfusion dependence. In these patients, the evaluation and reporting of the serologic ABO discrepancy between the forward typing (FT) and the reverse typing (RT) may clarify the status of RBC engraftment. The goal of this study was to compare the ABO FT and RT discrepancies in patients with major ABO incompatible HSCT, using two different serologic techniques and to correlate these with transfusion rate. Study Design/Method: We reviewed and compared FT and RT ABO serologic typing results and RBC transfusion needs, on 32 blood samples drawn from patients (n=7) with major ABO incompatible HSCT at either <100 days or \u2265 100 days post-transplant, using either automated gel (GT) versus manual tube (MT) methods. RT was performed using MT at immediate spin (n=32) or with an additional 15 min room temperature incubation (n=12). Data evaluated included: HSCT donor ABO FT and RT strength of reaction (graded w + to 4+) and number of RBC units transfused within 2 weeks prior to ABO typing. Differences in FT and RT grading was determined by GT grade minus MT grade. Groups were compared using student t-test. Results/Finding: The samples (n=32) were drawn at 63 \u00b1 20 days (<100 days, n=16) and at 149 \u00b1 55 days (\u2265100 days, n=16) post transplantation. At < 100 days and \u2265100 post-transplant, no significant difference was observed in the reactivity of HSCT donor ABO FT for when using Gel compared to MT methods. Differences were observed in the reactivity of the RT for either anti A or anti B against HSCT donor in 5/32 samples (16%) with a stronger reaction using the MT method (-1.2 \u00b1 0.45) (p>0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the detection (either w+, 1+, or 2 + ) of anti HSCT donor ABO in the samples [8/12 (83%)] tested with the MT method with a 15 minute incubation, compared to no reactivity detected by the gel method (p=0.001). At < 100 days, the transfusion rate was at 81% with a mean of 1 ABSTRACT 77A cellular therapies are developed from the patient's own cells, allogeneic cellular therapies may also be an option for patients. Allogeneic cellular therapies require that a healthy donor be willing and able to provide the starting material in order to produce the final cellular therapy, and consistency in donor experience and collections is critical for both cellular therapy manufacturers and the donors themselves. Utilizing extensive experience in cell sourcing, donor management, and cell collection, donors from a volunteer registry have been contacted and consented to provide starting material for research, clinical and/or commercial use, with strong emphasis on providing a positive donation experience for volunteer donors. Study Design/Method: Since 2016, volunteer donors have been contacted and consented to donate a mononuclear cell product collected by apheresis (MNC(A)) for therapies other than allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This effort has resulted in over 100 MNC(A) collections thus far. In order to donate this MNC(A) product, consented donors were asked to complete multiple phone calls as well as in-person appointments prior to collection in order to assess for medical fitness to donate, as well as to determine eligibility status. For these purposes, it was mandatory that donors meet the eligibility requirements of both the domestic regulatory agency and certain international regulatory agencies. For those donors that proceeded to collection, in the weeks following their donation, donors were sent an electronic satisfaction survey for completion. Donors were asked to rate their satisfaction with the donation process in thirteen key metric areas ranging from flexible scheduling to education materials, and explanation of risks to feeling appreciated and cared for. Results/Finding: Nearly 71% of the donors who donated MNC(A) from October through December 2017 completed the post-donation survey. Of these responses, the \"Performance to Goal\" was \"Met or Exceeded\" 100% of the time in all areas. On a 5-point scale, the average overall donor satisfaction experience was rated 4.73.",

Immune status of recipients may influence the effect of blood transfusion, and guidelines to blood transfusion in this condition have been discussed a lot. In fact, Clinicians in China do not give blood transfusion to patients with body temperature above 38\u00b0C mainly caused by inflammation except in urgent situation. Researchers have demonstrated viral mimic polyinosinic polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)], a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule induce robust antibody production in a mouse model of blood transfusion and it has been reported viral disorders demonstrated a trend towards increased risks in RBC alloimmunization in a human study. Here we investigated if transfusion to mice with simulated bacterial infection could boost stronger immune response and its underlying mechanism. Study Design/Method: We injected mice with both Gram-positive bacteria mimic lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and Gram-negative bacteria mimic lipopolysaccharide( LPS) and then transfused mice with human red blood cells to induce antibodies, as an simulated experimental system to study the effect of infection on RBC immunization. Mice were divided into a normal control group, a human RBC transfused positive control group receiving human RBC intravenously, an experimental group receiving LPS (3mg/kg) four hours before human RBC transfusion, an experimental group receiving LTA (5mg/kg) four hours before human RBC transfusion. Assessment of RBC immunization was performed by measuring serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) against human RBC weekly for two weeks. And the lymphocyte changes in spleen are also monitored by flow cytometry. Background/Case Studies: The success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is related to HLA matching in unrelated donor-recipient transplantation. At present, the HLA-DPB1 genotyping has not been included in the routine test for donor selection. Studies have shown that HLA-DPB1 mismatch can increase the risk of GVHD, and HLA-DPB1 match can reduce the overall risk of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study will retrospectively analyze the association between HLA-DPB1 matching and short tandem repeats(STR) results in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Study Design/Method: 106 individuals(53 pairs of unrelated donorrecipient) who underwent unrelated allogeneic HSCT with a 10/10 HLA allele matched donor in Zhejiang province were collected in this retrospective analysis. The genotyping of HLA-DPB1 for all the samples was performed by PCR-SBT method according to the previous report. The correlation between the HLA-DPB1 matching and short tandem repeats(STR) results for 106 samples (53 pairs of unrelated donor-recipient) after transplantation was analyzed. 13 STR loci and 1 sexual locus were detected for every donor and recipient by GeneScan method with the commercial PowerPlex Fusion system. All the results of STR were collected more than three times including one month,three months and six months after transplantation. Results/Finding: Of 53 donor-recipient pairs in our study, the STR results of 46 recipients showed successful hematopoietic stem cell implantation without relapse, the remaining 7 recipients showed a chimeric status. To study the association between HLA-DPB1 matching and STR results, implemented group and chimeric group were divided into three subgroups according to the result of HLA-DPB1 genotyping, shown in Table 1 . The HLA-DPB1 matching has no effect on the status of hematopoietic stem cell implantation according to the results of Chi-square test (P>0.05).",

In conclusion every cord blood bank should continue to strive to maximize the volume of cord blood collection and process it within a short a time frame as possible to ensure the highest quality cell product possible for its institution and/or clients. Background/Case Studies: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a complex procedure which requires optimal coordination between the clinical transplant service and the apheresis and processing teams. Infusion of the cryopreserved product necessitates optimal quality control to ensure stable engraftment of the cryopreserved CD34 + stem cells. Mobilization varies considerably among patients, especially patients with underlying hematological disease with extensive prior therapy. The current paradigm posits that 5 \u00d7 10*6 CD34 + cells per kilogram of recipient weight ensures engraftment of the ablated marrow. While this represents a calculated surplus of pluripotent stem cells homing to the marrow, there are many variables which may impact collection and quality of the final product. Our empirical observations postulated that there was an inverse correlation between the yield of CD34 + cells and subsequent post-thaw viability of the cells in the cryopreserved product. Study Design/Method: In order to evaluate the possible inverse correlation, data was gathered from autologous stem cell collections from 2014-2015, and parameters for each collection were tabulated. Data was parsed to ensure a standard apheresis protocol with respect to technique and collection parameters. We then evaluated the relationship between post-thaw viability and the CD 34 + cell yield of the collection procedures by linear regression trendline analysis. Results/Finding: Data from 51 sequential HPC collections incorporating yields from 24 autologous stem cell transplant candidates was tabulated.",

However, many other variables deserve focused analysis to further improve the quality of mobilized peripheral hematopoietic stem cell yield. Background/Case Studies: Acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) leads to high morbidity and mortality after trauma, which is manifested by prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), decreased platelet function and clot firmness, and increased fibrinolytic activity. The myxoma virus protein Serp-1 is a member of serine protease inhibitor superfamily. Serp-1 has been shown to inhibit fibrinolytic serum proteases including plasmin, tissue/or urokinase plasminogen activator (tPA, uPA), as well as exert anti-inflammatory activity in various animal models. In this study, Serp-1 was administered in a preclinical ATC-model using a rat with polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock. We hypothesize that Serp-1 can improve the outcome of ATC. Study Design/Method: Isoflurane anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent polytrauma within 20 minutes followed by 40% hemorrhage. All rats were resuscitated (50% of shed volume) with fresh whole blood (FWB) from anesthetized donor rats at 60min after trauma. Serp-1 (1mg/kg, n=9) or vehicle (n=5) was given intravenously prior to trauma. PT was measured at baseline, 0, 45 and 120min after trauma. Lung wet/dry weight was measured at the end of experiment. Additionally, the whole blood from healthy human donors (n=9) was treated with Serp-1 (0.01mg/ml) to determine the direct effect of Serp-1 on hemostasis by rotational thromboelastogram; and on platelet function by impedance aggregometer (using adenosine diphosphate, protease-activated receptor-1, collagen, and U46619). Results/Finding: Serp-1 prior to trauma, modestly delayed the rise of PT immediately after trauma (0min), but not at 45 and 120min after trauma as compared to vehicle (percent change of PT to baseline at 0, 45 and 120min after trauma, Serp-1: -2.6 \u00b1 1.0, 4.5 \u00b1 1.1, 6.2 \u00b1 1.5%, and Vehicle: 2.7 \u00b1 1.0, 7.1 \u00b1 1.4, 8.7 \u00b1 1.3%). Limited resuscitation of FWB led to a significant rise in the wet/dry weight ratio of the lung, which was significantly attenuated by Serp-1 treatment (Serp-1: 5.27 \u00b1 0.07 vs. Vehicle: 5.59 \u00b1 0.07, p<0.05). Invitro, Serp-1 significantly decreased clotting time (Serp-1: 45.2 \u00b1 2.1 vs. vehicle: 50.3 \u00b1 2.5, p<0.05) and increased maximum clot firmness (Serp-1: 55.8 \u00b1 1.6 vs. vehicle: 52.2 \u00b1 1.6, p<0.05), but had no effect on platelet aggregation stimulated by any agonists. Conclusion: Serp-1 can directly potentiate the clot formation as measured by in-vitro assessment. Administration of Serp-1 in rats with ATC delays development of ATC by temporarily attenuation of PT elevation immediately after trauma. Serp-1 may also reduce acute lung injury in trauma through anti-inflammatory activity and attenuation of vascular permeability in addition to attenuation of trauma induced coagulopathy. This preliminary study suggests a potential benefit of using Serp-1 in severe trauma, and further investigation for optimal dosing and timing strategy is indicated.",

Respondent demographics and ordering practice are reported in Table 1 . The most common user-reported indications for VT orders included trauma, cardiovascular (CV) and gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. However, the most common indications in the QIDB were CV, GI, and postpartum hemorrhage. Half (36/72) of respondents who ordered or interpreted VT reported ordering at least once to investigate the possibility of hyperfibrinolysis. A minority of respondents (8/72;11%) reported ordering VT in a non-bleeding patient, most commonly for a pre-procedure baseline in coagulopathic patients. When deciding to treat a bleeding patient for whom VT was ordered, 38% of respondents wait for results of VT, 57% treat based on most recent standard labs available and use VT to confirm decisions, and the remainder base treatment decisions on clinical stability and severity of bleeding. In the QIDB, 18% (18/102) of VT were repeated to ensure that the defect improved after intervention; whereas, 33% (24/72) of respondents reported that they almost always order repeat VT. The mean score\u00b1SD for the competency assessment was 3.9 \u00b1 1.2 out of 5 questions (78.4%). Respondents performed best on the low fibrinogen and hyperfibrinolysis case scenarios. Providers that repeatedly order VT in clinical practice were more likely to pass the competency assessment (p=0.001). Background/Case Studies: Coagulopathic bleeding is a serious complication of cardiac surgery. A key contributor is acquired hypofibrinogenaemia (plasma fibrinogen < 1.5-2.0 g/L), the standard treatment for which is cryoprecipitate. Purified fibrinogen concentrate is also used, but few comparative data exist and randomised trials are needed. The primary objective of the FIBrinogen REplenishment in Surgery (FIBRES) study is to demonstrate that a new fibrinogen concentrate (Octafibrin/Fibryga, Octapharma) is noninferior to cryoprecipitate. Study Design/Method: This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, active-control, randomised (1:1), single-blinded, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in adult cardiac surgical patients with clinically significant bleeding due to acquired hypofibrinogenaemia. Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for whom fibrinogen supplementation is ordered within 24 hours will be randomised to receive 4 g fibrinogen concentrate or 10 units cryoprecipitate (dose equivalent). Research personnel obtaining outcome assessments will be blinded to treatment allocation. All randomised patients will receive fibrinogen supplementation according to clinical need. Patient consent at randomisation is waived, with written informed consent obtained as soon as possible therafter. Primary outcome is combined red cell, platelet and plasma transfusions within 24 hours of CPB. Secondary outcomes include blood products used within 7 days, major bleeding within 24 hours, fibrinogen levels and adverse events. Enrolment of 1,200 patients will provide > 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority, based on a 20% non-inferiority margin, \u2265 550 patients/group and $10% drop-out rate. Safety reviews by the DSMB will be performed every 100 patients. An interim analysis will be performed at 600 patients with pre-specified stopping rules for futility and overwhelming efficacy. The pragmatic design and treatment algorithm align with standard practice, aiding adherence and generalizability.",

Patients received 1 (73%) or 2 (27%) RBC units during the transfusion episode. Between baseline and one-week Hgb measurements, 38 of 208 subjects (18%) received 1-3 additional RBC units as part of patient care, and these subjects were included in the 1 week increment assessment. Mean change in Hgb was 0.6 g/dl/unit (SD \u00b1 0.5) at 30 minutes and 0.9 g/dl/unit (SD \u00b1 0.8) at one week. Hgb increment at 30 minutes decreased with larger patient blood volume (Nadler) and higher patient baseline Hgb, but increased with the RBC component volume transfused. Hgb change at one week increased with change in Hgb at 30 minutes, decreased with subject blood volume (Nadler), and was lower in patients hospitalized between Hgb measurements. Subject age, gender, non-RBC volume transfused, total RBC dose (1 week analysis only), and chemotherapy use (\u00b1 4 weeks from the study transfusion) were eliminated during backward elimination. Conclusion: In this cohort, most patients had a Hgb increment of less than1 g/dl/unit after Tx. Two recipient-specific factors influenced the Hgb increment at 30 minutes, and patient disease status was associated with the Hgb response after one week. While other donor-or unit-specific factors not captured in this study may also impact Hgb increment, our data suggest that pre-Tx recipient factors can help predict Hgb-response post-Tx. Providers should account for recipient circulating blood volume and pre-transfusion Hgb in addition to the expected increment per RBC unit to achieve Tx goals. Background/Case Studies: Platelet morphology and activation is believed to be important to the success of prophylactic platelet transfusion in thrombocytopenic patients. Developed in 1974, the Kunicki Morphology Score (KMS) evaluates the quality of platelets as they undergo morphological transformation due to conditions such as storage temperature and aging. A higher percentage of non-discoid platelets is believed to predict poor platelet recovery and survival after transfusion. In recent years, flow cytometry has emerged as the preferred tool for the quantification of platelet activation and surface marker-protein expression. P-selectin (CD62P) is a putative platelet activation marker. In this study, we have attempted to find the correlation between KMS and P-selectin expression in stored platelets and explore the possibility of using KMS as a cost-effective alternative to flow cytometry for platelet activation quantification. Study Design/Method: Apheresis platelets (AP) were collected (n=3 donors) in BCSI\u00ae 15 ml mini platelet storage bags at either 22\u02daC with agitation (RT) or 4\u02daC without agitation (4C). Samples were assessed on Day 0, 1, and 3 of storage for KMS using phase contrast microscopy. One hundred free floating, non-adherent platelets were assigned arbitrary grades based on their morphology KMS was calculated as the sum of all grades, with superior morphology (100% discs) equal to 400. To assess surface P-selectin expression (%), AP were stained with anti-CD62P antibody and analyzed on a FACS Canto I. Data were reported as means \u00b1SEM. KMS and P-selectin expression data were analyzed for Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) using two-way ANOVA and with significance set at P<0.05. Results/Finding: High KMS was observed for Day 0 platelets (332 \u00b1 9). Platelet morphology was highly preserved under RT storage conditions and similar KMSs on subsequent days (Day 1: 265 \u00b1 29 and Day 3: 276 \u00b1 23). Platelets stored at 4C had increased amoeboid morphology and decreased KMSs (Day 1: 138 \u00b1 13 and Day 3: 126 \u00b1 5). RT samples showed a marginal increase in P-selection expression (Day 0: 12 \u00b1 2%, Day 1: 15 \u00b1 3%, and Day 3: 22 \u00b1 3%) whereas a significant increase was observed in 4C samples (Day 1: 47 \u00b1 1% and Day 3: 61 \u00b1 4%). KMS and P-selectin expression had a strong negative correlation (r = -0.878, P < 0.001). As expected, the percentage of non-discoid morphology displayed a strong positive correlation with P-selectin expression (r = 0.877, P < 0.001).",

In addition, the thromboembolic events (if documented by primary teams) post 4F-PCC infusions were subsequently evaluated by both authors to determine the potential contributions of 4F-PCC. Notably, five patients died within one week of their bleeds/4F-PCC administration, four due to irreversible brain damage associated with the initial intracranial bleeding, and one due to inoperable GI bleeding. We did not find any thromboembolic events within 24 hours of 4F-PCC administration. However, four patients (4/25 = 16%) had thromboembolic events 2-45 days after receiving 4F-PCC including stroke, myocardial infarct, atrial thrombi and non-occlusive IJ tube thrombi. Conclusion: Our data showed that 4F-PCC was relatively efficient in aiding the 'reversal' of DOACs for patients with severe hemorrhage. We did notice that 16% of patients experienced some form of thromboembolic events in the days-to-weeks after 4F-PCC administration, although the imputability of 4F-PCC in these processes (versus their underlying disease) is difficult to parse out. Additional, prospective studies would be warranted to further evaluate the safety of 4F-PCC for this off-label indication. Background/Case Studies: Supratherapeutic INR and major bleeding secondary to warfarin therapy occurs in approximately 4 % of the patients on chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrilation. Available treatment options for reversal of anticoagulation include withholding warfarin, administering oral or intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). The use of PCC is now recommended for severe bleeds by several organizations and their respective consensus guidelines, including the ACCP. The Transfusion Service Laboratory at 1000 + bed health system recently recognized \"warfarin reversal\" as the transfusion indication for 20.1% of all plasma transfusions occurring in 2015. Furthermore, 85% of all plasma orders were for 1 or 2 units while the recommended dosing of plasma is 10-15ml/kg (3 to 5 units for most adults). A retrospective analysis of all plasma transfusions indicated only 49% of the orders were deemed \"appropriate\" and warfarin reversal accounted for 37% of all \"inappropriate\" orders. As such, a multidisciplinary team was assembled to address inappropriate use of plasma within this health system. Study Design/Method: The team evaluated current practice, examined available literature, reviewed and standardized transfusion guidelines, indications and related policies as well as provided education to key stakeholder groups. Internal anticoagulation reversal guidelines were updated to recommend use of PPCs for any emergent reversal of warfarin; while recommending use of vitamin K for all other patients. \"Warfarin reversal\" was removed as a transfusion indication for ordering plasma. In addition, weight-based clinical decision tools were created and incorporated into the electronic medical records which calculate a recommended quantity of plasma based on a predefined algorithm. During a six month period following all interventions, individual providers received timely feedback regarding inappropriate use of plasma. Results/Finding: In the six months immediately following the educational efforts, the percentage of plasma orders deemed \"not appropriate\" due to warfarin reversal decreased by 57% (from 37% to 16%). The number of 1 and 2 unit plasma orders decreased by 45%. The review also indicated many providers had modified the number of plasma units recommended by the clinical decision support tool; suggesting need for further intervention. Conclusion: Internal review of plasma utilization of a 1000 + bed health system identified concerns with ordering indication as well as dosing. Provider education and timely feedback appear to have positively impacted appropriate use of plasma transfusion. Further provider education will likely be needed to reinforce the message and further influence plasma dosing practice.",

However, platelet count alone is a poor predictor of bleeding.For adequate hemostasis the formation and sustainability of a stable clot are essential. Bleeding events in CIT patients with similar platelet counts might be influenced by changes in clot lysis potential in these patients. We hypothesized that bleeding risks in CIT with similar platelet counts might be influenced by changes in clot lysis potential. We investigated clot strength and susceptibility to tPA induced clot lysis as measured by tPA-ROTEM, an in-house designed whole blood rotational thromboelastometry assay, designed to assess clot firmness and stability. Study Design/Method: tPA-ROTEM results in CIT were compared with results in healthy individuals. tPA-ROTEM parameters wereclotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), \u03b1-angle (\u03b1), maximum clot firmness (MCF), LOT, LT and delta LS. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify independent determinants of the tPA-ROTEM outcome variables, including fibrinogen, FII, FVII, FXIII, plasminogen, a2-AP, tPA, PAI-1, TAFI, hemoglobin, platelet and leucocyte count. Also, tPA-ROTEM results in CIT before, 1 hour and 24 hours post-platelet transfusion were compared. Results/Finding: 72 consecutive CIT patients and 40 healthy individuals were included; 57 patients with 1 hour posttransfusion, and 45 with 24 hours posttransfusion results. CIT patients had low PAI-1 and TAFI levels, but expressed high FVIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, VWF activity. Compared to healthy individuals, CT and CFT were significantly longer and MCF was significantly lower in CIT. LOT and LT were shorter in CIT patients. The delta LS in %/min was not significantly different. Combined LOT/LT results showed hyperfibrinolysis before platelet transfusion in 39% of patients had. Delta lysis speed was normal in most patients (94%). In multivariate analysis a higher plasminogen level was significantly associated with a shorter LOT/LT; higher leukocytes, PAI-1, a2AP, FXIII and FII were significantly associated with a prolonged LOT/LT. Higher fibrinogen was associated with decreased lysis speed. 62 patients received 65 platelet transfusions.1 hour post-transfusion, CFT was significantly shorter and MCF significantly higher, as compared to pre-transfusion values. Although a significant increase of CFT and decrease of MCF was noticed post-24 hours, both outcomes were still improved as compared to pre-transfusion. LOT/LT significantly prolonged 1 hour and 24 hours posttransfusion. LOT/LT results post-platelet transfusion indicated a 50% reduction of the number of patients with hyperfibrinolysis. Conclusion: tPA-ROTEM outcomes and determinants were in agreement with the expected changes associated with hyperfibrinolysis. CIT patients had slower clot formation and formed weaker clots, which were less resistant to fibrinolysis. A significant proportion of CIT patients had hyperfibrinolysis according to LOT/LT values. Platelet transfusions significantly improved resistance to fibrinolysis, especially 1 hour post-platelet transfusion. In most patients tPA ROTEM changed from a hyperfibrinolytic profile to a less hyperfibrinolytic or normal profile after platelet transfusion.",

The application of adult coagulation standards may affect abnormal clotting assessment in neonatal patients. The premise for managing clotting in newborns is to understand the normal clotting intervals of newborns. Accurate determination of coagulation anomalies will be conducive to more efficient treatments. Compared with adults, TEG has been reported less frequently in pediatrics, especially in neonatology, and even less in pathologic neonates. The establishment of TEG parameter intervals for healthy people at different ages is conducive to an expansion of TEG applications. Study Design/Method: To test the range of normal neonatal thromboelastography (TEG) values in the Chinese population and evaluate the coagulation status of newborns from pathologic pregnancies.

The clot reaction time (R) value was 4.24 \u00b1 1.22 min, which is lower than adults. The clot kinetics (K) value was 2.25 \u00b1 1.05 min, which was the same as adults. The angle value was 61.89 \u00b1 9.18\u00b0, which was similar to adults. The maximum amplitude (MA) value was 50.48 \u00b1 4.75 mm, which was equivalent to the lower limit of adults. The coagulation index (CI) value was \u22120.52 \u00b1 2.15, which was comparable to adults. Neonatal TEG parameters in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pregnancy-induced anemia were not significantly different from normal neonates. There were statistical TEG differences in the R, K, and angle values between newborns of diabetic gravidas and newborn of healthy gravidas. There were statistical TEG differences in the R and angle values in premature neonates.",

            "text": "The neonatal TEG parameters have different intervals than adults, and the analysis results are also different from those of traditional coagulation tests, which need to be re-investigated. Background/Case Studies: The coagulopathy of trauma has been extensively studied over the last few decades. The value of viscoelastometry in guiding management of these patients have been well documented. Notably, studies about coagulopathy in burn patients are scarce. Several studies have shown that burn patients are hypercoaguable. However, most of these studies were done using samples collected after patient resuscitations or upon admission to the ICU. Additionally, although burn patients typically have normal to slightly elevated platelets, the platelet function has been questioned in several studies. Study Design/Method: We conducted a prospective observational study of burn patients (\u226518 years) presenting to our level 1 trauma center. TEGs were ordered by the burn team on various patients and were not done as part of the study. Citrated samples were collected at patient presentation. Whole blood aggregation studies were performed immediately. The remaining samples were processed immediately and the plasma was kept frozen at -80 o C until testing. Additional samples were collected at days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Samples will be studied for microparticle number and identity, microRNA, cytokine/chemokine concentration, and coagulation factor (FVIII, FIX, FX, FV, FVII, PS, PC, von Willebrand factor antigen and activity) values. Results/Finding: To date, 41 patients have been enrolled in this study, which is still ongoing. The majority of patients had thermal burns caused by flame exposure. The mean ( \u00b1 SD) age of patients was 47 \u00b1 16 (range 20-87 years) and 70.6% were male. The mean total body surface area burn (TBSA) was 9.7 \u00b1 9.5 % (range 0.3-38.3%). The mean number of RBCs transfused was 0.6 (range 0-20 units). No patients received plasma or platelet transfusions and none died. Most TEG tracings were normal or had shortened R times. The mean platelet counts were within our reference range at all time points ( Figure 1 ). Most patients had abnormal whole blood aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid. This was very obvious even in patients with as little as 1% TBSA burn. No patients with abnormal platelet activity were on any platelet inhibitor therapy. Conclusion: The reason for this decreased platelet activity is unclear and further studies are ongoing. One theory is that the platelets may degranulate as a response to the acute phase reaction. This may produce higher percentage of platelet microparticles, which contribute to the hypercoaguable state that has been observed by others and by our TEG studies.",

Pathogen reduction is a method of sterilizing blood products resulting in decreased pathogen load. Previous studies have demonstrated alterations to coagulation factor levels in pathogen reduced cryoprecipitate (PR-cryo), but assessments of procoagulant microparticle (MP) activity after pathogen reduction are scarce in cryoprecipitate. The purpose of this study was to compare MP prothrombinase activity in samples of whole-blood (WB) and apheresis-derived (APH) cryoprecipitate with and without pathogen reduction. Study Design/Method: In this IRB-exempt study, donor plasma from group A donors was pooled and split to produce six identical APH and six identical WB cryoprecipitate units. PR treatment was performed on three APH and three WB units according to manufacturer recommendations with amotosalen and UVA light. The remaining three APH and three WB units served as non-PR-cryo controls. Procoagulant MP activity was assessed using a functional prothrombinase assay according to manufacturer instructions. Levels of thrombin were reported as phosphatidylserine (PS) equivalents. Comparisons between PR and non-PR-cryo groups were performed using independent samples t-test with significant results declared at p<0.05. Results/Finding: A significant decrease in prothrombinase activity was noted in WB PR-cryo compared to WB non-PR-cryo, but no significant difference was measured between APH PR and non-PR-cryo (Table 1) . Conclusion: Findings in this small study suggest that pathogen reduction may decrease prothrombinase activity in cryoprecipitate. This could potentially be explained by the sequestration of MPs by the amotosalen adsorption device during pathogen reduction. Further quantitative thrombin generation assays and functional assessments with thromboelastometry to evaluate the hemostatic equivalence of PR-cryo are warranted.",

            "text": "Results/Finding: Case 1 : A 45 year old S/\u03b2 sickle cell patient died 10 hours after liver transplantation indicated for haemochromatosis hepatic cirrhosis (Child & Pugh = 2). Diabetes and cardiac involvement with major iron overload in T2* and no signs of ventricular hypertrophy at the EKG (59% systolic ejection fraction with a major relaxation disorder) were associated diseases. Deferroxamine and deferasirox were introduced several times but stopped for side effects. Deferriprone was well tolerated but introduced too late. The patient died from post-surgery intractable hemorrhage and cardiogenic shock during vascular filling. She previously had a Grade 2 TACO at D-41 and a Grade 1 at D-28, which only risk factors were diastolic heart failure related to hemosiderosis. Case 2 : A 88 years old chronically transfused myelodysplasia patient received 47 Packed Red Cells (PRC) during 6 years, was referred to hospital for impaired general condition with fever. Upon arrival, her Hb was 7.8 g/ dL. A CT-scan showed hepatosplenomegaly. Two PRC were transfused slowly. Seven hours after completion, she experienced dyspnea with arterial desaturation, hypertension (180/70), bilateral crackles and increased BNP (2,747 pg/mL). IV furosemide and Isosorbide dinitrate were immediately administered, but the patient died of congestive heart and multiple organ failure. Because of the discrepancy between the severity of heart failure and any known cardiac history, a serum ferritin assay was retrospectively performed that showed a level >5,000 ng/mL. Conclusion: Cardiac hemochromatosis is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmia and at the late stage by dilated cardiomyopathy. In a retrospective study among 98 consecutive TACO cases, 13 (29.5%) had an ejection fraction < 50% whereas 24 (54.5%) showed evidence of diastolic dysfunction (Lieberman L et al). By analogy with Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury, we propose a two-hit model in which the red blood cells transfusion could be responsible for the first step by causing heart iron overload and consequently a diastolic dysfunction, and the second step by transfusing a fluid volume that remains intravascular. This hypothesis could result in considering iron chelation as a preventive measure to prevent TACO in chronically transfused patients. Background/Case Studies: It is widely accepted that point of care whole blood coagulation test devices are useful to detect coagulopathies with real time manner in massively bleeding situation such as major cardiac surgery. However, its implementation is still limited in Japan because of their costs and lack of public insurance supports. Study Design/Method: Fifty consecutive cases of elective cardiac surgeries with cardiopulmonary bypass were analyzed in this study. Blood samples were collected at three points, i.e. before surgery, just after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass and protamine administration, and after surgery, respectively. Laboratory data were measured by two point of care devices, TEG6s and Sonoclot, and routine coagulation /blood count tests, in all 150 collected blood samples from 50 cases. The data obtained by point of care devices were not provided to the clinicians, and consequently not to be used to determine transfusion indication on each case. First, we evaluated linear correlation of each laboratory examination's data by Pearson's test. Next, theoretical total blood loss was calculated by hemoglobin contents. Total amount of perioperative RBC transfusion was also recorded, and thorough clinical data were collected on each patient from the electronic records. We finally tried to establish a multi-variate linear regression model to predict perioperative bleeding and RBC transfusion amounts by measured laboratory data and collected clinical parameters. Results/Finding: In 50 cases included in this study, 40 cases received any type of transfusion, i.e., 39 cases of RBC transfusion (39%), 37 cases of plasma transfusion (37%), and 21 cases of platelet transfusion (42%), respectively. Average amount of RBC transfusion was 7.3 Japanese units ABSTRACT (approximately 3.3 US units). Measured parameters of TEG6s/Sonoclot, routine laboratory platelet counts, and fibrinogen value were strongly correlated each other. On the contrary, ACT value of routine coagulation test was not correlated with TEG6s and Sonoclot parameters. In multi-variate regression analysis, we failed to establish a rational and comprehensive linear regression model. Although operation time and ACT value at termination of cardiopulmonary bypass were strongly associated with perioperative bleeding and amount of RBC transfusion, extracted explanatory variables of Sonoclot/TEG6s paradoxically exhibited inverse correlation to bleeding tendency on platelet/coagulation functions, suggesting hidden confounding factors in this study population and the limitation of the study design. As only significant point of care test explanatory variable, Sonoclot PF value at termination of cardiopulmonary bypass was correlated to platelet transfusion volume as well as operation time and preoperative platelet count. Conclusion: ACT value at termination of cardiopulmonary bypass can be a useful predictor of perioperative bleeding of major cardiac surgery. Although Sonoclot/TEG6s measurement parameters may be used as independent parameters to conventional ACT test, further intervention studies will be required to determine its usefulness in major cardiac surgery on the Japanese population.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Hyperkalemia is a rare life-threatening complication of RBC transfusion. Stored RBCs leak intracellular potassium (K) due to an inhibition of the membrane ATP pump and gamma irradiation potentiates the K leak further. RBC transfusions administered slowly have been shown to have little effect on serum K concentrations, however, massive and rapid transfusions may cause temporal hyperkalemia, especially when the patient's total blood volume is small and the serum K in the transfused product is high. While there are many case reports, the occurrence of transfusion associated hyperkalemia (TAH) and characteristics of patients and implicated blood products have not been studied systematically. A multi-institutional study of TAH was conducted through the AABB Pediatric Subcommittee, and the data from two facilities is reported here. Study Design/Method: For the study period of 9/1/2015-8/31/2016, medical records of patients aged <18 years old who had K levels above reference range within 12 hours after or during a RBC transfusion were reviewed for patient demographics, medical history and co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment for hyperkalemia, as well as the age, volume, and modifications of transfused RBC units. Results/Finding: Total 2,085 patients received total 11,586 RBC transfusions. Hyperkalemia within 12 hours after or during the RBC transfusion was found in 14 patients (0.67%) who received 41 RBC transfusions (42% irradiated). Median K increase from previous K level before the hyperkalemia was 1.6 mmol/L. Patient's median age and weight at the time of transfusion was 0.2 years old and 4.9 Kg respectively. All patients had serious comorbidities including prematurity in 5 patients, cardiac dysfunction in 8, renal disease in 4, sepsis in 3 and brain lesions in 2 patients. High volume of RBCs was used for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 4 patients, which was not associated with mortality. Mortality occurred in 4 patients within 3 days of hyperkalemia occurrence. Among them, 3 patients had decreased follow-up K after hyperkalemia occurrence (2 were treated for hyperkalemia), and 1 patient (0.05%) died soon after hyperkalemia was noted during the transfusion. This patient was transfused 55% of patient's estimated total blood volume with irradiated RBCs within 3 hours before the hyperkalemia occurrence. Overall, 14 patients received median 77% of estimated total blood volume within 12 hours before hyperkalemia occurrence and median age of RBC units transfused was 13.0 days old. Conclusion: Fourteen patients (0.67%) experienced hyperkalemia within 12 hours after or during RBC transfusions and 1 patient had hyperkalemia at the time of death possibly attributable to RBC transfusion. Patient's median age and weight at the time of hyperkalemia with transfusion were 0.2 years old and 4.9 Kg respectively. Cardiac dysfunction was the most common risk factor for possible TAH, and prematurity, renal dysfunction and ECMO associated massive RBC transfusion were also associated with higher risk of TAH.

            "text": "Perioperative Background/Case Studies: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an inexpensive and widely available anti-fibrinolytic agent known to reduce red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in cardiac surgery and selected orthopedic surgeries. While its use in cardiac surgery is routine, its use and effectiveness in non-cardiac surgeries with comparable rates of bleeding and transfusion are uncertain. The objective of this study is to evaluate TXA utilization patterns in non-cardiac surgeries at high risk for transfusion. Study Design/Method: To accurately characterize TXA use in non-cardiac surgeries at high risk of perioperative RBC transfusion, we completed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate all patients ( \u2265 18 years of age) undergoing non-cardiac surgery at five hospitals in two cities between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016. We identified non-cardiac procedures at high risk for transfusion using the standardized Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) procedure codes contained within the hospital Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). We linked the DAD with transfusion databases and laboratory databases to obtain supplementary transfusion and laboratory data. To evaluate contemporary TXA utilization patterns in the identified cohort of highrisk procedures, we performed a chart review (n=2000 charts) and database query. We described the proportion of patients who received intraoperative TXA. We also described details of TXA dosing. Results/Finding: In 5 cities, we identified 95 non-cardiac open surgeries associated with a transfusion rate \u22655%. In this cohort, tranexamic acid was used in 13.3% of surgeries (range 0% to 83%). TXA usage was highest in orthopedic and spine surgeries, including total hip arthroplasty (75%), femur osteotomy (74%), pelvic osteoplasty/osteotomy (56%), vertebrectomy (48%) and vertebral fusion (45%). When we excluded orthopedic and spine surgeries, TXA use was limited to 2% of open surgeries. The mean time from the operation start time to TXA administration was 97 minutes (77 minutes). TXA was administered as a bolus in 91%, and as an infusion in 28%. The mean TXA dose was 940 mg ( \u00b1 239 mg). Conclusion: Tranexamic acid is routinely used in cardiac, orthopedic and spine surgery, yet utilization in other surgical domains at high risk for perioperative red blood cell transfusion remains low. Each year, greater than 30,000 deaths and 65,000 injuries are attributed to firearms in the United States however transfusion requirements for these patients are not well understood. In this study, we sought to determine how blood utilization and mortality differs between victims of gun violence versus victims of non-gun related trauma for patients requiring transfusion at a level-1 trauma center in an urban setting. We also assessed the cost of transfusion in these patients. Study Design/Method: The State Trauma Registry was reviewed for all trauma patients who presented to a tertiary care facility from January 2005 to June 2017. The study population was limited to patients who received any blood product during their hospital course. Patients were categorized based on mechanism of injury: 1) gunshot wound (GSW) or 2) all other trauma (non-GSW), and the number and type of all blood products were assessed. The primary outcomes were mortality, blood utilization, and the cost of transfusionwith costs assessed by two methods: 1) blood acquisition costs, and 2) activity-based costs (total cost of transfusion including overhead). Results/Finding: Data are shown in the table. The GSW patients were younger, more likely to be male, and had a higher injury severity score. Among the 1,336 trauma patients requiring blood product administration, 538 were victims of gun violence (40.3%). Mortality in the Emergency Department (ED) was \u22486 times higher, and overall mortality was \u22482.5 times higher in the GSW cohort compared to the non-GSW cohort. GSW patients requiring transfusion demonstrated an approximate 13% ED mortality and a 33.5% overall mortality. GSW patients received on average \u22482 times the amount of blood products per patient compared to non-GSW patients (including PRBCs, FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate). For the 540 transfused GSW patients, \u2248$6 million went to activity-based transfusion costs. The average transfusion cost per patient was \u22482 times higher in GSW victims versus non-GSW trauma patients.",

Though the transfused population was admitted with lower Hgb levels, discharge Hgb levels were lower in both study and control groups. Higher Hgb levels in the control group possibly mitigated the need for transfusion intervention. Also, an undetermined anemia classification was identified in the highest frequency for both study populations. These data may relate to diagnostic phlebotomy and iatrogenic anemia within the transfused population. Many patients received only 1 unit of RBCs (average volume 320 mL) during the admission which corresponds to the average total blood loss. Based on transfusion trigger data and guidelines at this facility, clinicians are not unnecessarily transfusing patients in the MICU patient population. A total of 28 stable, non-refractory hemato-oncology patients were enrolled in the study after fulfillment of inclusion criteria. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee. Patients received apheresis platelets as low dose (1.5X10 11 platelets /unit), medium dose (3x10 11 platelets/unit) and high dose (>4X10 11 platelets/unit) at different time points in a sequence of standard, low and high dose as and when a request was received based on his/her pre transfusion platelet count and clinical profile. The post transfusion counts were assessed after 20-24 hours of transfusion and post transfusion response indicators were calculated in terms of platelet increment, corrected count increment (CCI), percent platelet recovery (PPR). Transfusion free interval and the bleeding events were also recorded for different doses.",

Post transfusion increments were comparable with standard (22318.18 \u00b1 12159) and high dose (22636.3 \u00b1 18062), however CCI (p=0.006) and PPR (p=0.008) were better with standard dose and were statistically significant. Higher post transfusion increments were observed with high dose as compared to low dose, however CCI (p=0.04) and PPR (p=0.05) were better with low dose and were statistically significant. The transfusion free interval after the standard dose, low dose and high dose was 3.71 \u00b1 3.4 days, 3.36 \u00b1 4.4 days and 7.24 \u00b1 7.9 days respectively, however,the difference was not statistically significant. Donor exposure to patients was significantly (p=0.000) reduced to 17.5% owing to the splitting of platelet products to form customized doses for the transfusion Conclusion: Standard dose of apheresis platelets is the best choice for adequate post transfusion response in hemato-oncology patients however, the possibility of low dose as an alternative to standard can be considered in stable thrombocytopenic patients owing to the comparable post transfusion response indicators (CCI and %PPR) in the two groups",

Due to the significant variability in response to transfusion in the transfusion dependent patient, blood is usually ordered empirically rather than to achieve a specific goal for Hgb or transfusion schedule. In these patients both the dose of red cells transfused and the degree of red cell production influence how long a given transfusion may keep a specific patient above a desired target Hgb. An individualized model to guide transfusion could improve the precision of ordering and reduce unnecessary visits as well as units transfused.

The calculator pulls information from the electronic medical record to calculate transfusion half-lives for up to 6 prior transfusions. These half-lives are used predict the response to future transfusion given the patient's current Hgb and weight. Options are then presented to the ordering provider to select a transfusion dose, in units, which determines a follow-up time over which the patient is expected to stay at or above the selected target Hgb. We performed a prospective pilot of the HEME BUC in patients with transfusion dependent anemia with the primary outcome being the percentage of patients that return as scheduled with a Hgb at or above (within 0.5g/dL) the selected target in an intent to treat fashion. Results/Finding: Over nine months, 148 transfusions were ordered using the HEME BUC of which 117 had complete data for analysis. A target Hgb of 8 was selected in 80% of cases. Forty-five percent of transfusions were single unit and 55% were two units, which represents a significant increase in single unit transfusions from historic orders. The mean predicted time to return after transfusion was 10.5 days and 75% of patients had follow-up within 3 days of the selected BUC return time. Overall, in 91% of transfusions, patients returned with a Hgb at or above target. Conclusion: The HEME-BUC provides flexible and individualized transfusion recommendations in transfusion dependent patients using an adaptive mathematic algorithm that learns from each patient's personal experience with RBC transfusion. Within the options presented by the HEM-BUC, over 90% of patients remain at or above the target hemoglobin selected by the ordering provider. Further studies to expand the role of such adaptive/learning decision support technologies are ongoing.",

Conclusion: Women with HUB commonly have iron deficiency anemia, therefore it is important to assess iron body stores on these patients and if appropriate, initiate the most adequate treatment. It is also important to establish good inter-department communication between the different medical specialties that will provide the assessment, follow-up and treatment to this particular subset of the populationa well-established protocol between the Gynecology/Obstetrics department and the ImmunoHemotherapy DayCare Hospital is essential to a better management of anemia in these patients and to facilitate the referral procedures and reduce the time until proper treatment. Intravenous iron is a safe and effective therapy, with quick replenishment of body iron stores and correction of anemia with few administrations and is therefore the therapeutic of choice in this particular clinical entity. PBM programs have facilitated the interdisciplinary management of anemia while reducing blood transfusions whether in medical settings as well as perioperative settings and should continue to be implemented. Background/Case Studies: Patient Blood Management (PBM) principles are highly applicable to surgical practices. An ideal PBM approach is multifaceted, multi-modal, and multidisciplinary in design, implementation, and execution. The goal of this investigation was to assess changes in transfusion behaviors before and after implementation of a robust PBM program at a large tertiary care surgical center. Study Design/Method: This is a single center observational study of PBM implementation for a large and diverse surgical practice from 2012 through 2017. Formal multidisciplinary PBM efforts were initiated early in 2014. This consisted of multiple simultaneous interventions, including education (presentations and online training modules), standardization of transfusion guidelines, and electronic clinical decision support (CDS) rules for transfusion ordering, advanced transfusion analytics, and provider specific transfusion reports. Transfusion data derived from 2012 and 2013 were used as baseline information. The majority of the PBM efforts were initiated in early 2014 with the subsequent years comprising the post-implementation cohort. Outcomes included annual blood product transfusion totals and percentages. For surgical patients receiving at least one unit of allogeneic RBCs the frequency and percentage of patients discharged from the hospital with hemoglobin values > 10 g/dL was also assessed. Results/Finding: A total of 293,139 surgical patient admissions were included, with the annual surgical volume increasing by 8.8% from 2012 to 2017 (46,785 to 51,310; p < 0.05). The percentage of surgical patients transfused with one or more units of allogeneic RBCs decreased from 11.2% to 7.7% over the study period (p < 0.05). The percentage of patients receiving plasma decreased from 3.7% to 2.5%(p < 0.05), with relative stability in platelets (2.8% to 2.7%), and cryoprecipitate (1.0% to 1.3%) utilization. For the patients receiving RBCs, the number of patients discharged with hemoglobin values >10 g/dL decreased by more than 40% (21.1% to 11.9%; p<0.05) Conclusion: PBM implementation efforts for a large surgical practice were associated with substantial reductions in RBC and plasma transfusions, with minimal effect on the utilization of platelets and cryoprecipitate. Additionally, patients receiving RBCs were more likely to be discharged with hemoglobin values < 10 g/dL, suggesting increased tolerance of postoperative anemia. Further efforts are underway to assess relationships between changes in transfusion patterns and patient centered outcomes. Background/Case Studies: The transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is essential for hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HCT). The risk of transfusion reactions (TR) and the cost of blood has led to efforts to reduce blood use. Patient blood management (PBM) recommendations include transfusing 1 rather than 2 units when RBC are needed. We changed our inpatient practice to transfuse just 1 instead of 2 units of red blood cells (RBC) when HCT patient's hemoglobin < 8g/dl. Our hypothesis is that this would reduce RBC utilization. We describe the impact of this change on RBC utilization, prevalence of transfusion reactions, and nursing staff workflow. Study Design/Method: We included patients > 18 years who received an allogeneic HCT between 7/1/2015 -6/30/2017. On 7/1/2016 we changed our practice to transfuse 1 instead of 2 units of red blood cells (RBC) when the hemoglobin was < 8g/dL. We compared RBC utilization in patients receiving allogeneic HCT in the 12 months before (control arm) and after implementation of this new practice (intervention arm). We used regression models to estimate the independent effect of transfusion practice (1 vs. 2 units/episode), length of hospitalization, the conditioning regimen, and donor type for patients who received at least 1 RBC unit. The outcome variable was total number of inpatient transfusions. In addition, a survey assessed the impact of this. Results/Finding: 176 patients were included in this analysis (100 in control group; 76 in the intervention arm). Cohorts were matched for age, primary diagnosis, graft source and conditioning regimen. The median number of RBC units transfused/patient was identical in both arms (4. Interquartile range 1-9 units/patient). The mean number of RBC transfusions were 7.2 vs 6.1; however, this difference was attributable to a few highly transfused patients. Using the regression model, only length of stay (relative increase of 1.035 units/day; 95%CI, 1.027-1.044) was an independent predictor of the number of RBC units a patient received. When data were normalized/1000 patient days, the control arm received 230 units vs the intervention arm, which received 195 units, resulting in a reduction of 35 units transfused/1000-patient-days. There were 0.07 TR/patient (standard deviation [SD]: 0.29) for the control arm vs 0.05 reactions/patient SD: 0.23) in the intervention arm. The survey of RNs showed that 39 (78%) felt that it positively affected the workflow, 10 (22%) were neutral, and 1 RN felt it had an adverse impact. Conclusion: We found no significant difference in the median number of RBC units transfused and the number of transfusion reactions per patient, as compared to historical controls. There was a modest reduction in RBC utilization based on units transfused/1000-patient-days. In addition, there was a positive impact on RN workflow.",

While some clinical guidelines have been developed for blood component use over the past decade, the practical impact of these guidelines is uncertain. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of whole blood and blood component transfusion in the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative from 2010 to 2017. Study Design/Method: We used electronic health records and health claims databases from the BEST Initiative, a Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Sentinel Program component. Three data partners participated and provided records for approximately 27 million patients. Transfusion events were captured using medical billing and reimbursement data, including the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification -Ninth or Tenth Revision (ICD9-CM or ICD10-CM), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes. These codes were further categorized to identify transfusion events for whole blood, red blood cells (RBC), platelets, and plasma. An event was defined as occurrence of component specific codes per person regardless of the number of units transfused. Results/Finding: Table 1 shows transfusion of whole blood and blood components from 2010 to 2017. Of the 390,168 total transfusion events in this period, RBC comprised most of transfused components (n=269,402; 69%) with platelets, plasma, and whole blood accounting for 91,130 (23%), 26,164 (6.7%), and 3,472 (0.9%), respectively. Over this period, overall transfusion events and that of whole blood decreased. The transfusion of plasma and platelets slightly fluctuated whereas RBC transfusions had a slight increase in 2011 but showed a decline from 2012 to 2017. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that medical billing and reimbursement data in medical records capture blood transfusions and provide additional capability for the CBER hemovigilance system. We observed an overall decline in whole blood and RBC transfusions between 2010 and 2017 in the Sentinel BEST Initiative. Hemovigilance activities, including whole blood and blood component utilization trends, can inform and encourage implementation of transfusion guidelines for managing blood resources in the United States.",

Clark 1 . 1 University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, 2 Univeristy of Tennessee Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Computerized provider order entry alerts (CPOE) with clinical decision support can reduce inappropriate transfusion. The goal is to determine if the alerts truly decrease inappropriate transfusion or just delay red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. The goal is to determine effectiveness of CPOE alert system in lowering RBC transfusion rates and determine what patient populations are receiving additional RBC units after the alert. Study Design/Method: Retrospective 6-month data of CPOE alerts aimed at restrictive strategy and promoting 1-unit transfusion ordering practice for RBC transfusion are collected (June 1 through November 30, 2016). Alerts fire based on specific criteria in an effort to avoid alert fatigue in providers. Transfusions are reviewed for appropriateness based upon 2012 AABB RBC transfusion guidelines. Patient population consists of inpatients, and excludes intraoperative transfusion, massive transfusion, and outpatient transfusions. Patients receiving additional units within 48 hours after the alert are reviewed for appropriateness, hemoglobin levels pre-and post-transfusion, demographics, listed indication for transfusion, and clinical scenario. Results/Finding: After initial 2-unit order, alert fired 226 times. Initial 2-unit order was cancelled 24 times, changed to 1-unit 151 times, and continued 51 times. Of the patients receiving 1 unit, 42 patients received additional RBC units and 109 patients did not receive additional RBC units within 48 hours of the initial alert. With CPOE alerts, 157 RBC units were saved during this 6-month period, resulting in product acquisition cost savings of nearly $27,000. The alerts resulted in a 35% reduction of number of RBC units transfused in this population. The clinical setting in the additional unit population included: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed (39%), sepsis (22%), surgical patient (14.5%), oncology diagnosis (9.6%), non-GI active bleeding (7.3%), trauma (4.9%), and other (2.4%). All final initial 1-unit orders met AABB guidelines, while only 5% (2 of 42) of the additional units did not meet criteria. The average age of patients receiving additional units is 55 years-old (15-92) with male to female ratio of 1.4:1. Conclusion: CPOE alert system with clinical decision support is effective in reducing inappropriate RBC transfusion. The most common setting for additional transfusion was GI bleeding (39%) in which there was continued blood loss. The vast majority of patients receiving RBC units following the alert had clinical situations meeting guidelines. Therefore, the alerts are effective in promoting restrictive transfusion strategy and 1-unit RBC orders without delay in transfusion needs. Background/Case Studies: Plasma is routinely transfused for non-evidence-based indications, exposing patients to risks including transfusionassociated circulatory overload, alloimmunization, and hemolytic transfusion reactions. Clinical orders for plasma transfusion at our academic medical institution occur through a computer provider order entry system (CPOE) that filters the patient's most recent labs through evidence based and institution-chosen transfusion guidelines. Orders not meeting guidelines trigger a request for further information. Providers choose indications from pre-populated, pull-down menus (e.g. \"DIC with INR > 1.5\") and/or add a comment. The laboratory data, selected indication, and comment are collected for retrospective review. Study Design/Method: Plasma override orders from January 2016 to December 2017 were reviewed to determine prefixed indication, most recent INR, free-text comment and the attending service/department. Each order was assigned one of the following codes: I-Indicated, NI-Not Indicated (based on institutional and AABB guidelines), NMI-Need More Information, P-Protocol and NIC-Non Indication Comments. Free-text comments were each assigned a code, tabulated, and analyzed. The most common words in free text indications included \"bleed\", \"bleeding\" or \"hemorrhage\" (315 times), \"INR\" (140 times), and \"transplant\" (45 times Background/Case Studies: Anemia is a deficiency in the total amount of red blood cells (RBC) or hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations that affects the oxygen carrying capacity. It is prevalent in up to 50% of all hospitalized patients. The appropriate treatment varies based on etiology, with iron deficiency being the most common cause. Anemia is an independent risk factor for hospitalization, readmission, prolonged length of stay, diminished quality of life, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. This newly developed laboratory anemia panel provides more efficient assessment and anemia screening through one simplified order algorithm. Study Design/Method: A reflexive algorithmic anemia panel was established in our lab on June 2017. Medical records of 57 adult patients screened for anemia using this reflexive panel were retrospectively reviewed over an 11 months period. Patient characteristics and treatment modalities were collected along with clinical and laboratory data including iron studies. Results/Finding: A total of 44 (77%) patients were found to be anemic with the most common diagnosis being iron deficiency anemia (n=32, 73%). Significant improvement in the post treatment Hgb was observed when compared to the screening Hgb (10.5 \u00b1 2 vs. 8.6 \u00b1 1.5; p<0.0001). Similar improvements were also detected in MCV and RDW indicating improved RBC and Hgb production (Table) . The average treatment duration was 206 +29 days. Oral iron replacement therapy was the most common intervention (n=23, 52%). Two patients were treated with IV iron and one patient was treated with folic acid. No significant reactions or complications were reported.",

Patients in our study cohort showed significant increase in Hgb indicating successful management and follow up of anemia. Background/Case Studies: Despite acknowledged benefits of Patient Blood Management (PBM), implementing effective programs remains challenging especially for multi-hospital healthcare systems serving multiple states. A large healthcare system with 45 hospitals in 14 states, on a total of 12 electronic medical record platforms, with an initial system-wide blood acquisition expenditure blood spend of $18M annually, formed an interdisciplinary partnership to expedite a comprehensive PBM program in less than a year. Study Design/Method: An implementation plan was developed to support first year goals: establishing a PBM infrastructure, developing state of the science transfusion guidelines and order sets, disseminating education, and providing system and provider level data. The team developed a prioritization matrix formula consisting of hospital size, data availability, and transfusion volumes to guide efficient workflow. Strong emphasis was placed on each phase to maximize behavioral modification effects. A system level PBM Steering Committee formed individual PBM task forces throughout 25 hospitals to carry out the strategic plan. All in-scope hospitals implemented guidelines and CPOE blood order sets. The committee launched an awareness campaign across all hospitals and delivered CME /CE educational programs at the largest hospitals. Transfusion data reports were developed for the hospitals utilizing one of the system's largest information technology platforms (n=12 sites). Key performance indicators (see below) form the basis for evaluating the program. Results/Finding: Over a 7-month period, through process-driven and aggressive oversight, RBC utilization declined $13% for the system overall, despite a 3% patient volume increase. There was an $16% decrease in transfusion volume at the 12 sites for which data reports were implemented. Overall, RBC transfusions at hemoglobin (Hgb) > 8g/dL declined 5%, RBC transfusion at Hgb <7g/dL increased by 7% and single unit orders increased 12% during the first 6 months. The healthcare organization's blood acquisition costs declined $2.3M; $/average patient day fell to $8.48 during 2017 vs. $9.81 in baseline year 2016 (14.3%). Conclusion: Creating a comprehensive PBM program in an expansive healthcare structure requires innovative strategies to successfully scale key programmatic components. Direct and regular access to key decision makers along with streamlined decision-making processes, provider education, CPOE, and data and analytics were key drivers for success. Findings show a significant reduction in red blood cell utilization is possible across a large system over a one-year time frame Background/Case Studies: Allergic transfusion reactions are the most common adverse reaction to blood products. There is a wide range of severity of reactions but they are usually mild, occur within 2 hours of transfusion, and present as cutaneous manifestations such as localized urticarial lesion and pruritus. The presumed mechanism is mast cell degranulation and histamine release. Diphenhydramine, an inverse agonist of histamine H1 receptor, is the most commonly used medication to alleviate symptoms. It has not been proven to prevent allergic reactions although it is recommended as a premedication in patients with history of allergy to blood transfusion. Study Design/Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis through our blood bank software, HCLL\u2122 Transfusion (Mediware, Lenexa, KS), to find all cases accessioned for reaction workup and narrowed it to allergic reactions from June 2010 to August 2017. Then, we reviewed pathologist interpretation reports for each reaction. Our outcomes were categorized according to implicated blood products, volume transfused (partial/incomplete, complete), premedication and post-medication, attempted repeat transfusion within 48 hours of reporting a reaction, and severity (severe, non-severe/mild . For analysis purposes, the total number was rounded to 164. Mild allergic reactions were reported in 77% of cases while severe reactions were seen in 23%. The majority of mild reactions, 39%, were associated with RBC while the majority of severe reactions, 50% (19/38), were associated with platelets. There was no premedication in 83% of mild reactions but there was post-medication in 80% of cases. Incomplete transfusion was seen in 63% of all cases of which 72% were associated with red blood cells. Thirty three percent of patients with mild reactions had incomplete/partial transfusions and were transfused again within 48 hours of the reaction. This represents 16% of all allergic reactions.",

Background/Case Studies: Alloimmunization to human red cell antigens plays an important role in the management of patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Our pediatric center supports a large population of SCD patients, including many on chronic transfusion protocols, and, in order to reduce the risk of alloimmunization, we have, since 2002, selected our red cell donors so as to match their Rh (C, E) and Kell (K) phenotype to that of the recipient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the state of alloimmunization in this patient population to assess the benefit of this approach. Study Design/Method: For 34 chronically transfused patients, every donor unit transfused was traced back through patient electronic records and compared to the donor antigen profile on record at the blood collection facility using methods developed by an independent data analysis group. We reviewed each patient's transfusion history, which was comprised of a median range of 96.5 months of transfusion data, and determined how often a mismatch resulted in the formation of alloantibodies. To compare the alloimmunization state of our patients with that of a reference population, studied prior to the adoption of C, E and K matching (Castro2002-https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12147019), we generated the allo-antigen distributions for both populations.",

Thus, while the allo-antibody distribution in the population studied by Castro and colleagues extends to as many as 9 antibodies per patient, ours is limited to at most 3. Nevertheless, 32.4% (=11/34) patients, having received dozens of transfusions, made at least one allo-antibody, including antibodies to Js(a) (3/11 = 27.2%), Fy(a) (18.2%), V (18.2%), Kp(a) (10%) and e (1/11), along with C (4/11) and E (3/11).

            "text": "Conclusion: The data obtained from our patient cohort is consistent with the prediction of Castro and colleagues, and the conclusions of subsequent studies (e.g. Shafi2014 -https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628032), namely that an overall reduction in sensitization is possible by carefully selecting donors whose antigen profile matches that of the recipient. The implementation of novel algorithm for selecting donor units over a large set of antigens, with quantitative consideration of the immunogenicities of individual antigenic determinants, we believe will achieve further improvement in the prevention of alloimmunization. Background/Case Studies: Maximum surgical blood ordering schedules (MSBOS) were first described in the 1970s to provide some guidance for surgeons about how much blood should be ordered in the pre-op phase. The goal was to cut down on unnecessary type and cross orders and to make sure an appropriate quantity of blood was available for surgeries likely to require transfusion. This concept, the recent emphasis on patient blood management, and newer surgical techniques have all contributed to a decreased utilization of blood products and unnecessary crossmatches. One unintended consequence to these policies might be an underutilization of type and screens. Most operations do not require blood transfusions routinely. Yet if an unexpected complication arises during an operation, the lack of a type and screen can have negative consequences if emergency release blood is needed. Study Design/Method: We evaluated all scheduled operations at our institution over a 4 week period. For each procedure we identified if the patient had a type and screen on file within 3 days of the operation (within 14 days for cardiac procedures). The results were compared to published MSBOS guidelines that recommended which procedures should have a type and screen. Results/Finding: A total of 1622 scheduled procedures were identified with type and screens on file for 317 (20%). On average there were 81.1 procedures a day with 16 type and screens ordered. All of the urology, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal surgeries that had a type and screen recommended by a published MSBOS had a 100% type and screen rate at our institution. Other procedures that were recommended to have a type and screen had varying rates of compliance including open hysterectomies (25%), ovarian surgery (5%), spinal fusions (57%), laminectomies (33%), hip replacement (92%), knee replacement (31%), open shoulder (25%) and neck dissections (17%). There were inconsistencies amongst different surgeons in the frequency of ordering a type and screen for the same procedure and also inconsistencies for the same surgeon on different days. Conclusion: Many of our surgeons are able to complete most of their operations with minimal blood loss and little need for transfusions, but many procedures are also being performed without a type and screen on file. While most of these procedures have no need of blood, orthopedic, gynecologic and ENT surgeries all have potential for high blood loss due to unexpected complications or unusual anatomy. If the patient already has an alloantibody that was unidentified, emergency release O negative blood could lead to hemolytic transfusion reactions. The inter-surgeon and intra-surgeon variability across the hospital demonstrates a lack of a unified approach to the utilization of type and screens and shows that the push to decrease overutilization of blood products has possibly swung the pendulum towards underutilization.",

            "text": "Nurses Study Design/Method: The study adopted a qualitative research approach and employed the direct application of knowledge to change the understanding and influence the thinking and behavior of nurses toward transfusions. Purposeful sampling of 10 nurses selected based on the inclusion criteria that nurses have no previous knowledge about PBM and be working in a clinical area where blood products are administered. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with follow-up questions via email, if needed. Results/Finding: Themes generated from data analysis revealed an increase in knowledge (10/10) related to associated risk factors and adverse reactions of blood transfusions; competence (8/10) conveyed in performing expertly and acting independently; confidence (7/10) voiced in becoming inquisitive, making decisions, and educating colleagues; and motivation (4/10) to spreading knowledge and educating other nurses and providers. All participants initiated action plans to share their knowledge, spread awareness, and provide support to their clinical units through exploiting presentations, learning modules, in-services, and creating reference pages for PBM. Feeling empowerment was mutual among 8 participants who were enthusiastic to inform others about risks associated with transfusions, ensure safe and appropriate use of blood products, and encourage patients to make educated decisions on transfusions. Only 2 participants reported empowered, but not to the extent of challenging the inappropriate ordering of blood products. Background/Case Studies: Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a procedure used to remove pathologic substances in the plasma. However, the procedure also depletes plasma coagulation factors, which can lead to major bleeding. The goal of this study was to evaluate performance of a mathematical model for predicting post-procedure coagulation factor levels in a cohort of hospitalized patients. A smartphone app based on the model was created for determining how much plasma replacement is needed to achieve a target post-TPE factor level. Study Design/Method: Our model utilizes patient weight, pre-TPE hematocrit and pre-TPE coagulation factor levels, as well as the volumes of plasma processed and plasma replaced. Model accuracy was assessed by comparing predicted versus measured post-TPE fibrinogen and antithrombin levels for 49 inpatient TPE procedures occurring at a large academic medical center between 2013 and 2017. Upon model validation, a smartphone app was developed for iOS and Android devices. Results/Finding: Minor adverse events occurred for 25% of patients, all of which resolved spontaneously or with management. No bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred. The mean difference between predicted and measured post-TPE fibrinogen concentrations was 4.3 mg/dL (SD \u00b1 23.1, range: -66 to 44), while percent difference between measured and predicted fibrinogen concentration was 3.10% (SD \u00b1 12.8, range of -29 to 30). The mean difference between predicted and measured post-TPE antithrombin concentrations was 3.4% activity (SD \u00b1 9.4, range -18 to 33), while mean percent difference between predicted and measured antithrombin percent activity was 3.75% (SD \u00b1 13.1,range -25 to 36). Conclusion: Our model reliably predicts post-TPE fibrinogen and antithrombin concentrations within 25% of the measured value. When maintenance of critical factor levels is essential, clinicians should consider targeting coagulation factors 20-25% higher than projections. The app, Plexfactor, greatly simplifies calculation of plasma replacement needed to achieve a target post-TPE factor level.

Treatment group patients were underwent a single volume therapeutic PE. All the patients had two or more fold increase of at least two anti-heart antibodies (AHA) level (to cardiac nuclear antigens, endothelial, cardiomyocytes, conduction and smooth muscle cells antigens) and underwent endomyocardial biopsy (EMB, n=17), cardiac CT (n=38), MRI (n=21), myocardial perfusion scan (n=39), and coronary angiography (n=20) to diagnose myocarditis. All the patients were treated either with immunosuppression drugs or without them. Echocardiographic parameters and AHA level detection were assessed at baseline and with two follow-up (FU) visits in about 6 and 12 month in both groups. We also evaluated a 6minute walk test (6MWT) were classified as responders vs. 6 (32%) responders in the control group. Responders in the study group were characterized by initial higher systolic PAP (44 \u00b1 13.4 vs. 27.9 \u00b1 6.0, p<0.05). Six (43%) treatment group patients and 17 (89%) control group patients got methylprednisolone (p<0.05). The mean dose was 11.8 \u00b1 6.6 and 21 \u00b1 12.4 mg per day respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion: PE improves cardiac function and daily activities in patients with iDCM. There were 50% study group responders.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a disorder of heme synthesis caused by an abnormality in the terminal enzyme ferrochelatase. Protoporphyirin (PPIX) accumulates within red cells and deposits in the skin and liver manifesting as photosensitivity and less commonly liver disease. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) corrects the enzymatic abnormality, but patients may also require orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). In the post-OLT period multiple therapies have been employed to reduce plasma PPIX levels, such as simple transfusion and hemin infusion which reduce PPIX production. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and red blood cell exchange (RBCx) have been shown to transiently improve laboratory values and histologic findings but fail to prevent progression of liver disease. As such, the 7th edition of the American Society for Apheresis guidelines categorized EPP as a category III indication for apheresis. We herein present a pediatric patient with EPP who underwent OLT as a bridge to SCT and was managed with simple transfusion, TPE, and RBCx. Study Design/Method: We present a 17-year-old male with EPP and recurrent hepatic porphyria crises. The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, transaminitis, and anemia (hemoglobin 8.9 mg/dL, hematocrit 27%). He was started on hemin (Panhematin; Recordati Rare Diseases Inc, Lebanon Brunswick, New Jersey) and daily TPE while undergoing evaluation for OLT. After OLT, he was started on RBCx every 3 weeks and underwent a total of 12 RBCx procedures. TPE was gradually weaned from daily to once a week with a total of 47 TPE procedures performed. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin threshold was raised to 9 mg/dL to suppress erythropoiesis. Results/Finding: In the 10 months following OLT, the patient's mean hemoglobin and hematocrit were 8.6 mg/dL and 27%. The patient continued to have elevated PPIX (mean=1105.8, normal < 20 \u03bcg/dL) and total plasma porphyrin (mean=1180.1, normal < 80 \u03bcg/dL) with associated diffuse axonal polyneuropathy. He additionally continued to have elevated liver enzymes and post-transplant liver biopsies showed increasing iron deposition, mixed inflammation, and increased fibrosis. The patient also developed hypogammaglobulinemia associated with chronic TPE. The patient was ultimately transferred due to the high acuity of care and is preparing for HSCT. Conclusion: TPE and RBCx are often employed in the management of EPP patients despite being an ASFA category III indication. In our experience PPIX and total porphyrins remained elevated and the patient had continued liver injury. Chronic red cell transfusion maintaining a hematocrit of >39% has been shown to improve symptoms in a patient with congenital erythropoietic porphyria by suppressing erythropoiesis; however, our patient was not transfused to that level. Interest has waned in hypertransfusion with patients being successfully managed by hemin infusions, which have a lower iron burden, though this treatment was also inadequate in our patient.",

She had received a total of 625 mg of rATG as induction therapy for her transplant. At presentation, she had severe joint tenderness, upper and lower extremity swelling and proximal, bilateral upper extremity paresis. She had been ambulating normally the evening prior to admission. Imaging of the brain and spinal cord was unremarkable. Hypercoagulability and other causes of neuropathy were ruled out. Her complement levels were low. The patient had undergone a course of TPE early in her posttransplant course for suspected antibody-mediated rejection, which was later excluded. She had no prior exposure to rabbits. However, her past medical history was significant for exposure to rATG during a prior renal transplant. She had no past history of serum sickness. Due to the severity of her symptoms and lack of response to corticosteroids, plasma exchange using albumin replacement was initiated. Following the procedure, the patient noticed an impressive reduction in pain. The next day her rash waned, swelling had subsided and she regained upper extremity function. She was able to ambulate with a walker at the point of discharge, a week later. No additional apheresis treatments were performed. Conclusion: Early plasma exchange is highly effective at reversing the symptoms of serum sickness, especially in patients with rapidly progressive neuropathy, weakness and severe pain, who are refractory to corticosteroids. Current apheresis guidelines do not list SS as an indication for TPE.

In spite of this, the antibody screen became positive in an anti-D+C pattern during her 3 rd pregnancy, which unfortunately ended in an intrauterine fetal demise at 26 weeks. She then presented to our institution for prenatal care for her 4 th pregnancy at 6 weeks 6 days gestation. Her husband is homozygous D/D. Study Design/Method: Reference lab testing revealed the presence of anti-D, anti-G, and anti-E antibodies, and was negative for anti-C. The anti-D+G titer was 1:4,000 and the anti-E titer was 1:2,000 initially (see table 1 ). At 11 weeks and 0 days the patient underwent a three day course of plasmapheresis. On her third day of plasmapheresis, she also had IVIG administration. Weekly antibody titers were followed clinically, and the patient was managed with weekly IVIG administration until intrauterine transfusion (IUT) was possible. At 22 weeks 7 days gestation the patient underwent IUT for middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity greater than 1.5 MoM by Doppler ultrasonography. She had a total of 5 IUTs, every 3-4 weeks, until delivery ( supplementation. Serious side effects such as anaphylaxis are very rare. In such cases, unfractionated heparin (UFH) can serve as an anticoagulant during apheresis; however, no guideline for stand-alone UFH dosing during apheresis is available. We report on a patient who developed anaphylaxis to ACD-A during plasmapheresis; we successfully used UFH as a standalone anticoagulant. Study Design/Method: A 55-year-old man with chronic kidney disease caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis presented to the nephrology clinic for his third kidney transplantation. The first and second transplantations had been performed at the ages of 25 and 34 years. The only available kidney donor was his wife, who was blood-group incompatible. The patient's blood type was A + ; his wife's was B + . After admission, plasmapheresis was commenced to deplete anti-ABO antibodies (a preconditioning protocol). A 1.0-volume plasma exchange featuring ACD-A anticoagulation with Spectra Optia (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA) was planned every other day. The replacement fluid was AB + fresh frozen plasma (FFP). During the first plasmapheresis session, the patient developed generalized itching. About 10 min after commencement of the second session, he developed urticaria, followed by dyspnea, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. Plasmapheresis was stopped immediately, and intravenous dexamethasone and chlorpheniramine maleate were administered; the symptoms disappeared in about 1 h. Thereafter, skin prick and intradermal citrate tests yielded strongly positive results. We thus used UFH as a standalone anticoagulant during plasmapheresis, eliminating ACD-A. The replacement fluid was changed from FFP to albumin because FFP contains citrate. When UFH was infused continuously during plasmapheresis, the whole blood:UFH ratio was held at 1:28. A 1.5-volume plasma exchange was performed during every plasmapheresis session. Results/Finding: We successfully performed five plasmapheresis sessions using UFH as the sole anticoagulant. Two sessions were scheduled preoperatively (to deplete anti-ABO antibodies) and three postoperatively (to remove class II anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies). The patient underwent successful kidney transplantation and maintains good graft function at 3 months of follow-up. Conclusion: When a patient develops an allergic reaction to citrate during plasmapheresis, UFH can be used safely as a stand-alone anticoagulant. Background/Case Studies: Therapeutic phlebotomy (TP) is the standard treatment for patients with blood disorders resulting in excess red cell production. A Double Red Blood Cell (dRBC) procedure offers an alternative to therapeutic phlebotomy. This option is potentially a more efficient means of depleting excessive red cells than TP. A sixty-eight-year-old male presented to our hospital's emergency room with altered mental status and stroke-like symptoms. The patient's past medical history was notable for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible hemochromatosis. On physical examination, he was confused, tachycardic, and plethoric. Initial laboratory results showed an elevated hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) at 19.6 g/dL and 54.8% respectively. His other laboratory results such as white blood cell (10.27 \u00d7 10 9 ) and platelet count (150 \u00d7 10 3 ) were within the normal range. Study Design/Method: We performed an emergent, back-to-back dRBC procedures on the patient given his rapid clinical deterioration. We monitored the patient's CBCs through the course of the dRBC procedure (Table 1) . Results/Finding: After the completion of two consecutive dRBC procedures, the patient's total Hgb and Hct levels decreased by 27.6% and 25.3% respectively. The first dRBC collection was 22 minutes in duration with removal of 345 mL of red blood cells (RBCs). The second dRBC collection was 21 minutes with an additional removal of 456 mL of RBCs. Albumin was administered during the procedure as a replacement fluid instead of isotonic saline to maintain appropriate intravascular oncotic pressure. No adverse events were noted during both procedures and the patient tolerated them without any difficulty. Conclusion: Utilization of an automated double red cell collection allowed for a donor apheresis instrument to be used therapeutically in treating a Background/Case Studies: Patients who undergo a series of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) often receive steroids as part of treatment for the underlying disorder. When using 5% albumin as replacement fluid, fibrinogen is often followed to assess the need for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as part of replacement fluid. As steroids can affect many laboratory parameters, we hypothesized that use of steroids may affect fibrinogen levels during TPE series. This study evaluated whether steroid use during a series of TPE predicted the need to use FFP as part of replacement fluid due to hypofibrinogenemia. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients at our academic medical center from 01/2017-03/2018 who underwent a TPE series with 5% albumin as initial replacement fluid. Patients with diagnoses for which FFP was indicated as replacement fluid were excluded. Indication for TPE, concurrent use of oral or intravenous steroids, trend in fibrinogen, and whether FFP was ever used as replacement fluid due to hypofibrinogenemia were noted. Statistical analysis was performed using Background/Case Studies: Bacterial contamination of recovered tissue allografts poses a serious threat to transplant recipients. Antibiotic disinfection is a standard practice utilized in cardiac valve (CV) allograft treatment in an effort to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination, however the composition of the antibiotic cocktail as well as incubation conditions can vary widely depending on the tissue bank. Changes to antibiotic availability and recent revisions to Canadian health standards have resulted in a requirement for further quantitative validation of tissue allograft bioburden reduction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the revised antibiotic cocktail on intentionally contaminated CV allografts, in order to quantitate bioburden reduction and define the optimal incubation temperature for the disinfection process. Study Design/Method: Disinfection solution, composed of vancomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL), tobramycin (80 \u03bcg/mL), and cefoxitin (240 \u03bcg/mL) in RPMI and was inoculated with 10 5 CFU/mL of five challenge organisms considered medically significant in tissue banking at 4\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C. Following 24 hours of incubation, the remaining CFUs were counted and log reduction was calculated. To further evaluate the appropriateness of a disinfection incubation range of 24 hours \u00b1 2 hours, four CVs were bisected and inoculated with 10 6 CFU of challenge organisms before being placed in the disinfection solution. At each time point one half of the allograft was removed and washed in Lactated Ringer's solution before recovering the remaining bacteria in sterile saline by sonication and mechanical shaking. The final recovery solution was filtered and quantified for bacterial growth. Results/Finding: Recovery efficiency of the sonicated CV allografts was higher for aerobically vs. anaerobically cultured microorganism (61.89 % vs. 47.65 %). Maximal inhibitory dilution (MID) of the updated antibiotic cocktail utilized throughout the validation study demonstrated that the working concentration of antibiotics was more than sufficient to inhibit growth of all five challenge microorganisms. The most sensitive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes which were both inhibited at a dilution of 1/128, followed by Escherichia coli (1/32), Clostridium sporogenes (1/16) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1/8). In the absence of antibiotics, challenge organism growth at 4\u02daC remained relatively stationary (0.09-log \u00b1 0.09 and 0.30-log\u00b10.06 for aerobic and anaerobic cultures respectively). Incubation with antibiotics at this temperature resulted in a 1log reduction in growth (-1.09 (\u00b10.07) aerobic and -1.18 (\u00b10.11) anaerobic). When the incubation temperature is increased to 21\u02daC there is greater than 2-log increase in bacterial growth after 24 hours (2.64 \u00b1 0.07 aerobic and 2.51 \u00b1 0.25 anaerobic), but the the bioburden reduction was increased to over 4-log at this incubation temperature (-4.11log\u00b10 .05 for aerobic and -4.10log\u00b10.15 for anaerobic).",

            "text": "Conclusion: This study demonstrates cardiac valves are optimally decontaminated in the proposed disinfection solution cocktail when the incubation temperature was increased from 4\u02daC to 21\u02daC. The disinfection protocol was shown to reduce bacterial bioburden by greater than 4-log for both aerobic and anaerobic challenge organisms. Background/Case Studies: MMA is a test used to predict the clinical significance of alloantibodies. It is most often used to assess antibodies directed at high prevalence antigens, however, it may also be used to assess common antibody specificities to find blood for patients with difficultto-find antigen requirements. MMA results greater than 3% reactivity result in a transfusion recommendation for antigen negative blood; the negative reference range for the MMA in our laboratory is 0-3%. Study Design/Method: In 2011, MMA data was presented. In this review, the data are updated and the previous data was incorporated using results from 1995 through 2017. The assays were performed as previously described (Transfusion 1987; 27:449-452) . Testing was performed with fresh complement (C') and without fresh complement (NC') added to the test system. Results/Finding: The following table contains MMA results for 402 serum samples tested. Some of these antibodies have been reported to have varying degrees of significance. Others were tested because there were insufficient blood products available to support transfusion needs. Conclusion: Anti-Yt a continues to be the most tested specificity, with 119 of 195 samples yielding positive results (61%). Of the common specificities tested, one example of anti-s demonstrated reactivity below the cut-off while 3 of 11 examples of anti-M (27%) yielded positive results. Emphasizing the importance of testing with and without C', 10 sera were only positive with fresh C' added, and 22 were only positive with no C' present. These MMA results indicate a continued need to evaluate red cells for transfusion for each patient and not by antibody specificity alone. Results/Finding: Prior to and following transfusion, NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with TACO (n=160) and Possible TRALI (n=51) compared to those with TRALI (n=12), TACO/TRALI (n=7), and controls (n=335) (p < .001 for overall comparison). Pre-and post-transfusion NT-proBNP were significantly higher in possible TRALI cases compared to TACO cases (p-value = 0.03 and 0.04). Neither differences in (delta) nor ratios of post-and pre-transfusion NT-proBNP were different in cases of TACO compared to those of Possible TRALI (p=0.67 & p=0.27). However, the ratio of pre and post-transfusion NT-proBNP were significantly different between TACO and TRALI cases (p=0.013). Pre-transfusion NT-proBNP levels were higher in cases of TACO (1710 (IQR 389-3850)) compared to that of controls (536 385) ) in subjects without a history of congestive heart failure or kidney disease (p<0.001). NT-proBNP levels correlated with the severity of pulmonary edema as measured by the degree of hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2) (r=-0.27; p<0.001) and hospital mortality (p<0.001).",

While FDA-approved in 2014, some concerns have remained related to the hemostatic efficacy of these products, since posttransfusion platelet recovery has been shown by some to be lower than that seen with CONV platelets. To assess the use and efficacy of these products, we analyzed platelet and red cell utilization over the 16-month transition period. Study Design/Method: For all transfused adults age 18 years and older, we assessed platelet use for those who received only PR or CONV platelets. As an indicator of hemostatic efficacy, we also assessed red blood cell (RBC) utilization by these patients in the 24-hour period following any platelet transfusion. Numbers shown are mean\u00b11SD and significance was p<0.05. Background/Case Studies: Preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) has been declining in use and may be considered in patients who are undergoing elective surgery with significant blood loss if the likelihood of transfusion exceeds 10%. However, PABD rarely has clear indications and is known to increase the risk of perioperative anemia. Compensatory erythropoiesis requires at least three weeks and has not being associated with gender. Here we report perioperative anemia data and gender differences in compensatory erythropoiesis and transfusion associated with the PABD program at our institution. Study Design/Method: This is a retrospective study of the PABD program at our institution over a two-year period (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017). The following data were collected from the patient medical records: patient characteristics, hemoglobin values, dates of autologous blood donation, and transfusion of any blood products. Hemoglobin decrease for females and males were calculated and compared. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 13.1 (StataCorp LP Texas, USA). Results/Finding: 118 patients underwent PABD and donated a total of 141 autologous RBC units. 51% were females and the mean age was 45.3 (range 12-79). 83% donated one unit, whereas the rest donated 2-5 units. Review by a transfusion medicine physician showed that none of these autologous units were indicated. The mean number of days between PABD and date of surgery was 18.9 days. The baseline hemoglobin (Hgb) prior to autologous blood donation for all patients was 13.9 \u00b1 1.5 g/dL, 13.1 \u00b1 1.2 g/ dL for females and 14.8 \u00b1 g/dL for males (p<0.05). Hgb levels measured after autologous donation but prior to surgery were 12.5 \u00b1 1.4 g/dL; 11.7 \u00b1 1.2 g/dL for females and 13.5 \u00b1 1.1 g/dL for males (p<0.05). The mean Hgb decrease after donation was 1.3 \u00b1 0.9 g/dL; 1.3 \u00b1 0.9 g/dL for females and 1.2 g/dL \u00b1 0.8 g/dL, (p=0.76). More female patients (42%) received the autologous transfusion as compared to male patients (32%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.39). 95 units (67%) were wasted from 79 patients. Of the patients who were transfused autologous units, 6 patients received allogeneic blood products in addition to autologous units, and 80% of patients had post-operative Hgb>10 g/dL. Conclusion: The indications for PABD were not clear. In contrast with male, female patients became anemic and did not show compensatory erythropoiesis at the 19-day interval between donation and surgery. Additionally, more female patients were transfused compared to males. Although these differences did not reach statistical significance, they may reflect gender-associated physiological differences. Transfusion of autologous units was also not justified by patient post-operative Hgb values in a major patient subset. Background/Case Studies: Early and balanced administration of platelets is beneficial for the bleeding patient. Rapid infusion systems and fluid warmers are commonly used during perioperative and massive transfusion in order to keep pace with bleeding and prevent hypothermia. In the United States these devices are not approved for platelet administration due to lack of data, and many physicians are reluctant to use them. Avoiding these devices can lead to delayed and reduced platelet transfusion, which is associated with mortality in bleeding patients. We sought to determine the effect of a clinical rapid infusion system and fluid warmer on the in-vitro function of stored apheresis platelets. Study Design/Method: This study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. Units of apheresis platelets less than 48 hours past clinical expiry date were supplied by the hospital blood bank. After mixing, a 2-mL sample was sterilely obtained from each unit. The remaining volume was then run through a commercially available rapid infuser system (The Belmont Rapid Infuser RI-2, Belmont Instrument Corporation, Billerica, MA) at a rate of 500 mL/min while warmed. After the entire unit was infused, a second 2-mL sample was drawn from the most proximal port on the outflow line. A platelet count and maximum amplitude by thromboelastogram (TEG\u2122, Haemonetics, Braintree, MA) was measured from each sample. We estimated that testing 10 units would give us greater than 99% power to detect a difference in pre-and post-infusion TEG\u2122-MA of 10 mm using the paired t-test, with a p-value < 0.05 considered significant. The study was repeated with a parallel sampling protocol using 15-mL platelet aliquots incubated for 5 and 20 minutes in a fluid warmer (Ranger\u00ae, 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN). Results/Finding: All units reached the goal infusion rate of 500 mL/min. No infuser or circuit malfunctions or clotting were observed. Average post-infusion temperature was 37.4\u00b0C (range 36.1 -39.0). There was no statistically significant change in post-infusion TEG\u2122-MA was (mean 0.1 mm, 95% CI -2.7 -2.8, p = 0.973). The minimum and maximum differences in post-pre TEG\u2122-MA were -6.7 and 7.9 mm, respectively. There was a statistically significant increase in post-infusion platelet count (mean 27 \u00d7 103 cells/ mm3 95% CI 4 -49, p = 0.047) equivalent to a 3% change from baseline platelet count. Similar results were seen with the fluid warmer (Table 1) . Conclusion: In a well-powered study, we were unable to detect any significant effect of high-speed rapid infusion or warming on the in-vitro function of stored apheresis platelets. There was a statistically significant increase in post-infusion platelet count, probably the result of disaggregation of small platelet aggregates leading to higher numbers in automated cell counters.",

            "text": "These results strongly suggest that rapid infusion and warming of apheresis platelets is safe. Available guidelines recommend transfusing donor and recipient plasma compatible platelets. However, when platelets are suspended in additive solution, and due to the lower plasma content, respecting cell ABO compatibility seems to be a reasonable approach in order to optimize post transfusion platelet counts. Our objective was to compare two different strategies for platelet selection in ABO incompatible HSCT. Study Design/Method: We reviewed data from two different platelet transfusion protocols used in patients undergoing ABO incompatible HSCT in our hospital: protocol A in which the platelet transfused were plasma compatible with donor and recipient (ABO donor group in major incompatibility and ABO recipient group in minor incompatibility), and protocol B in which the platelet transfused were of the same ABO group than red blood cells concentrates (ABO recipient group for major incompatibility and ABO donor group for minor incompatibility). These protocols were followed when specific ABO platelets were available. Packed RBCs (RBCC) were transfused if the hemoglobin level of patients was 80 g/dL and prophylactic pooled PLTs were transfused at PLT counts 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L. PLT transfusion independence was defined as the last PLT transfusion, with no PLT transfusions in the following 7 days. RBC transfusion independence was defined as the last transfusion, with no RBC transfusion in the following 30 days. We recorded transfusion requirements at 30 days after HSCT. SPSS software (v 15.0) was used to perform statistical analyses. The decrease in transfusion is consistent with trends reported elsewhere. The increase in ARs may be due to increasing incidence and increasing user familiarity with the HM. Within bed size groups, facilities with outlying AR rates are clear. Limitations include lack of data validation, and possible inconsistent case definition interpretation and application. This could lead to under-or over-reporting of ARs. MDPH has collaborated with the CDC to improve the HM, including clarifying reporting of discarded products and testing automated case definitions. These analyses allow for the detection of trends in usage and AR incidence, providing actionable data. Future work will assess the impact of surveillance, and attempt to detect anomalous rates associated with specific products. Wider use of the HM will allow for more representative surveillance, and ultimately safer transfusion medicine practices.",

Conclusion: During the study period, despite a significant decline in the use of blood products, the number of reported AEs remained steady, reflecting increased knowledge of hemovigilance. Despite the high quality of blood products, serious adverse events do occur and human errors account for many of them. For example, for most cases of severe dyspnea, especially TACO the doctors are unable to recognize the cause or possibility for prevention. Likewise, we have yet to see any improvement in the number of AHTRs resulting from blood components intended for another person, reflecting serious deviations from SOPs for patient identification. In the future, we need to focus on improving unsafe practices throughout the entire blood chain, especially the bed side procedures. Checklists to ensure patient identification and risk assessment for TACO, or the revised reporting criteria by the joint AABB-ISBT-IHN TACO task force will be very welcome. Background/Case Studies: Appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdominal pain and is typically managed with either antibiotics alone or in combination with surgical intervention. Hematologic malignancy and its treatments cause pancytopenia which increases the risk of surgery and post-surgical complications. Neutropenic patients, however, may not have sufficient immune response to clear a localized infection even with appropriate antibiotics. Granulocyte transfusions have previously been evaluated in the treatment of neutropenic patients with refractory bacterial or fungal infections but have not been extensively reported for the medical management of acute appendicitis. Study Design/Method: This is a case series of 3 adult patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing chemotherapy who developed acute appendicitis and were managed medically with antibiotics and granulocyte transfusions. Granulocytes were obtained via granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and dexamethasone stimulation of volunteer donors for apheresis with hydroxyethyl starch for a goal dose of 4.0 \u00d7 10 9 granulocytes per transfusion. Absolute neutrophil count was determined prior to and within 2.5 hours after administration of granulocytes. Vital signs and oxygen saturations were measured before, during, and after each transfusion. Results/Finding: At the time of granulocyte infusion, all 3 patients were initially severely neutropenic with undetectable neutrophil counts and were deemed not to be surgical candidates. Granulocyte transfusions were generally well tolerated, with one patient having two reported episodes of fevers and chills. Patients received between 3-4 granulocyte transfusions over a range of 6-9 days until there was evidence of clinical or radiologic improvement. All 3 patients showed immediate increases in their measured absolute neutrophil counts; these increases were highly variable, with a mean increase of 1.35 but ranging from 0 to 4 thousand neutrophils per microliter (Table One) . On days following granulocyte transfusions patients frequently developed either fever or increased abdominal pain, likely related to increased appendiceal inflammation in response to the granulocytes. Imaging studies in all 3 cases gradually improved, showing resolution of inflammatory findings and reduction in appendiceal distention. Conclusion: Three adult neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy and radiologically confirmed acute appendicitis were managed with granulocyte transfusions and antibiotics with resolution of their acute appendicitis. Further investigation is necessary to determine if granulocyte infusions provide therapeutic benefits in the treatment of localized infections in neutropenic patients. ",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Platelet transfusion is a standard approach to prevent or treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients. Due to implementation of improved donor history questionnaires and donor testing protocols, the risks of platelet-associated transfusion transmitted infections have decreased over the years. Sepsis from bacterial contamination of platelets, however, still remains a concern. To further mitigate this risk, our institution migrated our platelet inventory from CONV platelets to an FDA licensed PR platelet product for all patients. Supply constraints during the transition, however, necessitated maintenance of a dual inventory of CONV and PR platelets. We analyzed the incidence of transfusion reactions between We considered both CONV platelets, analyzed with a bacterial detection assay as a safety measure, and PR platelets to represent the standard of care at our institution. Accordingly, when platelets were requested, either product was dispensed by the blood bank as per usual blood bank inventory management policy. For our study, we analyzed the type of platelets transfused, category of any transfusion reaction, and patient demographics. For patients who received both PR and CONV platelets, the reaction was ascribed to the appropriate product based on the timing of the reaction in proximity to the transfusion and the nature of the reaction using National Hemovigilance Network Guidelines. Results/Finding: A total of 79 transfusion reactions were identified following 12,351 platelet transfusion episodes ( . 227 ATR (53.7%) were reported as allergic, 98.2% were non-severe, and in 13 patients the same ATR was identified more than once as they underwent more than one transfusion. In these patients, it was found that the shortest interval between the notification of an ATR, and another was one month, and in a patient the same type of ATR was notified, with an interval of 5 months, being transfused in two different institutions. Of all reported allergies, 69.2% meet a degree of probable or definitive. In addition, 5 cases were life-threatening (3 TACO and 2 TRALI) and one caused death (TACO). Conclusion: Although the haemovigilance programs focus mainly on the notification of severe ATR when individual monitoring of each patient is reported, it is considered relevant for the safety of them to identify the transfusion history in order to mitigate the appearance of new ATR. We also collected the same data for any reactions with positive residual culture results from 2012-2015, to enrich the dataset for positive results. We limited the analysis to reactions in which a single PLT or RBC was implicated; reactions involving plasma, cryoprecipitate, or multiple products were not included. We analyzed the AABB culture criteria to assess their sensitivity and specificity for detection of positive residual product cultures in PLTs compared to RBCs. Definite STR was defined as a reaction with concordance between the bacterial species isolated from the implicated unit and from the affected patient. In a possible STR the unit culture was positive but the patient culture was either negative, discordant or the patient was not cultured. Visual inspection of the plasma was negative for hemolysis. Antibody screen was repeated and found to be negative. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive, and anti-A 1 was identified in the eluate. Anti-A titer of the PP platelet unit was 64. The blood supplier was notified; their testing revealed that 4 of 5 donors had anti-A titer < 200 at immediate spin, while the fifth had anti-A titer of 2048 with saline-IgG (Table 1) . Conclusion: Our transfusion medicine service and the blood supplier agreed that this patient experienced an AHTR due to a high titer anti-A donor in the PP platelet unit. Fortunately, this patient recovered in less than 24 hours and was discharged 1 week later. While it may be tempting to think that PP platelet units dilute high titer antibodies, this case serves as a reminder that out of group transfusion of any platelet, pooled or otherwise, has the potential to cause AHTRs. Bottles that remained negative after five days of incubation were called negative and discarded. Results/Finding: According to the package insert for the Verax test, the limit of detection for both P.aeruginosa and S. aureus is 8200 CFU/mL of platelets, which falls right in the middle of the range tested with spiked specimens. The limit of detection for our culture method was not reached in this study indicating the sensitivity is less than the lowest dilution tested (1.5 \u00d7 10 1 CFU/mL) for both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The bottles spiked at the lowest concentration were nearly 1,000 fold below the concentration required to give a positive Verax result and still went positive in less than a day. Screening tests usually identify mild deficiency (<7 mg/dl), however secondary testing is necessary to identify true deficiency (IgA < 0.05 mg/dL) and demonstrate the presence of antibodies against IgA. We present data from a hospital-based surveillance program for SIgAD in an effort to identify patients at risk for possible severe transfusion reactions. Study Design/Method: From 7/1/2018-4/1/2018, an automated weekly report of low IgA results (<7mg/dL) based on data resulted from our immunology department was analyzed by the transfusion medicine service. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) to assess each patient for SIgAD, and developed an algorithmic approach to identify patients presumptively before discussing each patient with the clinical team, making additional testing recommendations for true IgA deficiency, and documenting the concern for possible transfusion reactions and delayed blood products in the EMR. The goal was to categorize each patient as SIgAD (at least low IgA) or true IgA deficient and assess for IgA antibodies. Results/Finding: There were 75 low IgA test results for 52 patients. A new diagnosis of SIgAD was made for 10 patients, of which five were unexpected based on the clinical impression at the time of the testing. Nine patients with a known diagnosis of SIgAD were also identified: their diagnosis and history already noted in the EMR. Of these 19 cases, three patients had true IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies testing performed: one new and two known cases. Three patients had low IgA and IgM. The remaining 30 patients had at least one of a number of diagnoses that explained the low IgA result. For each new diagnosis of SIgAD, the ordering physician was contacted by fax, email, page or phone. We recommended additional testing to include high sensitivity IgA level and anti-IgA ELISA, and documented possible issues related to transfusion and IVIG administration in the EMR. There were no identified cases of severe allergic transfusion reaction in low or IgA deficient patients.",

This review allowed us to make testing recommendations in their work up and discuss these cases with their provider. Of these new cases, one patient was identified as having true IgA deficiency and anti-IgA antibodies, and testing for nine patients is not completed. This study highlights the importance of communication between the transfusion medicine service and our clinical colleagues, and the interdisciplinary effort needed to help avoid possible patient harm. Table 1) . None of the deaths were associated with transfusion complications. An unexplained drop in the hemoglobin (Hgb) level by 4.6 \u00b1 0.38 g/dl at an average of 4 days following ERTs was experienced by 27 (71%) of the surviving patients. An association between the changes in Hgb levels and the amount of incompatible plasma volumes transfused was not established. A higher mortality rate was present in patients that received >75% of blood volume replaced by incompatible plasma, compared to lesser percentages (Table 1) . Conclusion: Incompatible ABO plasma transfusion in ERTs is a safe and lifesaving strategy that is not associated with increased transfusion related adverse events. Incompatible plasma transfusions accounting for >75% of blood volume was associated with an increased mortality compared to a lesser percentages. However, overall severity of injury cannot be ruled out as a confounding factor leading to increased mortality in this high risk group. Background/Case Studies: During a massive transfusion event, the time required to issue large quantities of blood products and transport them to the patient can be problematic; clinicians often stockpile blood products at the bedside for better availability. Prompted by moving to a new building in which the blood bank was far from the operating room, we implemented the use of Hemoroam 15XL mobile blood storage refrigerators (MBRs) (Roemer Industries, Santee, CA) at our university health system, which includes 2 hospitals, a Level I trauma center, an obstetrics service and a liver transplant service (750 inpatient beds, transfusion volume: 23,000 red cell units annually). Our new massive transfusion protocol (MTP) utilizes a rotation of 3 MBRs to keep blood products continuously available at the bedside. Study Design/Method: Approval and funding were obtained from the hospital administration, and 10 MBRs were purchased and validated. A new standard operating procedure (SOP) for the MBR was implemented, and our blood issuing SOP was updated. Previously, our issue process involved a courier reading the product information to a technologist. In the new process, one technologist issues products in the computer system, and a second technologist checks the products in the MBR against the printed report. The first MBR is stocked with 10 units of red cells and 10 plasma. A room-temperature drawer contains 1 apheresis platelet and if ordered, cryoprecipitate. When the first MBR is issued, a second is prepared. After the second MBR is issued, a third is prepared. The third MBR is issued upon the return of the first, and the cycle can continue as long as the MTP is active. The MBRs were piloted with the liver transplant program, and usage was subsequently expanded to the entire health system, including MTPs and other high-volume transfusion events upon request. Issuing time and usage trends were evaluated. Background/Case Studies: Orders were received to transfuse 2 units of platelets (PLTs) to a 17 year old neutropenic patient with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in the outpatient setting. Two apheresis PLTs were allocated and issued at about 11 am and transfused within the next hour. There were no signs of a transfusion reaction noted during or immediately after the transfusion but approximately 30 minutes after completing the outpatient visit, the patient returned to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever and chills. Blood cultures were collected and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Initial thought was that the patient's central line (port) was contaminated. The following evening the septic symptoms were linked to the transfusion and a transfusion reaction was reported to the transfusion service (TS). Study Design/Method: The blood supplier was notified of the transfusion reaction, but the original PLT containers were no longer available for culture. The 1 st unit transfused had a concurrent plasma available and a second PLT container from this same collection that was transfused to a patient in another hospital facility without any reports of adverse reactions. The 2 nd unit transfused was part of a triple collection with a 2 nd container returned to the blood supplier due to the presence of clots on the 4 th day after collection. The 3 rd PLT container from the 2 nd unit transfused had been transfused to a post-bone marrow transplant patient about 6:30 am on the same day as the other transfused container with no signs or symptoms of a transfusion reaction. Cultures from the concurrent plasma of the 1 st unit transfused were negative, but cultures from the clotted PLT from the 2 nd unit transfused were positive and identified as Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures from the septic patient also grew Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Results/Finding: The initial culture performed on the parent PLT product by the blood center was sampled 24 hours after the collection and was negative after 5 days incubation on the BACT/ALERT \u00ae instrument; additionally, the initial samples were subsequently plated after notification of the transfusion reaction and found to be negative. All 3 PLT containers from the suspect collection were tested at the hospital using point of issue bacterial testing (Verax Platelet PGD\u00ae Test) on midnight of day 3 into day 4 and found to be negative for the presence of bacteria. S. aureus from the patient blood culture and the positive PLT container were sent for genotyping and found to be identical, indicating that the patient's septic reaction was caused by the transfused PLT product.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Although point of issue bacterial screening was performed, it appears that the level of bacteria was below the limit of detection which may have resulted in the false negative results. On the clinical side, even after symptoms of a reaction were present, the initial assumption was that the patient had a central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI). Discussion with clinical staff shows that the current CLABSI investigation process does not include checking to see if blood products have recently been given that may have caused patient to be septic. The other lesson learned was that the TS did not realize that the clot found in one of the containers might indicate the presence bacteria and that the co-components should have been removed from the inventory. Background/Case Studies: Identification of septic transfusion reactions (STR) relies on recognition of signs and symptoms and prompt reporting of suspected transfusion reactions. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with possible STR include fever, hypotension and tachycardia. Current AABB criteria define fever as >/ = 38C with a rise of >/ = 1C; however, hypotension and tachycardia are undefined. The goal of this study was to compare subjective reported symptoms to objective recorded vital signs by analyzing a large database of transfusion reaction reports in adults (> 15 years). Study Designs/Method: We collected retrospective data for all transfusion reactions that resulted in culture of the residual product during calendar year 2016. We also collected the same data for any reactions with positive residual product culture results from 2012-2015, to enrich the dataset for positive results. Vital signs changes were defined as follows: 1) Fever: > /=38C and increase of 1C; 2) Hypotension: systolic blood pressure (SBP) < / = 90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < / = 60 mmHg and 15% decrease from baseline; and 3) Tachycardia of HR > / = 100bpm and 15% increase from baseline. Reported subjective and observed objective vital signs were compared for precision and accuracy of reporting. Results/Finding: Reaction vital sign data from 807 adult transfusion reaction reports were analyzed. Fever was reported in 490 reactions, 120 of these (24%) did not meet AABB criteria whereas 3 of 317 (1%) reactions with no fever reported had a fever meeting AABB criteria. Hypotension was reported in 126 reactions, 31 of these (24%) did not meet definition for hypotension, whereas 48 of 681 (7%) reactions with no hypotension reported had hypotension. Tachycardia was reported in 263 reactions, 109 of these (41%) did not meet definition for tachycardia, whereas 25 of 544 (5%) reactions with no tachycardia reported had tachycardia.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: At present relationship testing is usually performed by detecting 15$23 STR loci using capillary electrophoresis technology. Powerful discrimination can be obtained for parent-child relationship but it may not be confident enough to determine more distant relationships. More genetic markers are needed for the distant relationships. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS), also known as next generation sequencing (NGS), offers the possibilities to analyzing multiple types of markers in a single reaction. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Fore-nseq\u2122 signature system, a novel typing system based on NGS platform, for pairwise kinship analysis. Study Design/Method: 67 individuals from two families were analyzed to explore the efficacy of the Forenseq\u2122 signature system for pairwise kinship analysis. Amelogenin, 27 autosomal STRs, 24 Y-STRs, 7 X-STRs and 94 identity informative SNPs were analyzed simutaneously in one reaction. 5 types of pairwise relationships including parent-offspring, full siblings, grandparent-grandchild, uncle/aunt-nephew / niece and first cousin were selected from these two families and the corresponding likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using either sequence or length genotype data (i.e., LR sequence and LR length ). In addition, the system powers of the STRs and SNPs in the panel were also estimated by simulation. Results/Finding: 54, 9 and 5 additional alleles were observed based on sequence for autosomal STR, Y-STR and X-STR respectively compared to those based on length and 11 novel alleles were identified. 5 mutations were found for STRs but no mutation was observed for SNPs. For 27 autosomal STR loci, the LRs were increased from 9.20, 7.87, 2.01, 2.07 and 0.42 for log 10 LR length to 11.52, 10.12, 2.61, 2.60 and 0.52 for log 10 LR sequence for paternity index (PI), full siblings index (FSI), grandparentgrandchild index (GI), uncle/aunt-nephew/niece index (UNI) and first cousin index (FCI) respectively. PI values for 94 SNPs separated more than those of 27 STRs if two individuals were non-parent-offspring relatives. For the simulation study, the effectiveness was 1 for the parent-offspring relationship at the thresholds of -4\u2266log 10 LR\u22664 and was > 0.9996 for full siblings at the thresholds of -2\u2266log 10 LR\u22662 With an low error rate of 0.47%, 92.79% of second-degree relative pairs could be determined at the thresholds of -1\u2266log 10 LR\u22661, while the effectiveness was only 0.4302 for first-cousins with a relatively high error rate of 2.32%. Conclusion: STR typing according to the sequence information were more polymorphic, which increased the discrimination power for kinship testing. Compared to these 27 STR markers, 94 SNP markers in this panel had advantages in paternity testing especially when mutated STRs were involved or when a relative was an alleged parent. This panel was powerful enough to resolve paternity testing, full sibling testing and most second degree relationships testing with a very low error rate, while more markers were still needed for first-cousin testing. Conclusion: These data support the continued rejection of all samples that do not meet the local patient and phlebotomist identification criteria. Furthermore, these data support performing both an ABO and RhD typing on samples that are collected to verify the fidelity of the initial ABO and RhD typing on patients without a historical ABO and RhD typing on file. Background/Case Studies: During cardiovascular surgery (CVS), infants < 4 months of age are exposed to large volume transfusions. The evidence supporting the use of AS1 RBCs in large volume transfusions is not well established. Blood bank at our institution has performed a volume reduction of the AS1 RBCs for infants < 4 months of age undergoing CVS. It has been a labor intense process and decision was made to switch to washing of the AS1 RBCs by using the Catsmart Cell Saver by Fresenius Kabi. The purpose of this study was to establish that change in process, from volume reduction to washing AS1 RBCs in the Catsmart Cell Saver, prior to placing the patient on the cardiopulmonary bypass will provide safe and consistent results. Study Design/Method: First, we analyzed laboratory characteristics of 6 AS1 RBC units pre and post volume reduction and pre and post cellwash using the Catsmart Cell Saver (table not included in this abstract). Second, samples were obtained at four time points including a sample from the unmanipulated AS1 red cells (pre cellsaver), a sample after the post cellsaver wash, a sample from a pump (bypass prime) and a sample collected 5 minutes after the patient was on the bypass. Blood samples were analyzed for analytes considered clinically significant if outside of the normal range. The blood samples were collected on seven cases at the time of CVS in infants < 4 months of age. Testing was performed on a GEM 4 blood gas analyzer and osmolality was performed on the Advanced Instrument Micro-Osmometer. This particular test was not part of the standard electrolyte panel tested at the time of the surgery thus it was omitted from the last (bypass) time point. Results/Finding: Pre and post red cell washing Conclusion: Potassium and glucose concentrations were high in the RBC AS1 units prior to any manipulation and concentrations were significantly decreased with washing, and increased or stayed the same with volume reduction. Plasma free hemoglobin was slightly elevated prior to any manipulation and was increased with any manipulation of the RBC units, more so with volume reduction then washing. Osmolality was mildly elevated prior to any manipulation. It was about the same after volume reduction and decreased after washing. Lactic acid was elevated in the RBC units prior to washing and was significantly decreased after washing. Summary: Washing of the red cells, using the CATSmart Cell Saver by Fresenius Kabi, prior to major CVS in infants < 4 months of age, is safe as shown by this study. Washing might be somewhat better then volume reduction in providing a final red cell product with electrolyte concentrations close to the normal physiologic values. Retrospective chart review influenced adjudication most often in bleeding patients (Table) . Transfusions for upcoming procedures were only generally appropriate when a single unit was ordered and hemoglobin levels were <8 g/dL. Conclusion: Criteria for prospective screening were largely considered suitable even after further detail was gathered on retrospective review, with the potential exception of bleeding patients. We propose prospective screening of RBC transfusion is likely otherwise appropriate and medical/ surgical wards may be initial targets for intervention. Background/Case Studies: The hemolytic disease of fetus and newborn (HDFN) caused by certain maternal IgG antibody to infant's red blood cell (RBC) antigen is well recognized and typically can be managed effectively with phototherapy, IVIG, transfusion and/or exchange transfusion. Here we report a case of prolonged HDN with a possible inhibition of hematopoiesis, despite intense phototherapy, IVIG, and multiple transfusions. The infant eventually responded to erythropoietin treatment. Study Design/Method: All tests were performed by routine tube method using PEG, LISS, Saline or by use of IgG gel cards. Acid elution and EDTA-Glycine acid treatment (EGA) of RBCs were also performed. Identification of anti-D, anti-C and/or anti-G in maternal plasmawere performed by differential adsorption/elution using papain-treated R2R2 and r'r adsorbing cells. Titration of anti-D and/or anti-G in mother's and infant's plasma is performed by use of R2R2 and r'r indicator cells. RHD genotyping of the newborn was performed using PCR-RFLP and PCR-SSP targeting exon 7, intron 4, the RHD pseudogene, and Rhesus box identity regions initially. Further evaluation by Sanger sequencing for RHD and RHCE exons 1-10 was also done to determine the underlying RH genotype.",

The full term male infant was not visibly jaundiced or hydropic(Total Bili 5.9 mg/dL, Direct Bili 0.9 mg/dL) with Hct of 42%, but had an elevated retic count (9.7%) at birth. Peripheral blood smear showed marked polychromasia with increased nucleated RBCs. He was breast fed right after birth, but with poor feeding for many of the days. The infant blood type was A positive. D antigen typing was predicted by genomic testing due to serologic blocking of D antigen on cord cells (DAT anti-IgG 4+).Genetic sequencing of RHD gene revealed the nucleotide substitution c.1136C>T, which is associated with RHD*DAU0 allele. Acid eluate prepared from the infant's RBC demonstrated anti-G and anti-D.

With the low retic count and positive DAT of reticulocytes, possible inhibition of hematopoiesis by passively transferred maternal antibody was suspected.

Therefore, we also hypothesize that the coating of anti-G may protect against severe hemolysis or inhibition of hematopoiesis by anti-D at birth. Background/Case Studies: The birth of conjoined twins constitutes a rare congenital malformation, with an estimated incidence between 1:50,000-1:200,000 births 1 . Conjoined twins usually present with complex anatomical conjunction, multiple congenital anomalies, and varying degrees of conjoined circulation, posing multiple challenges in transfusion and anesthetic management. This case series aims to summarize our experience in the transfusion management of three sets of conjoined twins undergoing separation surgery at a single institution. Study Design/Method: Medical records of conjoined twins admitted to our hospital for surgical separation from 2007 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Three sets of conjoined twins underwent surgical separation under general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation was performed to determine the extent of anatomical conjunction and associated anomalies. Anesthesia was simultaneously induced in all conjoined twins. Blood usage was tracked through the anesthesia record and transfusion service laboratory information system. Results/Finding: 3 sets of female twins were identified; 2 sets of twins were thoraco-ompalopagus and 1 set of twins was thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus. A multidisciplinary approach was used in the operative planning involving anesthesia, pediatric surgery, plastic surgery, radiology, transfusion medicine, operating room staff, biomedical engineering, nursing staff, and clinical care units. Intradepartmental anesthesia-transfusion planning meetings involved the director of transfusion service, senior and junior transfusion medicine attending physicians, fellows, residents, laboratory manager, and staff supervisors. Based on transfusion-anesthesia meetings, special needs of the blood components were typical for pediatric transfusion with modifications based on hemodynamic considerations and the potential for massive transfusion, i.e. leukoreduced, fresh, etc. All conjoined twins were successfully separated. Estimated blood loss ranged between 400 mL and 700 mL during separation and reconstruction with red blood cell transfusion ranging between 13 mL/kg and 30 mL/kg. ). Non-specific auto-antibody was determined in 24%, anti-Lea 18%, cold-antibody 17%, anti-P1 9% and anti-E 9% ( Table 1 ). The most frequent reason for Ag-positive RBC transfusion was 'negative for indirect anti-globulin test (IAT)' (41%), followed by 'detection of non-specific auto-antibody' (26%), and 'lack of time for preparing Ag-negative RBCs' (2%) ( Table 1) . Clinically apparent hemolysis was observed in 4 cases (1%). Two were positive for anti-Jra, one each for anti-E+anti-Dib and anti-E. Ninety-nine (13%) of 765 cases without adverse effects had the clinically significant antibodies, such as anti-E (30%), anti-Lea (19%) and anti-Jka (10%).",

The main effects of the Backup Pack implementation were on RBC inventory, lab TAT, and productive discussions. While a number of MTP's used more packs after the reduction in pack size, the overall picture did not differ. Greater than half (53%) of MTP's used only the initial pack whether the pack was large (6:6:1) or small (4:4:1 Study Design/Method: An assessment of our current OR blood supply chain revealed a complex process with anywhere from 20 to 34 steps to get blood from the blood bank to a patient in the OR suite, several areas for handoff failures and typical transport times of 30 minutes to as long as 60 minutes in some instances. Blood units, received but not needed for immediate transfusion, were stored in unlocked refrigerators in the OR Core. Units for multiple patients were stored in the same refrigeratorincluding units for those patients who were no longer in the OR-with no mechanical barrier in place to prevent removing the wrong unit. Additionally, there was no effective way to control access to refrigerators, monitor temperature or maintain traceability. Results/Finding: We went live in July 2013 with BloodTrack OnDemand using a HaemoBank device in our 20-room OR, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and cardiovascular recovery room (CVRR). The table below summarizes the results. Supply chain complexities were reduced, eliminating 22 steps. Blood availability in the procedure room is now < 5 minutes-an 83% faster delivery time -without requiring OR staff to leave the inner OR core. Blood wastage, which was previously 5.4% of units issued to the OR, decreased by 78% to 1.1%, saving approximately $90,000 annually. These efficiencies enabled the blood bank to reposition staff and eliminate 1.0FTEs. Blood bank workload related to preparing, packaging and transporting blood productsand tracking down missing or delayed unitshas been significantly reduced. In 2017, a second HaemoBank was installed in a new CVRR/ICU unit. With this addition, the average number of units dispensed from a controlled remote dispensing device increased from 14% to 25% of total red cell usage. Lastly, and most importantly for our patient safety, BloodTrack electronically captures and records blood product movements and verifies that the right blood is removed for the right patient. Conclusion: Implementing BloodTrack OnDemand with HaemoBank devices to manage blood product allocation for the hospital's OR, PACU and CVRR has significantly streamlined the hospital's processes, eliminating hand-off risks, improving availability and reducing costs.",

Terumo BCT Background/Case Studies: A pathogen reduction device that uses riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R+UV) to reduce the potential infectious pathogen load and to inactivate white blood cells (WBC) in whole blood (WB) products intended for transfusion is in development. Several substances have been shown to interfere with ABO blood group testing due to patient sera reactivity to non-blood group agglutinins such as acriflavin (dye used in anti-B typing serum), neomycin (antibiotic), and some monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab) used in immunotherapy, to name just a few. One step in the development process for R+UV leukoreduced red blood cells (R +UV LR-RBC) was to ensure that riboflavin or any other elements of the treatment process would not alter or otherwise interfere with blood type antigen testing. There are various manual and automated blood group typing methods employed in the U.S. One of the more common methods (automated and manual) is the gel column agglutination (GCA) method. This study evaluated the use of GCA for testing the blood type and Rh factor of RBC from untreated WB, R+UV treated WB (R+UV WB) and R+UV LR-RBC. Study Design/Method: Ten (10) Grouping cards. Samples were tested for blood type, with additional unit characterization via cell quality measurements. Results/Finding: On the day of processing, all unit blood types and Rh factors matched those recorded by the collecting blood center, with no changes observed after R+UV light treatment or as R+UV LR-RBC. Cell quality parameters were in the expected ranges for R+UV-light-treated WB based on historical data, with key parameters of pH well above and % hemolysis well below the required values of >6.2 and <1%, respectively. Conclusion: Pathogen reduction using R+UV light did not interfere with A, B, AB or O blood types or Rh factor of RBC from treated WB or R+UV LR-RBC when tested with a common GCA testing system.",

The percent incidence of definite/likely neutropenia or definite/likely/possible neutropenia in all cases was 38.8% and 57.1% respectively. 12 (85.7%) of the cases with definite neutropenia were in the hematologic malignancy and aplastic anemia combined categories and in those combined categories, 50% of the cases were in patients with neutropenia. In the same combined group, definite/likely neutropenia was present in 16 cases (66.7%) and definite/likely/possible neutropenia was present in all 24 cases (100%). Conclusion: Among the reported septic transfusion reaction cases, patients with hematologic malignancies or aplastic anemia are more common than those with other diagnoses. Neutropenia or risk for neutropenia is also more common in these groups that have had septic transfusion reactions. These findings may be due to the frequency of blood product transfusion in these groups, but other causes may be present. Further clinical assessment is warranted. Background/Case Studies: Emergent neonatal transfusions are fraught with challenges. The blood bank (BB) and neonatology services must provide blood in a timely manner while simultaneously adhering to proper blood banking standards and navigating hospital processes and information systems. As they can occur outside of the controlled setting of a neonatal ICU, neonatal transfusion immediately following birth poses its own unique challenges. We describe here our institution's experience in developing a protocol for these particularly difficult scenarios. Study Design/Method: The need for an inter-departmental protocol addressing immediate-postnatal red blood cell (RBC) transfusions was recognized, specifically in the settings of the delivery room, operating room, and emergency department. Key stakeholders included: BB, neonatology, nursing, emergency, hospital admission/registration, laboratory information systems, and information technology services. Challenges to be addressed involved: 1.) unique identification of an unborn patient, 2.) documenting transfusion for said patient in the immediate post-natal period, 3.) efficient communication to BB, and 4.) rapid provision of unmodified, non-crossmatched RBC units while adhering to regulations and standards set forth by the FDA and accrediting agencies. Through multiple meetings, a protocol was drafted to define the respective roles of the BB and neonatology services.",

Background/Case Studies: Selection of a compatible red blood cell (RBC) unit does not include matching for donor sex. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize the evidence examining the impact of sex-mismatched RBC transfusion on recipient mortality. Study Design/Method: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched up to January 12, 2018 to identify randomized control trials (RCTs) and observational studies examining the impact of donor sex on recipient outcomes. A meta-analysis was conducted on eligible studies and generated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) using a random-effects model. A three-level meta-analytic model was applied to emphasize the unknown dependence among the effect sizes. Prespecified analysis was done on the subgroup of cardiac surgery patients. Study quality was in duplicate using the ROBINS tool and certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was assessed using GRADE. Figure) . In the subgroup of cardiovascular surgery (n = 57,712), there was no significant increase in mortality with sex-mismatched transfusions (pooled HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.95-1.22). The data were prone to confounding, selection bias and reporting bias. Certainty of the evidence was very low. Conclusion: Sex-mismatched RBC transfusions were associated with an increased risk of death in this pooled analysis. However, the certainty of the evidence was very low from observational studies. There is a pressing need to further study the impact of donor sex because of its potential widespread impact. Background/Case Studies: The role of immature platelets in transfusion increments has not been elucidated. Immature platelets in single donor platelet (SDP) have greater longevity and are more biologically active than their mature counterparts, and have been used as diagnostic markers in thrombocytopenic patients. In this study we looked at the absolute immature platelet counts in SDP units given to neonatal patients receiving multiple transfusions to determine if they affect platelet recovery/increment. Study Design/Method: SDP units for neonatal patients were identified at the time of aliquot preparation. A total of 12 SDP transfused to 3 patients (4 SDP/patient) were identified over a one-month period. A 1-2 mL sample for A-IPC measurement was collected from units at time of aliquot preparation. Samples were analyzed using an automated hematology analyzer for complete blood count (CBC) and percent immature platelet fraction (%-IPF). A-IPC was obtained by multiplying platelet count times %-IPF. Percent platelet recovery (PPR) was obtained with formula: [post-transfusion platelet countpre-transfusion platelet count]/[(unit platelet count \u00d7 splenic factor)/(total blood volume (TBV))], where splenic factor is 0.67 and TBV was body weight times 100 mL/kg for < 37 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) or 85 mL/kg for > 37 weeks. Post-transfusion CBC were obtained within 24 hours. Results/Finding: Of the 12 SDP transfused to 3 patients, SDP platelet count (\u00d710 9 /L) of 822 \u00b1 418, %-IPF of 1.75 \u00b1 0.91%, A-IPC (\u00d710 9 /L) of 18.10 \u00b1 10.83, and PPR (%) of 972.57 \u00b1 945.66 are shown in Table 1 . %-IPF did not appear to correlate with platelet increment and instead the A-IPC indicated that A-IPC of 13-20 \u00d7 10 9 /L lead to approximately 40% improvement in platelet count. Higher A-IPC appear not to provide additional benefit which could be secondary to reduction in physiological capacity of higher numbers of immature platelets by irradiation. ",

Background/Case Studies: Major Hemorrhage Protocols (MHP) can provide a timely, coordinated delivery of blood products for the bleeding patient. Evidence from military and civilian trauma studies advocate a ratio based transfusion protocol approach, which is now widely adopted by hospitals treating patients with diverse bleeding etiologies. This study investigates the success of a MHP in a tertiary university hospital in achieving these aims, including blood product wastage where the sole plasma product is frozen Solvent Detergent (SD) plasma. Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis of MHP activations over 4 years (2014-2017) was performed. Data was collected using the hospital laboratory information system and electronic patient record database, to determine the number, location, clinical indication of the MHP activation, and evidence of blood product wastage. Results/Finding: One hundred and forty one MHP activations (male, 67%) occurred. Seventy two (51%) occurred in the Emergency Room (ER), 33 (23%) in the Operating Room (OR) and 16 (11%) in Intensive Care. Trauma accounted for just 34 (24%) activations. Gastrointestinal was the most common at 37 (26%) followed by vascular surgical bleeding events at 25 (18%). In 57% of cases emergency group O RhD negative red cells were used prior to MHP activation. When MHP was activated, pre-specified blood packs were requested rather than individual components (off-protocol) in 74% of cases. The median red cell:plasma ratio transfused was 3:2. Post activation delivery time of products varied by product type. Red cell and plasma median delivery times were 22 and 45 minutes respectively. Blood product wastage was significantly higher with plasma (18%) compared to red cells (2%). MHP activation analysis revealed plasma wastage in 46 of 141 (33%) activations. The majority occurred in the ER (plasma wastage, 29 of 46 (63%)) which also has the majority of MHP activations. In 14 of all 46 (30%) wastage cases death occurred prior to transfusion.",

Mislabeled specimens are associated in almost 35% of actual or near-miss patient safety events and pose a serious concern in the Blood Bank (BB). From 2014-2016, there were 29 cord blood specimen labeling errors identified as either mislabeled or unlabeled. In 2016, our organization implemented a second independent sample requirement for ABO blood group verification. While this collection process improved outcomes with type & screen specimens, cord blood specimen collections in the Labor & Delivery (L&D) unit continued to demonstrate inconsistencies in labeling practices. A performance improvement initiative was identified by BB and the Transfusion Stewardship Officer. Study Design/Method: Standard of practice in obstetrical units is for cord blood samples to be collected from the newborn at delivery of all group O and/or Rh negative mothers. L&D is a unique environment in that when a pregnant patient delivers a newborn(s) there are 2 or more patients present in one hospital room which increases the risk of specimen labeling errors. In an attempt to improve the collection and labeling process, a Cord Blood Collection Kit was piloted in June 2016. This prepared collection kit was kept in the patient's room and contained a clear storage bag, a 2mL specimen tube with a neon green advisory label \"CORD BLOOD USE ONLY\" and a red bio-hazard bag for delivery. Results/Finding: Cord Blood Collection Kits were piloted for 90 days in June 2016 in 9 inpatient rooms of L&D. This 3-month trial resulted in a 93% decrease of cord blood specimen labeling errors. Based on this outcome, L&D leadership agreed to the official adoption of the prepared collection kits for best practice purposes, which, in a 2-year period, has demonstrated an almost 80% reduction in cord blood specimen labeling errors. Conclusion: Prior to the implementation of the prepared collection kits, cord blood specimen collection and labeling practices within L&D were inconsistent and non-compliant as evidenced by incidents reporting. After 6 months of prepared collection kit usage, L&D leadership recognized the marked decrease in specimen collection errors, the ease of use of the prepared kits, and the low cost of this intervention. These elements, together, contributed to the ongoing success within the department for improving cord 3) and a reticulocyte count of 3%.

The presence of warm reacting anti-N in the eluate combined with the patient's severe anemia in the days following N + red cell transfusion resulted in a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction secondary to a warm alloantibody to anti-N.

A 1-2 mL sample for A-IPC was collected from units at the time of aliquot preparation for patient transfusion. Samples were analyzed using an automated hematology analyzer for complete blood count (CBC) and percent immature platelet fraction (%-IPF). A-IPC was obtained by multiplying the platelet count times %-IPF. Samples were separated into groups depending on the time elapsed from the aliquot issue to sample run time; < 24 hours, between 24-48 hours, and between 48-72 hours. There were no samples analyzed after 72 hours. Results are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise indicated. Results/Finding: Of the 14 aliquots identified, there were 9 unique units and 5 unique patients, with unit platelet count (x10 9 /L) of 1035.29 \u00b1 237.79 (range 673-1453), %-IPF of 2.19 \u00b1 0.97% (range 0.60-3.70), and A-IPC (x10 9 /L) of 22.23 \u00b1 11.03 (see Table 1 ). There was no statistical difference from the mean between platelet count, %-IPF, or A-IPC when separated into <24 hours, 24-48 hours, or 48-72 hours. Background/Case Studies: Acute traumatic coagulopathy has been associated with increased mortality. Studies have shown that prompt administration of plasma products in a high plasma:red cells ratio in a trauma setting can improve outcomes. Prior to April of 2017, Transfusion Medicine (TM) supplied thawed plasma (TP) for trauma patients after initiation of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP). 4 type A and 2 AB TP were typically pre-thawed on weekdays and 4 type A and 4 AB were typically pre-thawed on weekends. The first round of the MTP consists of 8 TP, so often 2 more plasma had to be thawed to fulfill the first round, delaying those products by a minimum of 25 minutes. In response to a request from Trauma service and in an effort to improve plasma supply times, TM started supplying liquid plasma (LP) in April of 2017 for the first round of MTPs. This plasma product does not require thawing. TM's labeling and dispensing practices were also modified in an attempt to further decrease time to supply plasma products. This study was performed to determine if the switch to LP and the modifications to TM's labeling/dispense procedures resulted in a significant decrease in time to provide plasma for the first round of a MTP. Study Design/Method: This was a non-experimental, retrospective study. Times from initiation of the MTP to dispense time of plasma for the first round were gathered from 1/1/2017 to 4/15/2017 and from 1/1/2018 to 3/31/2018 to determine the dispense times before and after TM's provision of LP and labeling and dispense procedure modifications respectively. Mean dispense times were calculated for each time period. A two-sample t test was performed to evaluate the two period mean difference for significance. Results/Finding: A total of 76 records were retrieved. 16 records were excluded as no plasma products were transfused, thus we were unable to determine the dispense time. The mean pre-LP and procedure modifications time to dispense was 9.81 minutes (n = 30, SD = 4.43) and the mean post-LP and procedure modifications was 5.66 minutes (n = 28, SD = 3.10). The difference between the means was significant (p < 0.01). Further differentiation by shift also showed a reduction in mean dispense time, with the following results: Day Shift 9.67 minutes (n = 6, SD = 3.50) to 5.43 minutes (n = 7, SD = 3.05), Evening Shift 10.86 minutes (n = 15, SD = 4.73) to 6.64 minutes (n = 10, SD = 3.30), and Late Night Shift 8.67 minutes (n = 8, SD = 5.15) to 4.82 minutes (n = 12, SD = 2.93). These results were significant for Evening Shift (p = 0.04) and Late Night Shift (p = 0.03) but not Day Shift (p = 0.07). Conclusion: By switching to LP from TP for the first round of a MTP and modifying the labeling and dispense procedures, TM was able to significantly reduce the time required to supply plasma during a MTP.",

Study Design/Method: Transfusion history from March 2010 to March 2018 and initial ABO/RhD typing was reviewed for pediatric patients less than 18 years of age at the time of most recent ABO/RhD typing and with a documented serologic weak D positive test. Initial ABO/RhD typing at our institution includes gel column technology from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (Raritan, NJ) with pre-loaded anti-D and tube testing using a monoclonal IgM anti-D blend with polyclonal IgG anti-D (BioClone, Ortho). Serologic weak D testing was performed if anti-D results were weak to 1 + or discrepant (e.g. anti-D reagent in gel shows 2+, but tube is negative or weak). The incidence of anti-RhD alloimmunization and blood product exposure by gender was evaluated. The number of RhD negative units that could be replaced with RhD positive units if RHD genotyping was performed was determined based on an estimated 80% prevalence of weak D types 1, 2, or 3 in an ethnically mixed US population and our local transfusion practice to give RhD positive blood products to males with weak RhD phenotype and RhD negative blood products to females with weak RhD phenotype.",

            "text": "Results/Finding: Of 13,187 patients less than 18 years old with ABO typing, forty-eight (0.4%, 23 female, 25 male) were identified to be serologically weak D. 56 RBCs and 43 platelets were transfused to these weak D patients (21 RBCs and 15 platelets to females; 35 RBCs and 28 platelets to males). About 31% of weak D patients received any RBC or platelet transfusions with 69% of these transfusions going to five patients. There was no anti-RhD alloimmunization detected. It is estimated that $17 RBC and $12 platelet transfusions could have been replaced with RhD positive products during this 8 year time period had RHD genotyping been performed. Conclusion: Given the variable rate of transfusion to weak D patients, the decision to perform RHD genotyping should take into consideration the likelihood of transfusion. Although there was no reported RhD-alloimmunization, our population is predominantly Caucasian and there was a limited number of transfusions and limited follow-up. It remains particularly important to prevent alloimmunization in the pediatric population as they will have a greater lifetime risk of associated morbidity. To maximize the benefit of RHD genotyping better mechanisms need to be developed for this information to be accessible across institutions to optimize care and prevent repeat testing.",

A rapid and effective response is vital for a successful outcome after major blood loss. In our institute, the Transfusion Service responds to massive hemorrhage by following a previously developed massive transfusion protocol (MTP). However, the time it took to issue blood products was too long and the clinical feedback has been unsatisfactory. Recently, multiple changes have been made in our MTP to improve the efficiency of the Transfusion Service in responding to such clinical settings. Study Design/Method: Based on a root cause analysis of the clinical issue, the following changes were made: 1) redesigned the paperwork and safety check logistics; 2) pre-assembled MTP packs; 3) optimized/centralized the equipment arrangement in the blood bank work space and 4) MTPrelated staff training. To evaluate the effects of these changes, the length of time from blood bank notification (i.e. activation of MTP protocol) to issuance of the blood products were recorded and compared with previous cases. Paired t-test was used for the statistical analysis. Results/Finding: The average time spent from receipt of the call to issuance of the products before implementation of these changes was 10.10 \u00b1 0.06 minutes (n=4). After these changes, the time spent was dramatically reduced nearly ten-fold 1.75 \u00b1 0.13 minutes,(n=4), P < 0.001. There was no safety-related incidents reported.",

Pts met the following inclusion criteria: inpatient, age 0-18 years, and a minimum of 1 plt order during admission. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit pts were excluded. The parameters of total number of plt orders with indications, clinical services ordering plt, plt transfusion orders indications, procedure associated plt orders, plt count within 24 hours of order, and minimum/maximum plt orders per pt were analyzed with descriptive statistics used to summarize results. Results/Finding: Ninety three pts were included. Fourteen clinical services placed 698 plt orders in total with accompanying indication (mean plt count 44x10E9/L; median 22x10E9/L) see Table. Service that most frequently ordered plts was Bone Marrow Transplant followed by Hematology Oncology. Over 75% of 698 orders were associated with a procedure, and in 25% of those an invasive procedure indication was selected. Mean plt count was 20x10E9/L in pts whose indication was prophylaxis against spontaneous hemorrhage. Sixty six percent (n = 61) of pts had multiple plt orders (mean 11, median 7, range 2 -91). Of the pts with multiple plt orders, 52/61 (85%) had orders associated with more than one indication, whereas only 9 pts (15%) had orders with just one indication. Conclusion: Plt transfusion orders are common among pediatric patients at our institution, with the majority of pts receiving more than one order. Further studies are required to characterize ordering patterns and indications for pediatric plt transfusion. Background/Case Studies: The G antigen is an Rh antigen found on red blood cells that also express either D or C antigens. Anti-G is difficult to distinguish on an antibody panel, where it may be confused with anti-D plus anti-C. Since anti-G is commonly found in alloantibody mixtures with anti-D and/or anti-C, the contribution of a solitary anti-G alloantibody in causing hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is unclear. Two prior case reports of isolated anti-G in pregnancy demonstrated no evidence of hemolytic disease in one D+, C-infant and moderate hemolytic disease requiring prolonged phototherapy in the second D+C + infant. Study Design/Method: A 26-year-old G4P0030 O negative woman was referred to our maternal-fetal medicine service at 36 5/7 weeks gestation for hypertension and alloimmunization with anti-D and anti-C alloantibodies. These alloantibodies were first identified 4 years ago after an ectopic pregnancy; at that time she had received prophylactic RhIg and had been transfused O negative red blood cells. During her current pregnancy she had been followed with serial antibody titers and middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler ultrasound by the referring hospital. Although both anti-D and anti-C titers were elevated above the threshold of 16, MCA Dopplers showed no evidence of fetal anemia. She did not receive prophylactic RhIg during this pregnancy due to the previous diagnosis of anti-D alloantibody. Upon arrival at our hospital, G differentiation testing was performed which revealed the presence of anti-G plus anti-C, but no anti-D alloantibody. Results/Finding: An O positive infant was delivered at 37 1/7 weeks due to maternal hypertension. The neonatal DAT was positive, and the eluate reacted with all D + or C + cells, consistent with anti-G. The neonatal RBCs were D+C-. On the first day of life, the infant developed an elevated bilirubin level, and required 2 days of phototherapy for treatment of HDFN. Hematocrit remained stable and no transfusions were given. Conclusion: Once the presence of anti-G and the absence of anti-D was established, RhIg prophylaxis was administered to the mother postpartum. Anti-G should be suspected in a pregnant woman when anti-D and anti-C appear simultaneously on an antibody panel, and prophylactic RhIg should be administered if anti-D is not present on G differentiation studies. In this case the only maternal alloantibodies were anti-G and anti-C, and the infant was negative for C antigen. This case demonstrates development of mild HDFN attributable to an isolated anti-G alloantibody. Background/Case Studies: Massive transfusion of greater than 10 units of RBC in 24 hours is a well described but increasingly uncommon event.",

We reviewed a year of blood use in a high acuity hospital for non-MTP-activation episodes that met the Critical Administration Threshold-1 (CAT-1) definition of three blood components administered in one hour. Study Design/Method: A year's worth of blood use in a 440 bed urban county hospital was reviewed for episodes of CAT-1 that occurred outside of MTPs. Descriptive statistics of patients and episodes were assembled into tables and graphs using microcomputer spreadsheet software. Results/Finding: The hospital admitted 16,967 patients and administered 13,668 blood components in 2017. There were 309 MTP activations, 77% for trauma, and 195 non-MTP CAT-1 episodes. Such episodes occurred in secondary surgeries for trauma patients, for episodes of bleeding in in nontrauma related surgeries, and in patients with severe GI bleeding. In-hospital-mortality was low in the surgical bleeding situations, higher with the GI bleeds. Conclusion: Apart from conventional massive transfusion situations, smaller episodes of high-rate-of-blood use occur frequently in the acute care hospitals. With rapid correction they are of low mortality. Transfusion services need to be able to support these situations with rapid responses of hemostatic products. Only emergency room and the neurology intensive care unit were considered, as these departments manage the majority of ICH patients and undergo the standard protocol when requesting blood products. The standard protocol for platelets requires initial review of clinician's order by lab personnel to verify patient's confirmed blood type, a current platelet count (within 24 hrs), and number of previous platelet transfusions (within 24hrs).",

            "text": "Orders for two or more adult dose platelet units and platelet count-related concerns require further auditing at the blood bank by pathology resident or fellow. Counts exceeding 20K cells/mcL in non-emergent units or 50K cells/ mcL in actively bleeding patients require follow-up to determine clinical need. In suspected brain bleeds, the clinical goal is to maintain platelet count at above 100k cells/mcL, thus a majority of platelet requests for such patients undergo the standard protocol on the basis of the platelet count alone. In addition, the absence of confirmed blood type may present a delay as it requires blood draw and testing prior to releasing platelet for transfusion. Three TATs were defined: time from admission or symptom presentation to transfusion (TAT1), time from platelet request to issue (TAT2; Blood Bank-dependent), and time from platelet issue to transfusion (TAT3; department-dependent). Results/Finding: Our initial TAT1 yielded significant results, reducing TAT by >50% in both ED and non-ED (Neuro-ICU) patients. The blood bank dependent TAT, TAT2, also reduced TAT in both patient groups (>50%). Data pertaining to department-dependent TAT showed overall reduction but without significance (Table 1) . Preliminary data on clinical outcomes indicate hematoma reduction following Tier Platelet implementation (22.7 and 26.3%). (Table 2) . Conclusion: Tier Platelet TATs reduction is limited to blood banking practices. Further investigation is required to determine the factors affecting the transfusion start times of products once they are received by the respective hospital units. The effectiveness of Tier Platelet over trauma protocols is another area for investigation, as trauma protocols also bypass product auditing. Measures of clinical outcomes were limited to notations on CT scans entered in the electronic medical record within a 48 hour period post-ICH. A more standardized measure of clinical benefit using a combination of CT scans and labs following platelet transfusion would provide a clearer insight. . The number and rate of adverse reactions to PAD transfusion were 16 and 0.1%, whereas those of allogeneic blood transfusion were 1,075 and 0.7%, respectively, with the latter being significant (p < 0.01). Among 16 adverse reactions to PAD transfusion, the most common was febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) at 12 (75%), followed by allergic reaction at 4 (25%). The severity of adverse reactions to PAD transfusion was Grade 1 (non-severe) in all cases. With regard to blood component types, 16 adverse reactions involved: 12 cases of whole blood PAD, 2 of frozen PAD, and 2 of autologous fresh-frozen plasma. Adverse reactions caused by autologous blood conservation were not observed in perioperative autologous cell salvage or acute normovolemic hemodilution in this study. Conclusion: Non-severe adverse reactions were observed on PAD transfusion at a rate of 0.1% at our institution. Background/Case Studies: This booklet continues the educational pediatric apheresis series with a third installment tackling the issues surrounding hematopoietic stem cell collection by apheresis. Over 2000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) occur annually in the United States in patients under the age of twenty. As of 2016, over twenty percent of these transplants utilized apheresis-derived autologous or allogeneic products, an increase from recent years. As with any invasive medical procedure, hematopoietic stem cell collection by apheresis can be psychologically upsetting in the pediatric population, causing fear, pain and feelings of helplessness. These feelings can manifest as anger, aggression, and anxiety, which can lead to increased procedure times, treatment delays, and long term psychological trauma. Studies show that educating pediatric patients and their families on what to expect, as well as hospital staff expectations of them, can reduce these feelings of anxiety, help patients feel empowered, and reduce emotional trauma. Previous projects revealed the lack of age appropriate literature on apheresis procedures in general, including the topics covered in the first two booklets of this series, therapeutic plasma exchange and red blood cell exchange. Study Design/Method: An age-specific storyboard was developed in collaboration with a pediatric hematologist-oncologist and apheresis physicians. The accompanying artwork was produced in conjunction with a medical illustrator to enhance the story for our pediatric audience. Results/Finding: The story discusses why the apheresis stem cell collection is being performed, details the steps leading up to the procedure, and reviews what will occur on the day of collection. Included are strategies for coping, as well as a brief mention of what to expect in the future when the child returns for their transplant. While the storyboard directly addresses the procedure from the standpoint of an autologous donation, the booklet may also be helpful for allogenic pediatric donors preparing for their collections. The booklet has been made available on the hospital website for patient use.",

The hypothesis is that people are drawn to and respond to video. Much of the information transmitted to the brain is visual and visual aids have been found to improve learning. Video learning is advantageous as it engages both visual and auditory channels of the brain. The assertion is that microlearning videos can help in knowledge retention as videos spread the cognitive load on the learner between auditory and visual learning channels. Ten microlearning videos have been created in one year and learners are able to access the videos on demand through the organization's internal website. A banner was created on the homepage of the organization's internal website so team members would easily be able to click the banner and access the Quick Tips video library. Study Design/Method: Videos are developed through the partnership of the Marketing and Communications Department and the Training Department. The videos were filmed at the organization's Orlando location in the multimedia studio. Videos were also filmed in the organization's simulation lab. The scripts are developed by the training department and are then reviewed and approved by the Director of Process Improvement.

The first year residents had 56% correct response rate to the questionnaire which increased to 60% in 2ndand 63% by 3rd year. However, the actual good bedside transfusion practices were followed in less than 30% observations. Improper bedside storage of blood components was a major concern leading to deterioration of the quality of blood components. Best sample labeling practices were being followed in less than 40% observations, and informed consent record was found in less than 10% of observations despite the fact that > 80% had the knowledge regarding the same in knowledge assessment. After educational interventions, there was a slight improvement in the practices like blood transfusion consent, physician order, documentation of patient identity check in the file, improper storage of components in the ward refrigerator but the improvement was not statistically significant. Multitasking by patient bedside without any help from nursing staff in blood transfusionrelated activities was a major reason for non-compliance. Conclusion: The present study gave us the insight that there is a lot of scope for improvement in the bedside transfusion practices in our hospital which can only be achieved through continuous educational efforts followed by effective assessment and gap analysis. . The objectives of the project were to improve current transfusion practices by training medical staff on HV and establishing a system to monitor and evaluate the safety of blood transfusions, while comparing acute transfusion-related adverse reactions (TRAR) in patients who received transfusions of whole blood (WB) treated using the Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System and patients who received conventional WB transfusions. Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (Accra) and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (Kumasi) were the selected sites. Study Design/Method: The HV training plan was designed by AABB's consulting services (AABBCS) after assessment of existing practices of NBSG. The aim was to develop practical training materials to create HV awareness and increase transfusion medicine knowledge among the trainees (hospital and NBSG staff ). An 11-day training program incorporating lectures and practice sessions on the wards was developed using Ghanaian and AABB expertise. AABBCS engaged Dovel Technologies, LLC to develop the HV infrastructurea cloud-based data repository (portal) for electronic data capture, management, and analysis of transfusions and TRAR. The HV training included following topics: 1) quality systems (as defined in the Africa Society for Blood Transfusion Standards); 2) TRAR (based on the ISBT definitions for non-infectious transfusion reactions), near misses and follow up; 3) HV form completion and report writing; and 4) database development and use of the cloud-based portal for analysis. TBCT provided training on the operational process, which included manufacture, issue (Mirasol or non-Mirasol) and administration of blood products. Results/Finding: NBSG is currently monitoring the project in collaboration with leads from the two hospitals. Since the launch of the project in early June 2017, more than 1,100 transfusion records have been reported into the cloud-based portal as of mid-March 2018. An audit, conducted five months post-training, demonstrated an increased level of knowledge and enthusiasm for HV and better compliance to the operational processes. In addition, the principle behind the training (\"train the trainers\") has been realized, as both the HV knowledge and the Mirasol experience is being shared amongst other staff. Conclusion: Establishing an effective HV infrastructure is a multi-stakeholder undertaking. The HV training strengthened quality requirements of transfusion practice through better monitoring and reporting of transfusions and TRAR. Lessons learned will assist in the expansion of similar training programs and HV infrastructure at other sites, with the goal of establishing a national HV system in Ghana.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: There are over 50 requirements that an individual must achieve to be eligible to donate blood. Students may find it difficult to learn all of these requirements and lecture presentations on this topic may be dry and typically unengaging. The Blood Bank Professors in a Medical Laboratory Science program in the Northeast wanted to find a new method to teach this subject matter. This program generally has 30-40 senior level students and the instruction during senior year is designed in blocks which students spend a certain number of days in each content area. The immunohematology section consists of 14 days that include both lecture and laboratory experiences. Having this compressed schedule, there is only one day dedicated to the donation process. In an effort to create an interactive learning experience that fits into this schedule, while providing students with quality content, a workshop was developed with role playing to aid the students in learning these requirements. Study Design/Method: A pilot workshop was designed having students role play the donor interview process to aid in learning the various reasons for deferral. A lecture was presented prior to the workshop to introduce the students to the interview process and donor eligibility. All students worked in pairs and were given an instructor-designed donor binder to serve as a guide during the workshop. The binder contains information regarding medication deferrals, travel restrictions, and two predetermined scenarios containing donor information. Using this information, one student completed the interview questionnaire. The student as the \"interviewer\" was given information regarding the hemoglobin, hematocrit, weight of the donor, and platelet count when applicable as the \"mini physical\". The interviewer then reviewed the questionnaire as well as the mini physical card and asked any follow up questions as applicable. The interviewer then completed a worksheet to answer questions whether the donor was eligible and if not, what was the reason for ineligibility. The roles were then switched so all students had the opportunity to play both roles. Results/Finding: The workshop executed in January 2018 has shown initial success. Students described the workshop as helpful and were engaged during the process. The average exam score for donor eligibility from 2013-17 was 79.3 and the 2018 exam average was 85.8. This anecdotal evidence shows an increase in understanding this content. Conclusion: Although the eligibility criteria for donors is complex and ever changing, this information can be presented in a way that maximizes learner engagement and understanding. There is potential for this workshop to be adapted to train other healthcare professionals in donation facilities or as a competency assessment tool, keeping in mind the time constraints in these facilities.",

The test menu was fully evaluated, including antibody titration. Validation studies clearly demonstrated increased sensitivity of automated antibody titrations; resulting in a two-fold increase in titer on average over traditional tube technique titer results. However, it was unknown whether the age of 0.8% reagent red blood cells was a factor in the sensitivity of the automated assay. Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted comparing automated titration results over time. A minimum of three separate patient sera containing antibodies to each of the following blood group systems were studied: Rh, Kell, Duffy and Kidd. Samples were frozen in multiple aliquots to facilitate study over time. Automated antibody titrations were performed upon receipt of a fresh lot of 0.8% Ortho RESOLVE\u00ae Panel A or B.

The aim of this study is to evaluate operational characteristics of a research use only genotyping platform (IDCORE XT, Grifols Diagnostic Solutions Inc., CA). Study Design/Method: DNA was extracted from EDTA whole blood samples and tested using IDCORE XT and the current system. Turnaround time (TAT) from DNA extraction to final result receipt, and technologist hands-on time were compared for different batch sizes. At the end of the study a questionnaire was administered to each operator to evaluate the ease of performing key procedural steps for each system, using a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the easiest. Results/Finding: A total of 408 samples were tested on both systems. TAT, method comparison and associated operator survey results are presented in Table 1 . IDCORE XT showed a 24.5% and 51.3% reduction in mean TAT and hands-on time, respectively, as compared to the current system. Each operator performed a mean of 5.5 IDCORE XT runs. The mean overall operator rating of IDCORE XT and the current system's key features was 4.4 and 3.7, respectively.

Historical state utilized the Immucor Galileo Echo\u00ae instrument to perform Type & Screen testing and antibody identification through solid phase methodology. Staff encountered an increase in positive antibody reactivity that appeared non-specific and was non-repeatable by the gold standard method (PEG). This led to an increase in turnaround time for critical patients and a temporary elimination of automated antibody panel testing from workflows. Study Design/Method: Additional automated instrument platforms (Immucor Echo Lumena\u2122 and Immucor NEO\u00ae) were assessed and compared to current instrumentation for ease of use, turnaround time, and method comparison; focusing on non-repeatable antibody positivity rates. Staff were trained to use the new instrumentation and compared day to day operations to existing instrumentation for ease of use and workflow capabilities. Turnaround time was compared between Echo\u00ae and NEO\u00ae instruments for Type & Screen sample runs of 2, 6, and 10 specimens as well as concurrent loading of 2 and 6 sample sized runs. Method comparison was performed on twenty samples over a one month period on all three instruments. Samples utilized tested antibody screen positive (? to 3+) on the existing Echo\u00ae and negative by PEG. Antibody screens were then repeated on Echo Lumena\u2122 and NEO\u00ae to assess reactivity. Results/Finding: Staff determined that the Echo Lumena\u2122 and NEO\u00ae instruments were similar to use when compared to existing instrumentation and would not be difficult to implement in the lab. Comparing turnaround time between the Echo\u00ae and NEO\u00ae instruments for Type and Screen testing, it was determined that while the Echo\u00ae had a shorter turnaround time for a 2 sample run, the NEO\u00ae had a shorter turnaround time for all larger or concurrent runs. Turnaround time was reduced by 2-26 minutes, with the reduction increasing as the run size became larger. The NEO\u00ae was able to provide an ABO/RH result 7 minutes faster than the Echo\u00ae. Of the samples that initially tested antibody screen positive on the Galileo Echo\u00ae, 16 of the (INS3) 20 samples repeated negative on the Echo Lumena\u2122 and 18 or the 20 samples repeated negative on the NEO\u00ae. An overall 5-10% non-repeatable antibody positivity rate was found for the NEO\u00ae and a 15-20% nonrepeatable antibody positivity rate was found for the Echo Lumena\u2122. Conclusion: At the completion of the instrument assessment, it was determined that the Immucor Echo Lumena\u2122 and Immucor NEO\u00ae would be acceptable instrument alternatives to existing instrumentation. Factors that lead to this conclusion included the reduction in turnaround time for both Type & Screen and ABO/RH testing on the NEO\u00ae, ease of use of the Echo Lumena\u2122 and NEO\u00ae by staff, and the reduction of the non-repeatable antibody positivity rates for both the Echo Lumena\u2122 and NEO\u00ae instrumentation. This reduction could lead to a decrease in manual testing required and an ability to again use automated antibody panel testing to complete complex workups without negatively affecting workflow or creating unnecessary reagent utilization. Background/Case Studies: Blood products intended for inventory must be maintained at temperatures defined by Federal regulations. We evaluated the Temp-Check (T-C) thermometer (Digi-Trax, Lincolnshire, IL) as a possible enhancement to our existing blood product return process. The T-C, similar to a scale in appearance, takes the temperature of a blood product by reading the outside of the bag as it sits on the device. Temperature is reported as an integer. We were unsure how measurement of the outside of the bag would compare to our gold standard used in previous temperature validations, a temperature probe inserted into the center of the unit. According to manufacturer materials, T-C's are sold with calibration certificates and are stated to be accurate to within one degree Celsius (\u00b0C), but no error range such as the standard deviation or confidence interval is provided. The latter is of particular concern for establishing cut-offs for product return acceptability. Study Design/Method: Two RBC and two plasma units were removed from the refrigerator and allowed to warm toward room temperature. Multiple paired temperature readings were performed with the T-C device and the established gold standard at our institution, a LogTag recorder (TREX-8), (LogTag Recorders, Auckland, New Zealand). A total of sixty (60) pairs of readings were taken (120 total data points). Using linear regression in the software package R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) we found that mean measurement error and variability were independent of the true temperature and that error was approximately normally distributed around the true temperature.",

In vitro manufactured platelets can overcome the issue of supply by providing a ready source independent of available donors. A closed-loop bioreactor system was designed to recreate key in vivo characteristics native to the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in a modified 3D cellular environment. cGMP grade reagents and procedures were utilized throughout the entire process with eventual clinical grade manufacturing in mind. Study Design/Method: The closed-loop bioreactor system consists of a peristaltic pump, cell culture bioreactor, fresh media reservoir, waste media container and a platelet collection vessel. Tubing and strategic placement of valves connects the components to create the closed-loop system. All components, excluding the pump, were designed as onetime-use disposables to move the process towards cGMP. The bioreactor consists of a multi-chamber unit separated by a porous membrane capable of allowing size-specific cellular products to move between the chambers. Cord blood mononuclear cell-derived CD34 + HSCs were seeded into the bioreactor and differentiated into mature megakaryocytes (MKs) with serum-free media. Platelet and platelet-like particles were harvested from mature MKs extending proplatelets (proPlts) through the chamberseparating porous membrane by increasing the shear rate in the celladjacent chamber. Within the bioreactor chamber, HSCs were differentiated into mature MKs at a rate of 26 -77%, n = 14, which extended proPlts in response to flow. Platelets were shed in response to shear forces and were analyzed by flow cytometry and using a hematology analyzer. Mature MKs were counted and analyzed by flow cytometry, and proPlt-producing MKs were assessed by counting cells seeded on fibrinogen-coated plates. Conclusion: Using a novel bioreactor system designed to recapitulate the 3D bone marrow microenvironment and physiologically relevant shear forces, improved MK differentiation and platelet production from in vitro derived MKs. This represents a significant step in the road to producing an in vitro-derived transfusable platelet unit. (RBCs) have not yet been sufficiently addressed. Promising new avenues in cell stabilization include biomimetic approaches based on intracellular conditions found in animals with the ability to maintain viable cells and tissues in a frozen or desiccated state (cryptobiosis). Our approach addresses storage limitations by lyophilizing human RBCs into a powder that could theoretically be stored for several years and be rehydrated as needed for transfusion. This process involves the non-reducing sugar trehalose, a compound with well-established cytoprotective properties in cryptobiotic animals. However, trehalose is impermeable to mammalian cells which hampered progress in using this promising biomolecule in RBC preservation. Our approach utilizes sonoporation for sugar loading of RBCs. Sonoporation is a process in which transient pores are induced in the cell membrane by the ultrasound-mediated oscillation of gas microbubbles. The objective of this study is to verify the efficacy of trehalose loading and longterm stability and functionality of preserved blood units. Study Design/Method: Human red blood cells were obtained with informed consent from donors. RBCs were resuspended and diluted in loading buffer containing trehalose immediately prior to treatment. Lipid-coated microbubbles were added to samples and B-mode ultrasound pulses were applied using an ultrasound imaging system. Trehalose uptake into RBC was confirmed enzymatically. RBCs were cooled to -80\u00b0C at a rate of -1\u00b0C/min followed by freeze-drying. Dried RBCs were stored at ambient temperature and resuspended in deionized water. Cell recovery was measured using automated cell counting and cell viability was assessed by staining with calcein-AM. Results/Finding: Sonoporation-mediated trehalose loading has minimal toxicity as 95-100% of RBCs were recovered after treatment. Trehaloseloaded RBCs showed > 95% recovery and viability after storage at -80\u00b0C, whereas a significantly reduced recovery of 20-40% was observed without treatment (n = 12; p<0.05). Recovery of lyophilized RBCs after rehydration was 16-30% and cell viability in this cell population was 70-80% (n = 12). Without trehalose loading, no viable RBCs were recovered after freeze-drying and rehydration. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that sonoporation enhances delivery of trehalose into RBCs and dramatically increases recovery of intact RBCs following freezing/thawing or drying/rehydration. Although further testing is needed to evaluate RBC function in vivo after dry preservation, our approach offers significant potential to help stabilize the clinical blood supply and to increase the accessibility of blood transfusions in the future. Study Design/Method: Aliquots of plasma suspended PCs were stored in small in-house prepared bags which mimic the storage features of common PLT bags. Six bags were filled on the day of production: five were placed into 22\u00b0C storage with continuous agitation as per current practice, and one was placed into 4\u00b0C storage without agitation. On each of the following five days, one of the RT stored bags was moved into cold storage. After 14days, all aliquots were analyzed for metabolic activity (pH, glucose, lactate), PLT activation and response to ADP by CD62P binding, phosphatidyl-serine exposure by annexin-V binding, supernatant microvesicle count by CD41 staining, and clot formation evaluation using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Results/Finding: With increasing delay in transfer from 22\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C storage, pH dropped from 7.4 to 7.0. This trend was mirrored in a 1.5-fold increase in glucose consumption and 1.4-fold increase in lactate production. PLT activation did not change for the first three cold storage delay times, but thereafter increased from about 63% to 79% CD62P-positive PLTs. This effect was also reflected in an altered response to ADP, decreasing from a high of 14% for the two shortest cold storage delay times down to almost no response for the longer delay times. Annexin-V binding increased from 21% to 28%, and the release of microvesicles increased by 20% between the two shortest cold storage delay times and the longer delay times. 270 therapeutic doses were thawed and transfused to patients. 347 PCs were frozen at Vladimir's Regional blood bank from February 2017 to April 2018. More than 200 CPC doses thawed and transfused into patients. Over 160 PCs were frozen at Tyumen's Regional blood bank from August 2017 to April 2018. More than 80 CPC doses thawed and transfused to patients. Freeze-thaw recovery of platelets was 80% or more of the original population in all blood bank. The defrosted CPC showed platelets at 229 \u00b1 71\u044510 9 cells/dose (Moscow's Sklifosovsky Institute for Emergency Medicine), 170 \u00b1 20\u044510 9 cells/dose (Vladimir's Regional blood bank), 182 \u00b1 72\u044510 9 cells/ dose (Tyumen's Regional blood bank). 52 surgical and 40 Post-cardiac surgery patients, 21 neurosurgical patients and 47 patients after organs transplant (Moscow's Sklifosovsky Institute for Emergency Medicine); 6 oncologic and 41 haematology patients, 7 neurosurgical patients and 7 surgical patients (Vladimir's Regional blood bank); 31 haematology patients, 7 surgical patients and 8 post-cardiac surgery patients (Tyumen's Regional blood bank) were received therapeutic CPC transfusions. Hemorrhage stopped in the subjects given CPC transfusions with no complications seen after that in all medical centers. The 1-and 24-h posttransfusion CCI was 11,200 \u00b1 3,800 m 2 /\u03bcL and 9,200 \u00b1 4,600 m 2 /\u03bcL, respectively (Moscow's Sklifosovsky Institute for Emergency Medicine), 8,500 \u00b1 3,500 m 2 /\u03bcL and 10,200 \u00b1 3,500 m 2 /\u03bcL respectively (Vladimir's Regional blood bank). The 24-h posttransfusion CCI was 9,600 \u00b1 1,700 m 2 /\u03bcL (Tyumen's Regional blood bank). The CCI being high at 24 h would be suggestive of the donor's platelets still circulating in the recipient's blood within 24 hours of the completion of transfusion. Conclusion: CPCs were demonstrated to be highly effective in all blood banks. The marked clinical effect is due to the high performance of CPCs.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Previously the only pathway to volume reduce a source with an antibody of interest was to use expensive and/or laborious traditional methods (e.g. ultrafiltration membranes, dialysis, fractionation, precipitation). Many antibody specificities are not available commercially and must be obtained from plasma of donors and patients. When a source is found, it typically contains additional antibodies since routine screening does not detect antibodies to low prevalence antigens. For antisera, it is ideal to remove these antibodies, including isoagglutinins. Larger volumes of source material can be harder to manipulate and may require multiple freeze thaw cycles to obtain aliquots. This could affect product stability and requires more storage space. A method was sought to volume reduce source material so that additional antibodies could more easily be removed. Study Design/Method: A plastic separation device was made with a 3D printer which created two compartments when inserted in a 14 mL tube and allowed for a 3 mL cavity at the tube base. Source material was added to the tube which was immediately inverted and frozen at -30\u00b0C for 90 min or 24 hours. This created an ice column (IC) between the cap and separation device. The tube was removed from the freezer and immediately centrifuged with a swing bucket rotor at 1100g -1600g, for 4-8 minutes. The separation device prevented the IC from entering the tube base, yet allowed solute to separate from the IC and flow into the tube base. The IC was decanted and the concentrated solute (CS) was extracted through the separation device by inserting a syringe with a blunt needle. Total protein was measured via Bradford Assay. Results/Finding: From the 20 samples tested, the IC had a mean mass of 60% of the initial plasma mass, yet only contained a mean of 6% of the total protein (Table) . The CS had a mean mass of 30% of initial plasma mass, while recovering a mean of 70% of the total protein.",

Fibrinogen plays a crucial role. It is the most vulnerable coagulation factor during hemorrhage, reaching critically low levels earlier than any other factor. Fibrinogen deficit is a strong predictor of TIC and an independent predictor of mortality at 24h. Fibrinogen replacement can improve survival, however, blanket administration is not feasible, due to both the potential transfusion-related complications and the high cost and limited supply of cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate. In result, prompt measurement and data-driven replacement of fibrinogen is now part of current European guidelines for management of hemorrhage and coagulopathy and is increasingly advocated for in the US. Unfortunately, no rapid point-of-care (POC) test currently exists for fibrinogen. The standard Clauss method typically has a slow turnaround time of t>60 min, missing the \"golden hour\" and no current fibrinogen tests are sufficiently simple, rapid, and robust to be performed in a prehospital setting. Study Design/Method: To address the need, we are developing the first POC fibrinogen sensor. The sensor exploits a novel high-affinity/specificity aptamer for fibrinogen and a microfluidic electrochemical architecture analogous to a glucose test strip. Aptamers are well-suited for POC given their chemical and thermal stability, ease of synthesis, and high consistency. This aptamer is a self-reporting probe that enables reagentless detection, greatly reducing assay time and complexity. The sensor electrodes are functionalized with the redox-labeled aptamer. Fibrinogen-aptamer binding yields a change in redox current corresponding to concentration. The sensor was characterized in buffer, plasma and whole blood samples using fibrinogen standard to demonstrate proof of concept. Results/Finding: The novel fibrinogen aptamer exhibits a K D = 1.3 nM, and minimal (<2%) cross reactivity with non-target proteins including Fibrinogen Degradation Products. The prototype sensor quantitates fibrinogen accurately and rapidly across the clinical range (0.5 -10 mg/ml), with LOD of <0.1 mg/ml, CV < 15% in < 2 min. We developed a handheld reader that integrates a smartphone and portable potentiostat to interrogate the sensor; data is displayed and analyzed in the smartphone via a custom app. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a prototype sensor that enables measurement of fibrinogen directly from plasma and whole blood in < 2 min. This outcome supports further product development. If successful, this sensor could ultimately be deployed in ambulance, ED and perioperative environments to improve patient outcomes.",

Serologic testing methods have remained essentially unchanged for over 100 years, relying on visual interpretation of agglutination. With increasing rates of ABO incompatible (ABOi) hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) and solid organ transplants, new testing modalities are necessary. ABOi HSCT patients require extensive monitoring for anti-ABO antibodymediated morbidity including graft rejection and passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS). We aim to develop a novel serologic test for anti-ABO antibodies that is useful in the setting of ABOi transplantation. Study Design/Method: Biolayer interferometry (BLI) is an optical assay that measures the interference pattern of light reflected from two surfaces. We developed a BLI-based assay to measure ABO antibodies in human plasma samples. We determined the lower limit of detection by serial dilutions of monoclonal anti-A antibody into AB plasma. We validated this assay on 20 volunteer blood donor plasma samples. Lastly, we assayed plasma samples pre-and post-transplant from patients undergoing ABOi HSCT. Results/Finding: Serial dilutions of monoclonal anti-A antibody into AB plasma determined the lower limit of detection 0.984 ng/uL). The peak absorbance value positively and strongly correlates with antibody concentration (R 2 = 0.97 Background/Case Studies: Alloimmunization is one of the main side effects of blood transfusion that could severely complicate further red blood cell transfusions, especially for patients with diseases requiring multiple transfusions. Conventional blood group phenotyping by hemagglutination assays, carried out pre-transfusion, is unsuitable in certain clinical situations. Molecular typing offers an alternative method, allowing the deduction of blood group phenotype from genotype. However, current methods require a long turnaround time and are not performed on-site, limiting their application in emergency situations. When rapid decision is needed, tests to be performed near or on-site are advantageous. Study Design/Method: In this work, we report the development of a novel, rapid multiplex molecular method for visual identification of seven alleles in three clinically relevant blood group systems (FY*01, FY*02, FY*02N.01, GYPB*03, GYPB*04, JK*01 and JK*02). The assay was designed for carrying out unitary testing, in specific clinical situations such as pre-transfusion testing for patients when serologic methods failed or in emergency situations. Our test, using a dry-reagent allele-specific lateral flow biosensor, is a pre-PCR handling and DNA extraction-free procedure which includes a multiplex linear-after-the-exponential (LATE)-PCR amplification performed directly from whole blood. The single-stranded amplicons migrate on a dryreagent allele-specific nucleic acids lateral-flow dipstick. Gold nanoparticles, used as reporter, permit the detection of blood group SNPs by the generation of red dots visible to naked eye. The assay parameters were optimized and our test was validated on 108 blood donor samples with known phenotype. Results/Finding: Optimization of the assay includes both multiplex LATE-PCR parameters (primer concentration and cycle number) and lateral flow parameters (migration/hybridization temperature and buffer composition). The final protocol enables determination of deduced phenotype with a total processing time of one hour from receiving the blood sample. Validation showed a 100% concordance rate between deduced phenotype and standard serologic phenotype for the 864 alleles investigated. The transfusion service at a 1,000 + bed community hospital system immediately initiated utilization of psoralen treated platelets. Beginning in March 2016, the transfusion service maintained a dual inventory of psoralen treated (with PAS; platelet additive solution) and non-psoralen treated (plasma-based) plateletpheresis products. Clinicians were not provided an option to electronically order psoralen treated products for transfusion. Rather, order fulfillment for platelets was managed exclusively by the transfusion service laboratory staff and based primarily on product expiration date and patient blood type compatibility. Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted comparing the incidence of transfusion reactions involving psoralen-treated platelets versus transfusion reactions involving non-psoralen treated platelets from March 2016 through February 2018. Results/Finding: During the two year study period, a total 54,811 transfusions were performed across the system to 15,411 patients; which included exactly 7,000 plateletpheresis transfusions. Of the total plateletpheresis transfusions during the period; 2,833 (40.5%) were psoralen treated plateletpheresis products while 4,167 (59.5%) were non-psoralen treated plateletpheresis products. During the study period, a total of 10 transfusion reactions were associated psoralen treated platelet transfusion; resulting in an incidence rate of 0.35%. During the study period, a total of 11 transfusion reactions were associated with non-psoralen treated platelet transfusion; resulting in an incidence rate of 0.26%. Conclusion: Psoralen treated platelets were successfully introduced into a 1,000 + bed community hospital system as of March 2016. In the subsequent two years, psoralen treated and non-psoralen treated platelets utilization rates were relatively equivalent. There was no clinically significant difference (p = 0.516) in the incidence of transfusion reactions between psoralen treated versus non-psoralen treated platelet products. Further, no patient experienced a severe transfusion reaction to any platelet product nor was there any report of bacterial contamination associated with platelet transfusion during the entire evaluation period. Thus, introduction of psoralen treated platelets within this hospital system had no impact on the overall incidence of transfusion reaction to platelets. ",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Despite the introduction of leukodepleted blood components, it has been shown that donor leukocyte engraftment (transfusion-associated microchimerism (TAM)) remains a long-term consequence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in some patient groups. The mechanism by which donor leukocytes survive following blood transfusion is unclear and it has been speculated that genetic factors may be one possible reason. This study was conducted to determine whether there is any association between an individual's genetic profile and the establishment of TAM in blood transfusion recipients. Study Design/Method: Australian trauma patients (n = 86) transfused with RBC units between 2000 and 2012, with an injury severity score of greater than 15, were recruited. Twelve of these patients were found to have TAM. To date, whole exome sequencing was conducted on four patients with TAM and four patients without TAM. Alignment of the exome data to the human genome reference sequence assembly GRCh37 was conducted and analysis of differential genetic variations was carried out. Variations unique to at least 50% of patients in each group were further investigated, with a primary focus on genes associated with immune regulation. Results/Finding: Preliminary analysis has been performed. Many of the changes found in 2 of the four patients with TAM, were present in highly heterogenous genes including zinc finger protein genes and the human leukocyte antigen genes (HLA-B and HLD-DRB1). Some of the most interesting changes were found in genes with unknown function such as Chr4 70257329 variant ID248066. In addition changes were found in the following genes, BTN3A1 gene (Chr6 26405815 variant ID 340887) which has a role in the regulation and proliferation of T-cells and in the CCL8 gene (chr 17 32647356 variant ID 847320) which is a chemokine that contributes to tumor associated leukocyte removal. Conclusion: Next generation (whole exome) sequencing technologies allow for the exploration of genetic variations across different population groups, which can provide clues for the potential indications of mechanisms by which TAM may establish in certain patients. This preliminary analysis provides potential genetic changes that could involve genes that have a role in T-cell regulation and proliferation. It is expected that further analysis with expanded patient numbers will allow for this genomic data to be explored in more detail.",

Similarly, plasma from type AB donors is a key resource for trauma resuscitation as it does not require ABO-type specificity; however the donor pool is limited. Removal of anti-A/B antibodies would significantly increase supply of \"universal plasma\" and matching FWB \"walking donors\", thus greatly simplifying transfusion logistics. The objective of this research program is to develop a cost-efficient filter for specific removal of anti-A and B antibodies from FWB and from plasma sources. Study Design/Method: Human whole blood and plasma units collected in CPD were obtained from regional blood donor centers. Human whole blood was assessed within 5 days of collection. Plasma was obtained frozen and thawed at 37 \u00baC just prior to use. Whole blood or plasma was passed through porous polymer beads containing novel modifications designed to remove anti-A and anti-B blood group antibodies at a plasma/blood to polymer ratio of 16:1. Samples were collected pre and post-filtration and analyzed for removal of blood group antibodies with blood typing reagent red cells and standard gelcard agglutination assays (Ortho Clinical). Effects on coagulation and hemostatic activity were measured by aPTT and PT assays on a Stat 4 Coagulation Analyzer (Diagnostica Stago) and a TEG 9000 Analyzer (Haemonetics, Inc.), respectively. Complete blood cell counts (CBC) were measured on the Hema-Vet 950FS Hematology Analyzer (Drew Scientific). Antibody removal efficiency was calculated as the lowest dilution with agglutination of the reagent red cells. Starting donor titers ranged from 8 -256 for both anti-A and anti-B.

Test products were non-inferior to Control for their morphology score after 5 and 7 days of storage ( Background/Case Studies: Prophylactic platelets concentrate (PC) transfusion is the first line therapy for patients with hemorrhagic syndrome. Purity and function of transfused PC is the cornerstone of efficient treatment. To obtain PC from whole blood samples, blood banks currently use hard spin centrifugation (5000g)-based methods, leading to poor resting platelets yield. Prolonged storage is also an issue for blood banks because of platelet storage lesions. In order to improve platelet quality and preservation for therapeutic aims, we developed an acoustic-based fractionation device for isolation of human platelets from whole blood bags. We have already shown that acoustic platelet separation is an efficient method to fractionate blood in a low shear stress environment (92.8 % \u00b1 12.8 purity, 58.3% \u00b1 19.3 yield), leading to minimal platelet activation and preservation of platelet responsiveness to agonists and function. We now aim to study the impact of acoustic fractionation on platelet storage by comparing the quality of platelet rich plasmas (PRP) produced by acoustophoresis or by soft spin centrifugation (200g). Study Design/Method: PRP obtained by soft spin centrifugation or acoustic fractionation were stored for 7 days at 20-24\u00b0C under constant agitation. Platelets were analyzed under resting conditions and after stimulation with common platelet agonists. We used flow cytometry to monitored the expression of activation markers P-selectin (CD62P), PAC-1 (CD41/CD61) and Annexin V (Phosphatidylserine) and checked morphologic and metabolic characteristics of platelets after 2, 5 and 7 days of storage. Results/Finding: PRP obtained by soft spin or acoustic fractionation showed comparable storage response. Surface expression of P-selectin, PAC-1, and phosphatidylserine increased upon storage in both types of PRP. There was no difference in the surface levels of those platelet activation markers between the two types of PRP. Interestingly, platelets prepared by acoustophoresis retained a slightly increased responsiveness to A23187 and collagen after 7-day storage as compared to platelets prepared by soft spin centrifugation.

It is not known if certain donor demographics are associated with more platelet activation and whether repeat donors consistently have activated or non-activated platelets. This study aimed to understand the platelet activation status of plateletpheresis donors and quantify any changes in platelet activation status across multiple donations and between two collection technologies. This is important as activated platelets and/or their microparticle fragments could affect the immune and hemostatic properties of platelet transfusions. Background/Case Studies: In Taiwan, quality monitoring of blood products is a key issue because the ratio of leucocyte-reduced (LR) products has been increasing to prevent serious transfusion reactions, such as febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR). Currently, we do manual counting with a Nageotte-Chamber for residual WBC (rWBC) enumeration, which is very time consuming and requires technical skill. In 2017 in Taiwan, the blood supply of LR-RCC accounted for 18.04% of red blood cells, with a goal of full LR-RCC. To achieve this, automation will be more important. As we had an opportunity to do a feasibility study of the Sysmex XN-1000's new Blood Bank application (under development) for quality monitoring of blood products, we report the basic performance of this application for the rWBC, using the routinely manufactured LR Red Cell Concentrates (LR-RCC). This study evaluates the feasibility of the Sysmex XN-1000 for analysis of rWBC from LR-RCC samples. Study Design/Method: We evaluated three items: repeatability, stability and correlation with manual count/flow cytometry (FCM) methods. Repeatability: we tested 5-run of rWBC using 10 LR-RCC samples, Stability: we tested stability (after sampling from pack) of rWBC using 3 LR-RCC samples. Each sample was run at 0hr, 3hrs, 5hrs, 24hrs and 48hrs. Correlation: we tested correlation with manual count and FCM (BD Leucocount\u2122), using 30 LR-RCC samples. Results/Finding: Repeatability: When rWBC<1 cell/\u03bcL, CV% was 10-48%; when rWBC > 1 cell/\u03bcL, CV% was 7-16%. Stability: we confirmed that rWBC showed good stability up to 48 hours. Correlation: The results (r 2 and correlation formula) were 0.9896, y = 0.9635x + 0.00001 for manual count; and 0.9941, y = 0.5859x -0.0001 for FCM, respectively. Conclusion: The XN-1000 showed good consistency with the manual count. The FCM results were higher than the XN-1000/manual count, which 150A ABSTRACT TRANSFUSION may be due to the gating area. The FCM included \"rain\" dots, which refer to damaged cells, while the XN-1000 gating excluded suspected artefacts, and the damaged cells were excluded by the manual count which we routinely do. It will be possible to perform routine residual WBC testing with a hematology analyzer platform in the near future. We believe this will improve the workflow of quality monitoring for blood products by shortening the TAT (about 1.8 minutes/sample), raising the QC sampling rate for RCC packs, and reducing the total testing cost including labor charges.",

Collection time often dictates selection of which device is used and which products are collected. In January 2018, our center began using the newest version, Trima Accel 7 with the T-Cuff accessory(Terumo BCT, Lakewood CO). Trima Accel 7 is designed to meet the needs of blood centers for access management. AutoFlow is a feature of Trima Accel 7 designed to reduce access related alerts by making automated adjustments to flow rates based on donor access flow or system pressure issues detected by the Trima Accel device. The accessory T-Cuff (pressure cuff ) is designed to encourage donor squeezing and ensures pressure up to 40 mmHg on the donor's arm. In addition, Trima Accel 7 was designed to enhance platelet collection productivity through modifications to the platelet collection algorithms and improved procedural management. Study Design/Method: Trima Accel devices were upgraded to version 7 software on January 30, 2018. Utilizing the Cadence System (TerumoBCT, Lakewood CO) procedure data was captured for 109 donations through March 16, 2018 (Test).

Platelet product yield, procedure time, venous access alerts and donor information were then analyzed between Test and Control groups. Results/Finding: Following the software installation to Trima Accel 7, an overall platelet collection efficiency increase of 9% platelet yield E11/hour was noted, 4.41 E11 for test procedures versus 4.06E11/hour for control procedures (P < .001). The average procedure time dropped between test and control groups by approximately 6 min (90.6 min vs 96.0 min, p < .001) while improving the reported collected yield by 0.2E11 (6.7E11 vs 6.5E11, p < .001). A statistically significant difference was also shown in the average number of access alerts in a donation between Trima Accel 7 and Trima Accel V6.0. The average number of access alerts dropped from 6.57 per procedure during the Control period, to 0.48 per procedure during the Test period (P value < 0.001). More than twice as many donations completed successfully without an access related alert when comparing the Test period (76%) to the Control period (36%) (P value < 0.001). There were zero donations with greater than 10 alerts in a single donation during the Trima Accel7 period, compared to the Control period with 40/209 frequent access alerts in a single donation (P value < 0.001). The Test and Control groups were comparable for total blood volume (5.0L versus 4.9L) and pre-donation platelet counts (285 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL versus 277 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL). Conclusion: Trima Accel 7 increased platelet collection productivity when compared to current Trima Accel V6.0. Trima Accel 7 also dramatically reduced the number of access related operator alerts per donation. Implementation of this software has enabled our center to collect more platelet components per procedure which contributes to improved cost effectiveness and maintenance of an adequate inventory.",

Storage of RBCs under this condition has been shown to improve the quality of the cells for transfusion. White blood cells (WBCs) in RBCs for transfusion may be responsible for causing transfusion associated graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD) in immunocompromised patients. Gamma irradiation and leukocyte-reduction of blood products for transfusion are currently being used to prevent this serious adverse effect of blood transfusion. It is unknown if the effectiveness of gamma irradiation for WBC abrogation will be affected by the reduced oxygen content in Hemanext RBC. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the effects of Hemanext RBC storage condition on the quality of red blood cells and growth and proliferation of T-lymphocytes following gamma irradiation. Study Design/Method: Two units of fresh leukocyte reduced red cell concentrates (LR-RCC) in AS3 were obtained from Rhode Island blood Center (RIBC). The two units were pooled together to create 600mL of homogenous pool of LR-RCC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated from one or two units of ABO matched non-leukocyte red cell concentrates (NLR-RCC) using Ficoll gradient and CD3 antibody coated magnetic beads per manufacturer's instructions for use. The PBMNC isolated from the aliquot of blood were added back to the pooled LR-RCC at a final concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 /mL. Equal aliquot of 300mL of the pooled unit was added to a conventional PVC red cell storage bag while the other 300mL was de-oxygenated for 3 hours at room temperature with Hemanext Red Cell Processing System, transferred into Hemanext bags for storage at 1-6\u00b0C for 42 days. In vitro metrics (ATP, 2, 3DPG, hemolysis etc.) of red cell quality were measured before, after processing and during storage. After storage for 7 days, 100 mL were removed from each of the bags and the RBCs remaining in the bags were then exposed to 25 Gy of gamma irradiation per standard protocol at RIBC. PBMNC were isolated from the pre-and post-irradiation samples and tested for their ability to respond to mitogens in a limiting dilution assay.",

            "text": "In Background/Case Studies: For decades it has been the notion in transfusion medicine that it would be the \"Holy Grail\" to find an in vitro assay that could tell what will happen in vivo. Despite great efforts put into developing assays such as flow cytometric assessment of P-selectin (CD62P) expression, morphology score by microscopy, hypotonic shock response (HSR), extent of shape change (ESC) and others, none is being routinely used in hospital blood banks for platelet (PLT) inventory management. Recently, the detection of PLT microparticles (MP) has been introduced to assess PLT activation status but clinical validation of an association between high MP and poor outcome is still in progress. This study compared MP content with morphology score and clinical outcome with the goal to reveal the challenges and inform future studies. Study Design/Method: A clinical study conducted at the Vancouver General Hospital, Canada from 2011 to 2014 enrolled 200 hematology/oncology patients. Patient baseline data including pre-and post-transfusion PLT counts and PLT transfusion characteristics including PLT activation status were prospectively collected. PLT activation status was measured as MP content (MP%) by dynamic light scattering (ThromboLUX, LightIntegra Technology Inc., Canada). Morphology scores were obtained by phase contrast microscopy (Nikon, Japan, 100x objective) on small paraformaldehyde-fixed samples. MP% of single donor PLTs (SDP) suspended in plasma was compared to their morphology score and clinical response measured as 1-hr and 24-hr corrected count increments (CCIs). Results/Finding: All patients received a total of 997 transfusions of which 328 were SDP. Patients were 56% male, 51 \u00b1 13 years of age, diagnosed with ALL/AML (65%), 40% were CMV positive, 10.5% tested positive for anti-HLA antibodies, baseline PLT counts were 57 \u00b1 53 \u00d7 10 9 /L and WHO bleeding >1 was rare. Sensitivity analysis revealed that major ABO mismatch, complex cases with multiple transfusions in short succession, patient testing positive for anti-HLA antibodies and patient older than 60 years were confounding factors. Activation status measured by MP% of SDP transfusions not impacted by these confounding factors (N = 54) showed a moderate correlation with 24-hr CCIs in CMV positive patients diagnosed with AML (R 2 = 0.304, P = 0.018). For activated PLTs, MP% and morphology scores of SDP (N=54) showed a moderate inverse correlation (R 2 = 0.315, P = 0.001). There was no correlation for non-activated platelets due to the difficulty to differentiate non-activated platelets accurately by visual inspection. Conclusion: In contrast to relative quality control parameters such as Pselectin expression, MP content and morphology score reflect the entire history of PLTs from the donor to the PLT unit. The data suggest that refining the question might lead to a solution: rather than aiming to predict all outcomes the goal might be to predict the worst outcomes. PLT transfusions with MP% > 15% or a low morphology score have a high probability of insufficient increase in 24hr CCI in CMV + AML patients. Thus, a practical approach to improving overall clinical outcomes may be to avoid activated PLT transfusions for prophylaxis.",

Trima Accel 7 (Terumo BCT, Lakewood CO) was designed to enhance platelet collection productivity through modifications to the platelet collection algorithms and improved procedural management. Study Design/Method: This was a retrospective study consisting of 1,093 donations from January 01, 2016 through July 01, 2016 on Trima Accel V6.0 (Control) compared to 1,995 donations between July 01, 2017 and March 05, 2018 on Trima Accel 7 (Test). Trima Accel procedural data was captured using the Cadence System (Terumo BCT, Lakewood CO).

Trima Accel 7 may enable blood centers to collect more platelet components per procedure which contributes to improved blood center cost effectiveness and maintenance of an adequate inventory. Results/Finding: The average pH at day 5 was 6.9 \u00b1 0.1 (drop of 2% from day 1), at day 7 6.5 \u00b1 0.3 (drop of 7.8% from day 1); the pH of each unit never dropped below 6.2 during the course of 7 d storage. The platelet count per bag did not change significantly during 7d storage, the average volume loss was negligible (1 \u00b1 0.3% at day 5 and 2 \u00b1 0.1% at day 7). Bacterial growth was detected at day 1 before pathogen inactivation in the E. coli and S.aureaus units, but not in the control unit. Background/Case Studies: The review of testing packets at the end of testing adds time to the process. With clients needing results between 10 and 12 hours from sample receipt, every minute is important. Having Quality Control staff separated from the process causes issues to be identified after they occur, resulting in additional delays and rework. In addition, the physical separation of the departments hinders communication. A faster method of providing quality control checks for laboratory testing was needed. This laboratory placed staff within the testing lab to perform quality checks in process and the effect on turn-around time was assessed. Study Design/Method: The first laboratory area selected for study was viral marker testing, which includes antibody testing for HIV 1/2, HTLV I/II, HCV, HBsAg, HBc, and Chagas. A team was assembled to review and identify all critical check points needed within the process. Each critical check point was further assessed to determine if it could be performed inprocess or if computer automation could perform the check. The team identified sample acceptability and external controls as the critical checks to be performed in-process. Work stations were placed within the laboratory testing area for quality staff to perform these in-process checks and procedures and training were developed. In addition, the laboratory information system was configured with algorithms to allow for automatic approval of test results if the critical checks were acceptable. Results/Finding: For each batch of viral marker testing, the in-process checks take 5 minutes, compared to about 30 minutes for end-of-process checks. At end of testing, only exceptions have to be reviewed by quality control staff prior to result release. This process change resulted in an improvement in the average turn-around time as detailed in the table below. Specifically, the average turn-around-time for viral marker testing was decreased 1.35hrs in the Atlanta laboratory and 0.56hrs in the San Antonio laboratory. Conclusion: Implementation of in-process quality control review reduces the time for result release and at the same time maintains the high quality of the review and result release. It is estimated that implementation of additional areas will further reduce turn-around time by up to 2 hours. The reduction in review time will allow the Quality Control staff to perform more detailed quality verifications of areas outside of the testing process, including facility cleanliness, appropriate labeling and storage of materials, training, and safety. (Table 1) was UT19 \"Transfusion protocol not followed\" (31%). Among adult reports, the most common incident code was UT03 \"Product not administered\" (43%). Conclusion: The total incident report rate for pediatric vs. adult patients was significantly different, with a higher rate associated with pediatric transfusions. Pediatric patients had a higher number of \"protocol not followed\" reports while adult patients had a higher number of \"not administered\" reports. Understanding patient safety events related to blood transfusion will help target hemovigilance education and interventions to the appropriate patient populations. ",

This technology utilizes a 2D barcode wristband with barcodes printed on blood component labels. This implementation was embraced by nursing and removed the manual process for two licensed independent practitioners to verify patient identification (mPPID) for all blood component transfusions. Intraoperative (intraop) transfusions were excluded from initial scope. Study Design/Method: A multidisciplinary committee was assembled to identify the feasibility to utilize ePPID for intraop transfusions and address 1) removal of mPPID 2) decrease blood component wastage, and 3) improve compliance for blood administration documentation. A pilot was designed for ePPID installation in only Cardiac Surgery operating rooms (ORs). Training included a video and interactive hands-on sessions led by Clinical Informatics and superusers. A total of 44 anesthesiologist providers were trained. The pilot included 50 cases and ran for 3 weeks. An online survey was created to solicit feedback from providers. The pilot was completed in January 2017, and the committee recommended expansion to remaining 45 ORs, and over 200 providers were trained. The expansion was completed in December 2017. The data included in the pilot: number (n) of cases that used ePPID; blood components (n) scanned and returned to the Blood Bank, which is a patient safety risk; post expansion: transfusions (n) using ePPID compared to mPPID and overall compliance at 30, 60, and 90 days. Massive transfusion events were excluded. Results/Finding: For the pilot, 60 cases were completed by 24 providers. 233 transfusions used ePPID with 0 units scanned and returned. Online survey conveyed providers felt ePPID improved patient safety, decreased blood wastage, and desire to use ePPID for all transfusions. Following expansion, 138 transfusions were audited (Table 1) , 8 showed non-compliance, 7 due to user error with ePPID software. Post expansion showed ePPID compliance increased to 94% compared to 71% with mPPID from a previous audit. At 30 days post expansion, use of mPPID was at 27% of transfusions, decreasing in the later audits.",

Background/Case Studies: Appropriate utilization of blood components is crucial for patient safety and improved outcomes. Based on multiple randomized control trials, hemoglobin (Hgb) threshold for prophylactic RBC transfusion was lowered from 10 to 7 g/dL; however, guidelines emphasize not to use Hgb level as the sole criterion to make a transfusion decision. At our institute, currently the threshold coincides with the Hgb critical value of 7 g/dL. Critical value is defined as a life threatening laboratory value that requires timely provider notification prompting clinicians to take an action to avoid significant morbidity and mortality. Our hypothesis is that critical value notifications are affecting the providers' decision to transfuse when alerted that the hgb level is \u22647 g/dL. Our aim is to determine if having the critical value for low Hgb at the same value as threshold for prophylactic transfusion leads to over-utilization of RBC transfusions. Background/Case Studies: Our hospital-based blood bank is a high volume laboratory that processes approximately 60,000 specimens per year. Blood bank specimens are unacceptable when they are unlabeled, unsigned or missing necessary patient identifiers and documentation. In such cases, a new specimen is requested to be drawn as per protocol. In an attempt to decrease the number of unacceptable specimens, an immediate notification of a Nurse Manager (NM) and a prompt debrief process with staff was initiated in June 2016. To further decrease the number of unacceptable specimens we implemented an additional Quality Improvement process. Study Design/Method: In April 2017, a new patient safety initiative was established and rolled-out facility wide. It was a multidisciplinary effort, including Nursing Education, Hospital Quality and Laboratory Medicine. It included an awareness campaign of \"Be Mindful\" when drawing patient's specimens. \"Be Mindful\" and \"Accurate Patient ID begins with ME\" were two of the slogans used. These were printed on tee-shirts worn by project champions and the blood bank also redesigned its specimen requisition form to reflect this initiative. The new requisition form now includes reminders of important steps in the patient identification (ID) and specimen collection process. A stop sign is used as an anchor on the form, along with the slogans and instructions that include prompts to: bring all labels and requisition form to the patient's bedside, minimize disruptions (i.e. close the curtain), check patient identifiers with documents, label tubes at bedside, two staff remaining in patient room until procedure is complete and two signature-independent patient ID. Results/Finding: The chart below represents the % of unacceptable specimens and the average monthly unacceptable specimens identified by the Blood Bank. The 2016 and 2017-First half (H1) data is prior to and 2017-Second half (H2) and 2018 first quarter (Q1) is post-initiative. Upon reviewing the unacceptable specimens since January 2016, the implementation of this new initiative has led to a 46% decrease in the average number of unacceptable specimens per month since the kick-off in April 2017. Conclusion: The \"Be Mindful\" initiative and its awareness campaign has led to a significant decrease in the number of unacceptable specimens identified by the blood bank. Having the steps mapped out as reminders of the policies related to specimen collection, patient ID and the heightened awareness of correct patient specimen labeling can only further improve patient safety and the patient experience.",

The department's quality error investigations increased by 154 percent in just two years costing the department an estimated $20,000 in labor. In 2015, after identifying this trend, the department began investigating the use of Lean/Six Sigma methodologies to define process based on value added steps with the outcome of decreased errors and quality. Study Design/Method: IMD identified increased process investigations resulting in a high potential for loss of product and revenue. IMD implemented Lean/Six Sigma methodology to reevaluate procedures and find the defects in processes. To begin representatives from the blood center's six distribution hubs mapped out how processes were completed currently. IMD utilized the quality improvement tools published in Tool Time for Healthcare by Langford International, INC. The team began with a System Analysis to identify all processes and how their defects were impacting customers. Upon conclusion of the discovery workshop it was found all six hubs were not operating in the same manner. Slight variances in process were creating opportunities for error. The team used a Process Benchmarking tool to identify where the distribution hubs were operating differently. Upon completion of this activity it was determined that the standard operating procedures needed to be updated to include specific steps and to eliminate over documentation. Results/Finding: Seventeen of the distribution departments standard operating procedures were rewritten to be more inclusive of all hubs and to include more definitive directions for processes the team identified were not being executed the same across the organization. As a result, the department saw a decrease in product quality investigations of almost 45% in just two yearsa total cost savings of nearly $2,700 Conclusion: The Inventory management department is dedicated to a continuous improvement plan and is motivated by the positive results seen over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years.

In the blood bank, per AABB standards, any exceptions to policies, processes or procedures must be warranted by clinical situations and require justification and pre-approval by the medical director. These are generally uncommon events, and individually may not raise concern for systemic and actionable issues. In order to better understand the incidence and context of such deviations, identify potential areas for improvement and education, and as a component of ongoing quality assurance and control (QA/QC), we sought to review our institution's prior occurrences of SOP deviations. Background/Case Studies: On a rare occasion, symptoms of hypotension leading to a transfusion reaction (TR) occur after receiving salvaged autologous blood in the OR. The Autotransfusion (AT) team has a process to investigate possible reasons for these reactions. Due to the infrequency of TR workups, the procedure (SOP) lacked organization and continuous work flow, which hindered the confidence of AT staff. During biennial SOP review, AT recognized the rarely used process had not been revised in five years. In early 2016, AT applied LEAN tools to improve the process and increase efficiency. Study Design/Method: Three trainers applied the LEAN technique 5S over 12 months: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize and Sustain. The 5S framework eliminated obsolete and excessive documentation in the SOP. AT improved the location and number of supplies needed to complete a workup. An educational tool was created and practiced with the team assisted by trainers. The revised SOP was implemented and competency assessment was performed with 12 employees. Events were monitored before and after changes were implemented. A survey was presented to the same 12 employees to measure satisfaction with the revisions. Results/Finding: The new steps were practiced in a wet lab with employees to garner opinions and comfort levels. During the practice scenarios, the trainers gathered questions from the team and included those in a training module for future employees. The SOP was written in a recipe format with action steps. As a result, three pages of steps were eliminated from the SOP. Time to perform the process dropped from four hours to two hours after several timings were measured. Pre-made TR kits were eliminated which reduced waste. Supplies were kept in an organized location for accessibility. Competency assessment was 100% passing for 12/12 employees. From 2013-2016, five events were related to missed steps in the process. After implementation of the new SOP, zero events were reported. A satisfaction survey showed that prior to implementation on a scale of 1-10 (10 being highest); the average employee's comfort level was four. After the revised process took effect, the employees rated the changes as seven on the same scale. Conclusion: Utilizing 5S techniques reduced waste, decreased time needed to complete the work up of the intraoperative TR and increased staff comfort level with the new process. With zero events reported after implementation, the new SOP was recognized to be more streamlined, resulting in increased competency. Gauging the employees' comfort level was an important factor in determining how to change the process to increase accuracy and confidence levels among staff. Background/Case Studies: Proper storage in vapor phase nitrogen freezers (VPNF) and liquid phase nitrogen freezers (LPNF) is essential for ensuring the quality of cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cell products. While our AABB and FACT accredited Progenitor Cell Processing lab has had no deficiencies or incidents with our cryostorage process, in response to a recent well-publicized cryostorage failure, we wanted to determine if our products are truly as safe as we previously believed. Study Design/Method: Operations, quality, and medical staff critically reviewed equipment, monitoring systems, processes, and procedures by performing a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), to determine where and how our cryostorage system could fail. Results/Finding: VPNF and LPNF rely on proper vacuum insulation and lid seals to maintain LN2 levels and temperature. Proper function of the solenoid valve enables the VPNF to automatically fill with LN2. Current process controls to detect insulation, lid, or solenoid malfunctions include temperature, oxygen, and LN2 level monitoring. Redundant alarms and checks will detect freezer integrity failures, but not all manufacturer preventative maintenance recommendations intended to prevent failures e.g. biannual solenoid replacement, were being followed. Manual LN2 level measurement and manual filling is our back-up to assure adequate LN2 levels during automation failures.",

Our procedures did not include standard instructions for LN2 level measurement under these conditions. Our current process controls to ensure ample LN2 supply include standing LN2 orders, manifolds for connecting each freezer to multiple tanks, and monitoring LN2 tank levels. Critical reexamination of our on-site disaster plan LN2 supply revealed that it did not have external access, and therefore was not readily available. Lastly, failure to respond to an alarm is an additional potential failure mode. We use an electronic monitoring system that will contact designated personnel until a response is obtained. In addition, our procedures clearly delineate the parties responsible for responding to the alarms. Only few select staff with enhanced security clearance may inhibit an alarm for longer than 15 minutes, therefore we are confident that alarms would trigger appropriate action.",

Opportunities for improvement that would further enhance the safety of our products and provide additional peace of mind were successfully identified. Background/Case Studies: In healthcare, it is imperative to provide optimal care without wasting resources. A crossmatch that is not followed by an RBC transfusion (Tx) within 72 hours represents a potential area for resource optimization. Concurrently, antibody screens that are unexpectedly converted to a Tx request may result in potentially avoidable delays in patient care. To assess these issues at our own institution, we performed an audit of antibody screen and crossmatch orders, and determined whether they were followed by a Tx within 72 hours. Study Design/Method: All antibody screen and crossmatch orders for which samples were received at our institution's blood bank were reviewed over a one month period. The department (dpt.) of each ordering provider was obtained via the electronic record, and the Tx record for each patient corresponding to an order was referenced to determine if the patient had received a Tx within 72 hours of a screen or crossmatch order. An efficiency ratio (EFR) was calculated by dividing either the number of crossmatch orders by the number of Tx events that resulted from the orders, or the number of antibody screen orders by the number of non-Tx events that followed the orders. A ratio of 1 was considered optimal. Results/Finding: A total of 1139 crossmatch orders and 933 antibody screens were evaluated. 323 (28.4%) crossmatch orders did not result in Tx within 72 hours (EFR: 1.39), and 144 (15.4%) antibody screen orders were followed by a Tx order (EFR: 1.2). Order efficiency differed by department: Emergency Medicine (EM) had the worst EFR for crossmatch orders, while Internal Medicine (IM) had the worst EFR for antibody screen orders ( Table 1) . Conclusion: In our audit, crossmatch orders that did not lead to Tx were more common than antibody screen orders that were followed by an unplanned Tx, suggesting that the former might be a more significant issue for focused quality improvement. Not all departments require intervention, as OB/GYN and Heme/Onc dpt. providers demonstrated highly efficient ordering practices. Future work will include evaluation of non-patient factors in the EM and Surgery dpts., such as protocols or standard order sets, which may be contributing to the relatively inefficient screen and crossmatch ordering practices observed.",

Validation of converted data from a donor legacy system (LS) into a new system (NS) is recommended in the FDA Guidance for Industry, Blood Establishment Computer System Validation in the User's Facility (April 2013). Our team developed a conversion and validation plan and these were executed using Dream Coder, Excel Power Query (PQ), and screen print comparisons. Our conversion plan included a risk assessment of software tables and donor data (DD) elements to establish the number of screen prints to verify data from the LS to the NS. Dream Coder was used to populate information that converted the data from the LS to the NS using vendor provided conversion files. Study Design/Method: Sixty-four tables were provided for the table conversion process. Sixteen tables were not used for data conversion; those tables were not used in the LS. Forty-eight tables were loaded into the validation environment, verified, and then copied into the production environment. PQs were developed using the LS and NS databases, taking into account the conversion of data elements from the LS to the NS. PQ was used to ensure that DD coming from the LS matched when migrated into the NS. Forty-seven PQs were used to compare DD in each database. Each PQ consisted of LS, NS and merged queries. Merged queries filtered out matching records, identifying only discrepant data between the two systems. Screen prints were reviewed to confirm that the converted DD populated into the correct fields in the NS. LS data was migrated about once per week into the NS and any rejected files or PQ issues were reviewed with our Information Technology group to resolve data migration issues. These files were reviewed with the vendor when we could not resolve the issues. When determined that a data migration script needed to be changed, the vendor adjusted the import script and DD was migrated again.",

To comply with the quality control requirement, it is necessary to quantify the amount or harvest of platelets obtained during the apheresis procedure. Objectives: Verify compliance between the scheduled platelets-harvest and obtained in AMICUS cell separator. Study Design/Method: Two devices of the AMICUS separation system were evaluated; (SA1) and (SA2). Prior to verification, the technical support service made the adjustment in each separator on Platelet Yield Adjuster (PYA). The effect of this adjustment was assessed verifying the performance of separators AMICUS simple scheduled harvests 3.5 \u00d7 10 11 , the correlation between platelet programmed in cell-separator and the platelet-harvest obtained through quality control is verified, based on the criteria established by the manufacturer (expected bias \u2264 10%), which was carried out through the statistical analysis of an established protocol (CLSI Document EP09-A2) The platelet count for quality control was carried out using a cell-counter under analytical control by ISO 15189:2012 accreditation. The regulatory requirement in Mexico to harvest platelets of a single product is 2.0 \u00d7 10 11 platelets/ unit in 100% of the units tested, so we decided to make the comparison with the most demanding requirement (AABB, 3.0 \u00d7 10 11 Platelets/unit in 90% of the units tested). We evaluated the distribution in SA1 and SA2 of plateletharvests obtained, the average bias and the percentage of non-compliance with the requirement established against the obtained account. Results/Finding: We performed 480 single procedures; 283 of them in SA1 and 197 procedures in SA2. The average values in the harvest from platelets were 3.65 \u00d7 10 11 and 4.05 \u00d7 10 11 for SA1 and SA2 respectively.",

This would explain the non-normal distribution data obtained in both separators, which would question the use of the EP09 protocol, employed for quantitative tests.

The laboratory had been doing tube testing for the previous 10 years. In preparation to change automated platforms, the decision was made to convert manual testing first to gel. It was thought that with a more standardized and stabile testing platform, testing errors would decrease. However, that was not the case, in particular with manual ABO/Rh testing. Study Design/Method: A control chart is maintained to display events on each of the tests that are performed in the laboratory. These include ABO/Rh, antibody screen, direct antiglobulin test, antibody identification, and antigen typing. The control chart is set up with an upper warning limit of 2 SD and an out of control limit of 3 SD. When the upper warning limit is reached, that indicates that an in-depth review of those events needs to be done. In October of 2017, this limit was reached for the ABO/Rh test and an analysis of events was performed. Results/Finding: Comparison of the number of events that occurred in October 2016 to that of October 2017, doubled from 3.36 to 7.87 per 10,000 ABO/Rh tests. Upon investigation, half of these events were pre gel implementation and half were post. However, looking closer at the post implementation events, they impacted twice the number of patients because each involved two patients. In comparing the pre and post events, the pre implementation events ranged from forgetting to add Anti-D, to missing mixed field, to problems with testing equipment, all of which would be solved with gel technology. The post implementation events occurred when technologists were performing ABO/Rhs on multiple patients and the cards were interchanged when reading and entering reactions in the Laboratory Information System. Labeling cards was left to tech preference, but at minimum, needed two patient identifiers. Techs were trained to verify the specimen label prior to result entry, using the same process as pre implementation, but there was no special emphasis given to techs to verify the gel cards as well. Of the three post implementation events, two were identified by the testing tech after entering the results. The third was caught due to a mismatch on the automated instrument. Conclusion: While switching to gel testing eliminated a range of defects, it created a new one that was rarely seen in tube testing. Because of the uptick of this specific type of event, the lab standardized how techs labelled their gel cards. It is now required that the cards be labeled with at minimum the patient's initials and full medical record number. In addition, techs are required to open the result grids from the card rather than from the sample. If a card is set down for any reason, card must be re-verified prior to resulting. Since this standardization was implemented, no similar events have occurred at the time of this publication.",

Determination of postpartum RhIg prophylaxis can be particularly challenging as this entails testing on both mother and baby, the results of which are evaluated together for clinical decision making, including reflex testing for additional laboratory studies. Any missing tests or deviation from testing procedures can result in failure to provide appropriate and adequate doses of RhIg. Study Design/Method: We examined errors and deviations related to postpartum immunohematology testing and RhIg prophylaxis at our hospital. Errors arising from the provider side included failure to use electronic order sets resulting in omission of fetal bleed screen tests or RhIG orders. Blood Bank errors included failure to perform reflex testing, such as weak D testing on Rh-negative cord blood, or Kleihauer-Betke assay for positive or invalid fetal bleed screens. Other errors included performing weak D when not indicated (Rh-negative baby born to Rh-positive mother), reporting Rhnegative/Weak D-positive baby's type as Rh-positive, or reporting invalid positive weak D results. We initially generated a daily laboratory information system report to retrospectively audit and identify cases in which weak D testing had been missed. Subsequently, in order to prevent missed weak D testing and also address additional failure points in our system, we designed and implemented a \"cord blood worksheet\". Technologists complete this worksheet for each cord blood test, using an algorithmic checklist approach to perform and complete all required tests on samples from the baby and mother. The worksheet also captures documentation related to the timely ordering (by provider) and issue of RhIg from the blood bank. Results/Finding: Since implementation of the cord blood worksheet, we have not noted any errors related to blood bank testing or appropriate administration of postpartum RhIg prophylaxis. Worksheets have made our workflow safer and helped ensure our facility's compliance with AABB Standards. The cord blood worksheet also serves as a valuable educational tool for trainees in our graduate medical education programs. Conclusion: Utilization of cord blood worksheets is a simple yet effective way to guide accurate immunohematology testing, prompt providers to place appropriate orders for postpartum RhIg prophylaxis, and ensure that RhIg has been issued from the blood bank in a timely manner.",

In addition, managers were not getting out of the office and observing where work was being performed, and some of those managers who were performing Gemba Walks did not understand the principles behind doing them. Finally, Natural Work Teams indicated they were not all trained and did not understand the basic principles on how to conduct OE huddles. Over the course of a year, the business started to incorporate OE in their culture.

The validation phase focused on quickly accumulating the required # of collections meeting quality parameters; therefore the approach included carefully selecting donors from a known pool of committed WB donors, staff technical training, vendor education and onsite support. The ramp-up phase prioritized WB donor conversion. The approach relied on core team selection and training. Staff performance management, therefore, was based on conversions rather than total WB procedure or RTM goals. To foster collaboration and remove conflict of interest between recruitment and collections staff, both groups received credit for the collection regardless of procedure type. Steady state would prioritize both donor pool management and new donor conversion, with 2RBC procedure, net success, and RTM key performance indicators (KPIs). The core 2RBC collections team was selected from WB and apheresis pools, not only on the basis of technical skill, but also on positive attitude and the ability to communicate with, motivate and influence others, both donors and team members. The training, which included significant vendor support, encompassed technical aspects but also how to approach donors, how to handle a \"no\" response, and included role-playing scenarios. Prior to the collection date, team members identified good candidates for 2RBC collections based on blood type and size, previewed eligibility, and notified every member of the collection staff. Every staff member making a touchpoint with the donor participated in their onsite conversion. Daily results were celebrated and obstacles were faced collaboratively. Background/Case Studies: Industries including blood donor centers have experienced challenges with disseminating information in a timely, effective manner while maintaining minimal disruption to operations. One solution to mitigate this communication issue is team huddles. Prior to the implementation of weekly huddles, monthly meetings were the primary means of communication. However, meeting attendance was low, blood collections were reduced, and staff survey results indicated that communication within the work unit needed improvement. The intent of the weekly huddle was to positively impact communication by reaching more staff with minimal disruption to the work flow, communicating and discussing updates and issues in a timely manner, and providing a forum for staff to bring forth concerns and ask questions. Study Design/Method: Weekly huddles were implemented in late 2016. Two 5-20 minute huddles are held each week in a central location within the work area, and blood collections are not reduced. Huddles follow a specific agenda template; covering updates to the donor appointment schedule, mobile schedule, training, equipment, procedures, and staff recognition. In addition, general updates and reminders are discussed and staff is encouraged to ask questions and bring forth concerns. In April 2018, a survey was sent to 55 current staff to gain insight into the perceived impacts of the weekly huddle as well as communication preferences. Attendance records from both monthly meetings and weekly huddles were also compared. Results/Finding: The survey had a 45% response rate (n=25/55). Results showed the preferred communication method is e-mail followed closely by the weekly huddle and individual face-to-face which tied as the second most-favored communication method. The less-favored communication methods included monthly meetings, signage/job aids, and Office Communicator. Huddles have improved communication within the work unit according to 84% of survey respondents; with 92% indicating that information shared at the huddles keeps them up-to-date on changes occurring within the work unit. Additionally, 92% agree that the huddles provide a venue to bring forth concerns and ask questions. Overall, 88% of respondents feel that huddles are a worthwhile use of time. Staff attendance at the weekly huddle has shown a 19% increase over monthly meeting attendance. Conclusion: The frequency and effectiveness of the huddle has improved communication as well as negated the need for the traditional monthly staff meeting. The focus of the monthly meetings will shift to educational opportunities. Recently, management staff attended an education event on team huddles and learned new tactics that will be incorporated into the huddle including a huddle board to display information, a dashboard to share relevant statistics, and scheduling more huddles throughout the week to reach more staff and further improve the timeliness of information delivery.",

In keeping with the institutional push for unified processes to achieve better patient outcomes while conserving limited resources, we evaluated existing arrangements within the clinical laboratory. Blood products, pre-transfusion testing, and medical/administrative oversight of transfusion services are currently provided by a regional blood center, a contractual arrangement that began many years ago when the facility was functioning as a small community hospital. The evolution of the medical center and the network necessitated the exploration, development, and implementation of insourced transfusion services, and we describe the processes involved. Study Design/Method: We sought to develop and expand a global vision for insourced centralized transfusion services to serve patient needs at the main hospital and across the network. Gap analysis, project budgets, and Gantt charts were utilized to determine the minimum necessary requirements, associated expenses (one-time and recurring), and timelines for deliverables. Results/Finding: Gap analysis entailed an assessment of existing infrastructure, software systems, personnel, and laboratory equipment for adequacy in tandem with the regulatory, personnel, equipment, and infrastructure requirements necessary to safely support a high volume transfusion service. The items and steps necessary to bridge the gaps were cataloged and budgeted accordingly. The proposal showed favorable return on investment within five years and was approved by hospital administration. We developed Gantt charts to organize deliverables, coordinate task timelines, make an appraisal of appropriate windows for task completion, and to provide aid in formulating and evaluating deadlines for each respective task required. One year prior to go-live, and continuing post go-live we hold weekly meetings with formal minutes to ensure adherence to schedules and prompt attention to problems. Many aspects of the project moved in parallel, while some required a carefully choreographed serial approach, necessitating mapping of events in order to avoid pitfalls. The unforeseen hurdle: all hiring and procurement effort briefly stalled when administration was confronted with the possibility of significantly reduced financial allocations from the state. Conclusion: With careful planning and research, the implementation of a new transfusion service could be achieved on a one year timeline. A timeframe of 18 months would enable adequate buffer to account for unforeseen funding and or regulatory impediments at the state or federal level.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: It is well documented that the laboratory workforce is shrinking due to diminished influx of Medical Technology (MT) and Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT) graduates and the imminent retirement of Baby Boomers. Competition for new graduates can be fierce and applications by experienced MT/MLTs for Immunohematology Reference Laboratory (IRL) jobs in large metropolitan areas are rare. Workload for referral labs is increasing as hospitals outsource more and more antibody work. From 2008 to 2015, workload and staffing in our large IRL increased 48% and 68% respectively. A staff retention rate of only 61% since 2010 and multiple compliance risk factors prompted intensive executive leadership scrutiny and oversight. A deep dive into the causes of our compliance risks identified the needs for stratifying our workforce and mapping each task to the most appropriate job position. Study Design/Method: A complex task timing exercise performed in 2008 and then again in 2015 returned staff utilization figures in our IRL of 125% and 117% respectively (optimal staff utilization target 85-95%), indicating that staff were stretched beyond maximum capacity. Data from this exercise and staff tables of organization were reviewed for the three largest IRLs, two of which had a high compliance risk. Individual staff interviews and observations were performed by an independent party familiar with laboratory processes and procedures. Results/Finding: The two IRLs (B, C) with higher compliance risk spent twice as much time on non-testing tasks such as training, competency assessment and equipment qualification than on testing tasks, while these numbers were virtually identical for the IRL in good standing (A). The IRL in good standing had three to four times the staff in support roles than the two IRLs with higher compliance risk. The data analysis and recommendations of the independent reviewer resulted in the addition of two Lab Assistants, two Operation Support Specialists, a Technical Trainer and an Administrative Assistant to assume most non-testing tasks and increase supervisory presence in the lab. A Culture of Quality focused on First Time Right was implemented, allowing the laboratory to quickly reach regulatory compliance which has been sustained for 17 months and counting. Conclusion: Timing studies coupled with mapping of tasks to job description are essential exercises to maximize the productivity of certified technical staff. Adding staff at lower compensation rates effectively increases manpower and productivity without adding expense. The ability of certified technical staff to focus on testing tasks and increased supervisory oversight enhances regulatory compliance and raises the morale of all staff.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: During intraoperative cell salvage, the perioperative autotransfusion service utilizes either on-board machine or wall suction through a vacuum regulator to collect blood from the surgical field. The existing regulators required costly, time-consuming annual preventative maintenance (PM) by an outside vendor, with additional function verification by our techs. Regulators sent out for annual PM were unavailable for several weeks and a few were inoperable when returned, requiring replacement. An alternative vacuum regulator with lower cost and less time and labor-intensive PM was identified and evaluated against the existing regulators. Study Design/Method: A vacuum regulator designed for cell salvage, \"New Vacuum Regulator\" (NVR) was obtained to trial and compare to the existing general use vacuum regulators, \"Current Vacuum Regulator\" (CVR). No guidelines were available to perform the comparison, so we attempted to simulate conditions of daily use. One of each of the regulator models was attached to the hospital wall vacuum system and set to 150mmHg to aspirate 1000mL of normal saline from a basin. The initial set up used one Aspiration/Anticoagulation Set (ANA Set) with a Yankauer suction tip, and timed how long it took to entirely aspirate the contents of the basin. Since the surgical teams commonly request two ANA Sets, but utilize (MGT4) only one to aspirate from the field, the process was repeated with two ANA Sets, where one line was used to aspirate the contents of the basin and the other was left open to atmosphere. Results/Finding: Using one ANA Set, both regulator models cleared the saline from the basin in 32 seconds. Using two ANA Sets, with one line in use and the second open to atmosphere, the CVR model aspirated the saline in 62 seconds, while the NVR model cleared the basin in 46 seconds. The findings were reproducible on repeat testing. The acquisition cost of the NVR model was higher than the CVR model. However, a cost analysis proved that replacing the CVRs with NVRs would yield a 6-year return on investment since the NVR model has a 10-year warranty and no annual PM requirement. Given the operational test results, high rating for ease of use by the techs, anticipated time and labor savings and favorable cost analysis, the existing CVR models were replaced by NVRs. After implementing the new NVRs, there was a significant decrease in complaints from surgeons about 'weak' suction, reducing the need for troubleshooting during the case. No changes were noted in cell salvage quality control parameters after the switch. Background/Case Studies: Improving communication is known to positively affect healthcare operations and patient safety. Blood Bank (BB) operations can be significantly impacted by interruptions due to phone calls which negatively impact laboratory workflow and potentially affect patient care.

            "text": "Study Design/Method: The aim of this study was to improve communication with the nursing personnel from the outpatient Infusion Center at our institution, specifically to reduce the number of phone calls from that unit and the time spent by the BB staff on addressing concerns. An operational taskforce, Blood Bank Ambassadors, was assembled to bridge the communication gap and clarify workflow for nursing personnel. This group was formed by supervisors, specialists and a medical director. Intervention strategies included establishing a platform to safely share ideas, identifying champions of change on both sides, outlining and addressing most significant concerns on both teams, clarifying common goals and ownership, and establishing baseline and follow-up metrics. Initial meetings were held between Blood Bank Ambassadors and nursing team composed of nursing manager, quality improvement personnel, bedside nurses and information technology specialist. This was followed by additional clarifications and regular communication via email. Pre-and post-intervention metrics were the number of calls to BB and estimated time spent by BB staff to clarify issues and concerns raised by nursing personnel. Results/Finding: Baseline data showed an average of 241 calls per month (October 2017) made by nurses from the Infusion Center serving outpatients on the Hematology & Oncology Service at our institution. Approximately 20 hours per month were spent on clarifying issues related to the BB workflow to the nursing unit. The most common issues discussed were transfusion requirements on requisition not agreeing with patient's file or transfusion guidelines, specimen problems, requests for additional specimen testing, turn-around-time, blood product availability and duplicate orders. After the first interdepartmental meeting followed by additional clarifications via email, the call number was reduced to 27 per month, then further decreased to an average of 2.5 calls per month for four consecutive months (January to April 2018). This represents a reduction of more than 98% from baseline call number and estimated time spent on phone calls. Conclusion: Blood Bank Ambassadors significantly improved interdepartmental communication by asserting common leadership and goals. Internal workflow was positively affected by a dramatic reduction in phone calls and time spent on clarifying concerns. Further experience with other teams may reveal key factors for successfully implementing organizational change. Background/Case Studies: Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) due to the spontaneous formation of autoantibodies against factor VIII is an acquired bleeding disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Therapies include immunosuppression, bleeding control, eradication of the inhibitors, and treatment of the underlying condition. In bleeding patients with hightitered inhibitors, bypassing medications (recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC)), should be initiated promptly. Both of them are FDA-approved treatments with its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, rFVIIa is a recombinant product and thus, theoretically, there is less risk of transfusion-transmitted infections by both known and unknown agents compared to human plasma-derived products, such as aPCC. However, the cost of rFVIIa is significantly higher. Thus, we developed an economic model to rigorously examine the cost effectiveness of rFVIIa and aPCC in this scenario. Study Design/Method: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of adult patients with bleeding due to AHA being treated with either rFVIIa or aPCC for 5 days. Regardless of the treatment, the model was developed such that the patients transitioned into 4 different health states: (1) continuous bleeding, (2) thrombosis, (3) stop bleeding, and (4) death. All patients in the model was bleeding initially and thus, they entered the model at stage (1). Depending on the probability of the treatment efficacy and adverse events, on each subsequent day, the patients either remained in state (1) or entered state (2), (3), or (4), which were modeled as absorbing states, which means that the patients did not transition into other states once they entered one of these 3 states. If the patient experienced a thrombotic event, we assumed that the event was severe so that no additional rFVIIa or aPCC was given. We also assumed that there was no re-bleeding event in this cohort. Model parameters, including probabilities, health utility index, and costs, were gathered from the medical literature, except for the costs of aPCC and rFVIIa, which were obtained from our institutional data. Results/Finding: During the 5-day period, the treatment cost of rFVIIa was substantially more than the cost of aPCC ($19,369 vs. $2,724). The average quality adjusted life days (QALDs) gained for rFVIIa was slightly lower compared to aPCC (4.05 vs. 4.08). Overall, aPCC prevailed over rFVIIa as suggested by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analysis also confirmed the robustness of the model across tested ranges of all input variables. Conclusion: In high-titered AHA patients with bleeding, aPCC is more cost-effective when compared to rFVIIa. Thus, aPCC should be used in these patients if available and if there is no other contraindication clinically. Background/Case Studies: Working in a fast paced surgical setting can make it difficult to establish reliable staffing levels. The unpredictable hours can lead to large amounts of overtime and callback time. These extra hours worked can put stress on the employees and also be a source for a high burnout rate. In January 2017 the Autotransfusion (AT) team implemented multiple staffing tools to accommodate the high paced surgical environment while creating an improved work-life balance for twelve AT technicians. Study Design/Method: The AT team collected data from all cases in 2016 where AT performed blood salvage procedures to determine the potential changes to the 2017 staffing model. This data included the average length of time a patient was in the operating room (OR) which was 6.32 hours and average number of surgical cases for a 24-hour period which was 16 cases. This data analysis defended the following additions to the AT schedule:",

In addition to schedule changes, AT implemented a point-system and communication (SBAR) sheet to assist in determining staffing at shift change in August 2017. Each day, current surgical cases were assigned points which translated to how many staff was needed at the end of a scheduled shift (e.g. one OR = one point). This process withdrew any emotion when determining if staff was required to stay overtime. Results/Finding: There was a slight increase (1%) in AT-staffed cases between 2016 and 2017. Overtime decreased and on-call hours increased, however there was a minimal increase (<1%) in call-back hours per on-call position ( Table 1 ). The point-system data indicated that at the end of first shift (0700-1530), approximately eight points were assigned to the scheduled surgical cases. This number of points specified that on average, four technicians were needed to staff at 1530 each day. Prior to the implementation of this tool, the number of technicians needed to staff varied and was decided by the evening shift technician. Conclusion: By introducing the staffing to workload tools, AT was able to make changes to the staffing model. This improved staffing model resulted in a decrease of overtime, less call-back hours per shift, and a positive work-life balance.",

This allowed performance and billing for professional nursing and physician consultative services associated with TB. MC served those whose diagnoses did not allow for crossover of the phlebotomized products to the allogeneic inventory. Summarized are operational, financial and regulatory processes. Study Design/Method: Project was championed by Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and supported by BC Senior Executive Management (SEC). Multidisciplinary working group was established that included from BC: project manager, physicians, training, procedure writers, therapeutic apheresis nursing (TAN), marketing, finance, quality assurance, information technology and facilities; external consultants: billing and credentialing specialists and health-care attorney. Credentialing of MC and physicians with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and contracts with private carriers needed to be completed for payment. MC needed to be inspected and licensed by Agency for Health Care Administration and procedures written in accordance with appropriate laws and regulations. New electronic medical record (EMR) was created that allowed patient information entered on one tablet to be synced across devices. Method of collecting insurance copayments was createdallowing for credit card processing (cash or checks not accepted). Pilot program was launched using existing BC space with modifications to reconfigure reception area ensuring EMR was not visible to patients. BC physician and TAN staffed MC.

Results/Finding: Workflow was as follows: 1) prior -patient scheduled appointment (walk-ins not accepted), insurance and prescription verified and co-payments confirmed; 2) day of presentationcheck-in, copayment and health screening including vitals performed by TAN Background/Case Studies: In 2004, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Program integrated blood safety activities into its key strategies in countries with high prevalence of HIV, or a weak blood safety system, or both. The goal was to strengthen their Blood Transfusion Services through a decrease of HIV and other transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), and provide a universal access to safe blood. A standardized screening program implemented in these countries' national and regional blood centers encompassed a questionnaire for screening of HIV-risk behavior to exclude potential high-risk blood donors, and a universal laboratory testing for HIV and other TTIs. There is currently a major gap in quantifying the impact of PEPFAR on HIV transmission risks through blood donations. Study Design/Method: World Health Organization Global Database on Blood Safety data were analyzed from 28 selected PEPFAR-supported countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Caribbean from 2004-2015. Statistical analysis was performed using AIM (AIDS Impact Model) and Goals modules of the Spectrum Software version 5.53, and laboratory quality for HIV testing was assumed to have 91.9% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity. Country-specific incidence rate of HIV was calculated from prevalence rate of HIV infection transmitted from blood transfusions through infected blood donations over time. The impact of laboratory testing programs for blood donations on HIV transmission risk through blood transfusions was determined by estimating the number of new HIV infections averted since the implementation of the PEPFAR program. Results/Finding: Results indicated that HIV incidence rates in blood donations showed decreasing trends in 20 sub-Saharan African countries, Cambodia, and Haiti. The following patterns were observed: wide U-shaped trends in Ghana, Lesotho, Guyana; reverse J-shaped in Ethiopia; inverted wide U-shaped in Tajikistan Background/Case Studies: The most detailed information about transfusion of whole blood and blood components in electronic health records (EHR) is recorded with the Information Standard for Blood and Transplant (ISBT)-128 coding system in the United States (U.S.). The ISBT-128 coding system adds sensitivity and granularity to blood surveillance which other coding systems, such as billing and reimbursement codes, may lack. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Effectiveness and Research (CBER) recently established the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative, a part of the CBER Sentinel Program. The aim of this study is to characterize the prevalence of whole blood and blood components transfusion from 2012 to 2017 using ISBT-128 codes from participating data partners in the BEST Initiative. Study Design/Method: We explored approximately 24 million patient records from three EHR databases (Columbia University, Stanford University, and Regenstrief Institute) along with a library of 14,543 ISBT-128 codes. We assessed transfusion of whole blood or a blood component (red blood cells, plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets). Results/Finding: Transfusion trends of blood components varied between 2012 and 2017. Of the 624,519 total transfusion events, red blood cells (RBCs) accounted for more than half (51.1%) of events, with platelets (21.8%), plasma (9.4%), cryoprecipitate (2.7%), and whole blood (0.01%) comprising the remaining events. We observed increasing RBC transfusion events up through 2016, a suggestion of increasing administration of cryoprecipitate, and relatively consistent use of plasma. There is overall downward trend in administration of platelets. Whole blood usage was minimal and became obsolete over the study period. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that using the ISBT-128 coding system is feasible and well-captured within the BEST EHR databases. Incorporation of ISBT-128 codes into the CBER blood surveillance system can enhance hemovigilance activities and will afford FDA the ability to actively monitor blood component utilization and transfusion-related adverse events.",

A recent paper modeling 8 different IM for HIV using simulated donation and infection data found that the IM used by our investigators since 2002 (ELM -Extended Lookback Method) resulted in biased estimates and that a different IM (CM -Conventional Method) was preferred for IR estimation (Brambilla, Transfusion 2016).",

            "text": "To assess how these 2 IM performed with actual donor data, we calculated HIV and HCV IR for five 2-year estimation intervals (EI) at our organization. Table) . For CM, the IR was usually double the IR of ELM, with corresponding PT of 1.2 million and 4.0 million for each method, respectively. The same pattern was generally seen for HCV except in years 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 where the CM and ELM IRs were closer. Conclusion: In contrast to the 2016 analysis using simulated data, CM in our population of actual RPT donors produced consistently higher IR compared to ELM. The advantage to ELM is that more positive donors identified during the EI can be utilized, but the concern is that the corresponding increase in PT of the entire population does not compensate for this. While we did find that ELM identified more incident donors than CM, the ELM PT was usually more than 3x that of PT in CM, while the number of incident donors captured by ELM was no more than 2x greater. The larger denominator, without an equal increase in the numerator, resulted in lower ELM IR. Simulations can attempt to model different conditions such as changes in donation frequency and number of positive donations, but may not match the actual changes in the donor population, as observed here. Given rapid shifts in donor collections in recent years, differences in methods are difficult to model, and thus both incidence methods will likely continue to be used. However, blood product availability is limited for many patients throughout the world. In order to improve access to blood products it is crucial to provide countries with enough detail about transfusion needs to enable targeted investments. To determine the need for transfusion services at the country level, disease prevalence information as well as disease specific transfusion rates are required. Disease prevalence estimates are available from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 195 countries, by sex, age, and over time. We propose to use administrative data to determine transfusion rates by GBD cause and to apply these rates to the GBD prevalence estimates in order to determine blood product needs by country, and over time. Study Design/Method: As an initial step in our analysis, we used the Truven Analytics 2010 and 2012 Marketscan database and the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2000 to 2012 to determine packed red blood (PRBC) and platelet transfusion proportions by disease category and inpatient encounter. Disease categories were defined based on the Global Burden of Disease 2016 cause list. For each inpatient encounter the principal diagnosis was used to determine the most likely indication for transfusion. A transfusion event was defined as at least one packed red blood cell or platelet transfusion procedure code (ICD-9-CM code, 99.04 and 99.05) per inpatient encounter.",

Among the cancer related anemias, leukemias and multiple myeloma had the highest proportion of admissions with at least one transfusion (23% to 35%). Conclusion: Population level requirements for blood products depend on the location specific epidemiological and disease profile. By using administrative datasets, indications for transfusions can be determined. Next steps in our analysis will be to determine disease specific transfusion rates and to apply these transfusion rates to the disease prevalence estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study for 195 countries. These estimates of the number of needed blood transfusions will be contrasted with current transfusion availability as reported in the WHO Global Database on blood safety. Background/Case Studies: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia affecting 1.5% of individuals in the developed world and 5% of those over 65 years of age. AF is likely underdiagnosed, resulting in therapeutic delays and increasing complication risks. A pilot program screening for AF with a mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) application was instituted at a community blood center to benefit donors by alerting those with possible AF to seek further medical evaluation. Study Design/Method: Following blood collection, donors aged 18 or older were invited by a volunteer to be screened for AF. After giving informed consent, they completed anonymous Demographics and Medical History forms. An AF screening ECG application loaded onto a tablet device was used to assess heart rhythms. Results (Normal, Unclassified, Unreadable, Possible AF) were recorded for each subject. Those with Possible AF results recieved a copy of their heart tracings and were advised to consult a health provider. Participants also completed an evaluation incorporating a five-level Likert scale (1=most unfavorable; 5=most favorable). Results/Finding: A total of 1000 donors (average age of 43.0) were screened. The majority were female (61.2%) and Caucasian (76.2%). Most were allogeneic donors (99%) and had a health provider (84.2%). A minority of subjects (39) reported a previous AF evaluation. Most interpretations were Normal. Of these, two (plus one unsure) had a previous AF diagnosis but denied current AF. Thirty (plus one unsure) reported an irregular pulse history. Possible AF results totaled seven, of whom none was previously evaluated for AF (though two reported an irregular pulse history). The average age of those with Possible AF (31.6) was less than those with a Normal screen (43.3). Refer to Table 1 for further cohort characterizations. Most users reported interest in this opportunity (4.3/5 on the Likert scale), found results useful/helpful (4.5), thought the device easy to use (4.9), and were likely to be re-screened (4.7). A majority (97.9%) recommended continuing to offer the screening.",

Among concerns for lactating G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood HPC donors is the unknown potential for harm to their child via ingestion of this potent growth factor during nursing. Only two studies have previously described the excretion of G-CSF in human milk, leaving the transplant community with limited information with which to make appropriate safety recommendations for nursing HPC donors. In this study, G-CSF levels were measured in a lactating G-CSF-mobilized HPC donor. Study Design/Method: Serial plasma and milk samples were collected from a volunteer peripheral blood HPC donor. The G-CSF concentration of each sample was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Results/Finding: Peak concentration of G-CSF in donor milk was at 592pg/ mL 48 hours after the first dose of G-CSF was given. G-CSF remained detectable in donor milk for 48 hours after the final dose of G-CSF. Conclusion: Compared to previous reports, a higher peak concentration of G-CSF in donor breast milk during mobilization was identified. Additionally, G-CSF was still detectable in breast milk 2 days after the last dose, the time at which even the most conservative guidelines would allow the donor to resume breastfeeding. This underscores the need to cautiously counsel lactating HPC donors regarding the presence of G-CSF in breast milk and the unknown risk this poses to the nursing infant.",

Study Design/Method: A National Health Insurance (NHI) program has been in place in Taiwan since 1995.Individualstransfused with RBC were identified and their disease diagnoses and surgical procedures were retrieved from NHI database, which comprised of information of more than 99% of blood transfused in the country. Results/Finding: A total of 306,980 persons were transfused with 1,074,934 red cell units, adjusted to 500 ml whole blood-derived RBC equivalent unit, in 19 medical centers, 76 metropolitan hospitals and 285 community hospitals and 187 clinics in 2015.Overall, 44.06% of RBC were transfused in medical centers, 55.85% were transfused in metropolitan and community hospitals and 0.88% transfused in clinics. A total of 45.6% of RBC units were transfused for medical indications, with 51.4% being transfused for surgical indications and 3.0% for obstetrics and gynecology. When compared to RBC transfusion in 2011, the transfused units for medical and obstetrics/gynecology remains steady over these years. The transfused units for surgical procedures was 4.5% decreased. Breakdown data showed Hematologic and oncologic disorders accounted for 16% and 13% of RBC transfusion, respectively. Gastrointestinal (14%), vascular (11%) and cardiothoracic surgery(10%) were also common indications for RBC transfusion. RBC usage varies between hospitals. Approximately 19% of RBC units were transfused for cancer patients in medical centers, but less than 10% were for cancer patients in metropolitan and community hospitals. On the other hand, a significantly higher percentage of RBC usage for gastrointestinal surgery and respiratory diseases was observed in metropolitan and community hospitals as compared to that in medical centers.

Thus, Hr-subjects are likely to develop alloantibodies, which have been responsible for hemolytic transfusion reactions or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Hrunits are very scarce because most donor testing reagents and procedures do not accurately screen them, as no antigenic weakening is commonly seen. We report the cases of 4 Hr-pregnant women with different antibody profiles and how the least incompatible units were selected for them. Study Design/Method: Standard hemagglutination and genomic techniques were used. Results/Finding: Patient 1 was at 22 weeks of pregnancy when fetal distress was reported. She was RHD*DAR/RHCE*ceAR homozygous and immunized with anti-Hr (only reactive in IAT-papain) and anti-hr S (titer 4). D--units were proposed for IUT but with a very high risk of anti-D immunization. Ten days later, due to the severe renal failure of the patient, the fetus died. To cover a post-partum hemorrhage, two options were possible: rr units, which would be incompatible in IAT, or R 2 R 2 units, which would only be incompatible in IAT-papain but without any prevention for anti-D immunization. The best scenario would have been r\"r\" but such units were not available when she delivered. Patient 2 was RHD*DAR/RHCE*ceAR homozygous and immunized with anti-D, anti-Hr, anti-hr S . At delivery their respective titer was 8, 1 and 256. rr and R 2 R 2 units were considered too reactive to be used. r\"r\" units were barely reactive. Passive antibodies found in the newborn were anti-D and anti-hr S . The baby did not harbor a partial D but was discovered to be HbS/S. R 2 R 2 or CEVF-(RH:-61) units were only reactive in IAT-papain. Even though r\"r\" units were non-reactive, in order to prevent an anti-E immunization, CEVF-units were considered to be the best option and easier to collect than D--units. Patient 3 had a normal D. At delivery of her 3 rd pregnancy, anti-hr S titrated 512 and anti-Hr was weakly reactive on untreated RBCs. R 2 R 2 units were selected for the mother and D--or the mother's blood were proposed for the newborn. Luckily no transfusion was needed. Two years later, she had a new pregnancy. At 8 th month, an emergency delivery was performed because of fetal distress. The anti-hr S titer was 512. At birth the hemoglobin was 7g/dL. An emergency transfusion was done with a fresh R 2 R 2 unit, followed by an exchange transfusion using the same phenotype. Patient 4 had a normal D. Her antibodies were anti-E, anti-c, anti-hr S and anti-Hr. Titers, performed on rr, R 1 R 1 and R 2 R 2 RBCs were 4096, 2048 and 8192 respectively. She had lost her 2 first newborns at 1 month and 1 week. She could not carry her last pregnancy to term. No other units than Hr-, D-or Rh null were suitable for transfusion. Conclusion: To transfuse Hr-immunized individuals when Hr-units are not available, the following phenotypes should be tested: D--, rr, R 2 R 2 , r\"r\", CEVF-or Rh null . Depending on the antibodies' strength, the clinical history and the availability of the units, the best alternative can be decided. A close cooperation with the clinical team is essential and has to be set up at the earliest stage of pregnancy. These cases illustrate the urgent need to implement more efficient procedures in donor testing to pick up Hr-units, as well as donor recruitment campaigns to target Hr-individuals.",

Serology based ABO typing and subtyping of the A blood type may not be informative when the patients have received pretransplant transfusions. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed the rapid, scalable methods for molecular determination of ABO blood types and A subtyping that may address limitations of serological methods and enable widespread adoption of subtyping in kidney transplantation. Study Design/Method: We developed a NGS based method that specifically amplifies or enriches sequences in exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene followed by short read sequencing using either HiSeq2500 or MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc.). The raw sequence data was processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline that allowed inference of the ABO blood types and the A subtype by combining the sequence information with population based frequencies for various alleles. The concordance between observed ABO genotypes and serology was determined using data from 41 individuals with matched ABO genotype/serology information and the concordance of the A subtyping was determined using data from 85 individuals with matched A1 subtype genotype/serology information Results/Finding: Both exons 6 and 7 were completely sequenced using the custom NGS based assay. We observed 100% concordance between ABO genotypes and corresponding serology in 41 individuals. Unambiguous genotypes for A subtyping was available in 89% of cases (76/85). In all these cases, the A1 allele could not be unambiguously distinguished from the A2 allele. Eight of these cases were serotype as \"non-A1\" while one case was serotyped as A1. Combining sequencing data with information from public databases allowed us to successfully infer genotypes in all 85 cases. The concordance among patients with unambiguous A subtypes was 95% (45/49) with four discrepant cases. In two cases, patients with an A1 allele were identified as \"non-A1\" by serology while in two cases serology indicated an A1 subtype when no A1 allele was identified by genotyping.",

Directly upstream from the CYBB gene is the XK gene, which encodes the Kx transmembrane protein on red blood cells. Loss of the Kx protein greatly reduces expression of the Kell system antigens and is referred to as the McLeod (MLD) phenotype. MLD neuroacanthocytosis syndrome includes chronic anemia and late onset neuromuscular complications.

Study Design/Method: Anti-k and anti-Kp b were of pooled human sera. A regional tiled genomic PCR strategy was used to detect large regional X chromosome deletions. Published X-chromosome primers (Gassner et al. 2017) were used to amplify 16 genomic PCR targets spanning a 2.8 mbp region of Xp21.1 containing the CYBB and XK genes, followed by finemapping using a step-wise custom primer strategy. Results/Finding: Both brother's red blood cells were found to be weakly reactive with Cellano and Kp b antisera. Contiguous PCR amplicons failed to amplify consistent with a large deletion.

Kutner 1 and Lilian Castilho 2 . 1 Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, 2 Hemocentro Unicamp Background/Case Studies: Appropriate classification of RhD phenotypes is crucial for correct indication of anti-D immunoglobulin (RhIG) in pregnant women. The serological distinction between weak D and partial D phenotypes is often doubtful and makes genetic analysis of the RHD gene highly recommended in pregnant women. In addition to properly define the RhD phenotype, one of the important aspects in maternal medicine is to predict whether the RhD variants can alloimmunize or not the pregnant woman in order to indicate the appropriate use of anti-D RhIG. Based on this, we analyzed the RHD gene in a cohort of pregnant women from a multi-ethnic population of Southeast Brazil with a serologic weak D phenotype and evaluated the implication of each D variant found with alloimmunization. Study Design/Method: We selected a total of 40 prenatal patients samples from 3916 samples that showed a weak reactivity in D typing routine. The D antigen expression was evaluated by tube and gel hemagglutination with four monoclonal anti-D reagents. Laboratory-developed DNA tests (LDTs), RHD BeadChip (Bioarray Solutions, Immucor) and sequencing were used to identify the RHD alleles. Results/Finding: There was no standard serologic reactivity identified, which could predict what type of D variant would be identified but agglutination varied from 1 + to 3+. Molecular analyses showed that 36 (90%) pregnant women were RHD*weak D type 4.0 and potentially at risk for anti-D and 4 (10%) were RHD*weak D types 1, 2 or 3 and not at risk for anti-D. Most of the patients had previously gestations with no anti-D Ig prophylaxis and all patients showed a negative antibody screening in this follow up. Conclusion: Our results show that weak D type 4.0 is by far the most frequent type (90%) of D variant in this selected prenatal patients of a multiethnic population with serologic weak D phenotype. According to the literature, these obstetric patients are at risk for anti-D and candidates for RhIG. According to our results, using RHD genotyping, we could prevent unnecessary injections of RhIG in only 10% of the pregnant women with a serologic weak D phenotype. However, no anti-D immunization was observed in our cohort of pregnant women with weak D type 4.0, even in those who did not use RhIG in the previous gestation.",

Conclusion: Although the most common hrB-and the (C)ce S alleles associated with RH genotype match requests are not uncommon in our donors, the ability to identify units to fill the transfusion requests is challenging. Filling requests for hrS-units is specially challenging as this phenotype is much less frequent in our donors. The development of a strategy to screen more donors and to optimize the identification of donors with RH variant alleles is critical to support our SCD patients with RH genotype matched units.",

They cause panreactivity of Reagent Red Blood Cells (RRBC), which complicates the detection of underlying allo-antibodies of potential clinical relevance. At the moment there are few strategies to overcome this problem, however with several drawbacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic use of a novel recombinant CD38 with particular emphasis on dilution effects of this soluble CD38 (sCD38) on detection of unexpected antibodies. Study Design/Method: A fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of CD38 was expressed in mammalian cells and purified as sCD38. For evaluation of diagnostic functionality, anti-CD38 spiked donor plasma (containing allo-antibodies or not) were mixed with varying volumes/concentrations of sCD38 (or PBS as control) and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Antibody detection was then performed by Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT) in conventional tube technique or DG Gel technique. Results/Finding: A ratio of 2 \u03bcl and 4 \u03bcl of recombinant sCD38 at nominal concentration of $30mg/ml per 25 \u03bcl of plasma, allowed for complete inhibition of anti-CD38 (respectively 0.5mg/ml and 1mg/ml). After inhibition, spiked allo-antibodies (anti-D, -E, -c, -Cw, -K, -Fya, -Jka, -S, -s, -M, -Lua, -Cob) at barely detectable amounts into DARA-spiked donor plasma could be readily detected in 16/16 samples. In contrast, as demonstrated in DG Gel technique, after incubation with 20 \u03bcl and 200 \u03bcl of diluted preparations of sCD38, respectively 15/16 and 3/16 of the same simulated DARA plasma spiked with antibodies could still be detected.",

Additionally, these data confirm that successful neutralization and subsequent antibody detection requires highly concentrated sCD38. After neutralization, the plasma can be screened with available routine techniques, such as tube and gel technique. Enabling complete anti-CD38 inhibition, while minimally diluting the plasma with sCD38, the highly concentrated sCD38 presented in this work may provide, in combination with IAT, a rapid and accurate screening and identification method of even weakly reacting allo-antibodies masked by anti-CD38. On the other hand, Glycophorin E (GPE) is not expressed on erythrocyte membranes. The glycophorin family genes called GYPA, GYPB, and GYPE are located on chromosome 4 and have a high homology to each other. Normal M antigen is sensitive to protease, but some protease-resistant M antigens (PRM) are identified such as St a (GP.Zan) and En(a-)UK. In 1991, Kikuchi and Uchikawa et al. reported a novel PRM with a low molecular weight. In this study, we performed immunochemical, serologic, and molecular genetic analysis of the novel PRM antigen, and confirmed that PRM was present on GP(E-B) hybrid molecule. Study Design/Method: PRM screening of 193,009 blood donors was performed at Japanese Red Cross Kanto Koshinetsu block blood center from June to November 2015.

Flow cytometric analysis of S/s antigens on RBCs was performed with polyclonal anti-S and anti-s. To identify the molecular mechanism for the novel PRM antigen, reticulocyte mRNA and genomic DNA from a PRM-positive donor were analyzed by PCR and cloning followed by sequencing. Genomic fragment spanning from M-specific sequence in exon 2 to downstream of exon B5, and upstream of exon B1 to downstream of exon E3 were amplified from gDNA by PCR, and sequence it. Background/Case Studies: ABO typing of recipients and donors is important for optimal transfusion and transplant outcomes. Although, serologic ABO typing is highly reliable, it can be limited by discordant forward and reverse typing. In addition, living solid organ and stem cell donor evaluations often only involve a buccal swab, preventing upfront serologic ABO typing. A combination of DNA based genotyping solutions can be used to help resolve serologic ABO discordances as well as screen transplant donors for ABO, but these methods are labor-intensive and require interpretation by subject matter experts. We sought to develop a targeted ABO next generation sequencing (NGS) assay, along with companion interpretive software, for automated data processing and ABO typing for known ABO alleles. Study Design/Method: Targeted long range PCR based DNA enrichment of the ABO gene was achieved by evaluating a series of PCR primer combinations using both blood and buccal swab isolated DNA. The PCR products were run on agarose gel and Agilent bioanalyzer to determine product size and quality. Promising PCR products then underwent Illumina TruSight NGS library preparation and sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq. Investigators previously created a curated allele database (http://bloodantigens.com) and custom bloodTyper interpretive software to determine blood groups from whole genome sequencing data. These previous efforts were improved upon by further curating the ABO alleles and by adding NGS sequence read based cis/trans phasing to the bloodTyper software to determine full ABO allele haplotypes. Results/Finding: PCR primer evaluation showed reproducible PCR products spanning ABO exons 2-7 in blood samples and 6-7 for buccal swabs, which yielded good quality NGS data. These exons encode the major ABO specificities including ABO subtypes (A2, Ax, B3, weak antigens (Aw, Ael), and hybrid alleles (cisAB, B(A)). To verify the ABO NGS assay, a combination of 100 blood and buccal swab samples were tested and found to be 100% concordant with serologic ABO typing and Sanger sequencing of weak, subtype, and hybrid allele samples. We found that in most cases that targeted ABO NGS results could be fully resolved to a cis/trans phased genotyping allowing for unambiguous allele determination by the interpretative software.",

Current laboratory methods used to resolve complex cases such as; multiple antibodies, antibodies to high frequency antigens or antibodies that are high titre low avidity (HTLA) in nature can be cumbersome. These investigations require a great deal of operator expertise and may lead to delays in the provision of suitable red cell units for transfusion. Previous studies involving rBGPs have shown their significant potential in reducing turnaround times for antibody investigation and subsequent provision of red cell units for patients with complex antibodies. This study evaluates the usefulness of rBGP in a RCI laboratory. Study Design/Method: 43 samples containing complex antibodies were tested using the appropriate rBGP (imusyn). The inhibition assay was used as per manufacturer's instructions. Plasma was incubated with rBGPs to inhibit specific antibodies to the cognate blood group antigen.

Hemochromatosis is an inherited iron storage disorder that increases the risk of developing iron overload as mutations in the HFE (\"high-Fe\") gene impair the molecular mechanism for removing excess iron. While thalassemia patients are routinely characterized for mutations in the HBB gene encoding beta-globin, screening for HFE mutations currently is not part of the \"work-up\". To explore the prevalence of HFE mutations in chronically transfused pediatric and adolescent thalassemia patients in Pakistan, we evaluated DNA profiles for HBB and HFE gene mutations, with the objective of improving thalassemia patient management. Study Design/Method: 155 pediatric and adolescent \u03b2-thalassemia patients treated at the Afzal Memorial Thalassemia Foundation (AMTF) hospital were screened, in a single assay, using a novel LeanSequencing process developed at BioMolecular Analytics. Our panel included a set of thalassemia (-619 bp deletion, cd 8/9 + G, IVS1-1 G>T, IVS1-1 G>A, IVS1-5 G>C, 41/42 -TTCT, IVS1-6 T>C, -88 C>T, -29 A>G, and IVS1-110 G>A), sickle cell (Hb S, C and E) and hemochromatosis (HFE C282Y, H63D, S65C) mutations. Duplicate barcoded buccal swab samples were collected and crude extract was prepared without any DNA purification (Patel, et al., 2017) . Crude extract was amplified in a multiplexed PCR reaction for both HBB and HFE genes and analyzed by LeanSequencing. We also analyzed the same group of patients for an extended set of red blood cell antigens, and present those data elsewhere in these proceedings. Results/Finding: 5% of patients were homozygous, and 28% were heterozygous, for HFE mutation H63D; all were normal for C282Y and S65C. As to HBB, IVS1-5 G>C was the most common mutation in this group (33% homozygous, 9.6% compound heterozygous with mostly codon 8/9 + G, IVSI 1 G>T and Hb E); also common was codon 8/9 + G (22.4% homozygous, 12% compound heterozygous with, IVS1-5 G>C, IVS1-1 G>T or 41/42 -TTCT); 3.2% patients identified with -619 bp deletion, and 6% homozygous and 1% heterozygous for 41/42 -TTCT; 2 % of the patients were \"compound het\" for the Hb E sickle cell mutation; all patients were normal for Hb S and Hb C mutations. Conclusion: HFE gene mutations are not uncommon in Pakistani thalassemia patients. The routine screening for these mutations would provide additional input in designing individualized proactive transfusion therapies, especially for pediatric patients, namely by routinely providing cells selected in accordance with the patients' extended rbc antigen profiles: to minimize the risk of alloimmunization, and by reducing the prevalence of this condition, which has been reported to increase the frequency of transfusion, to likewise reduce the risk of iron overload.

We investigated JK in a donor with a Jk b serologic discordance between current and historical type and in a patient with Jk(a\u2212) phenotype differed from Jk(a+) prediction by DNA. Study Design/Method: RBC typing was performed by standard tube methods with monoclonal anti-Jk a (clone MS15) and -Jk b (clone MS8). Genomic DNA was isolated from WBCs. HEA PreciseType was performed for the patient. JK coding exons were amplified and sequenced. Results/Finding: Sample 1 was from a South Asian male donor. RBCs on the current donation typed Jk(b+) but historical records indicated Jk(b\u2212). By tube testing, his RBCs were weakly reactive with Immucor anti-Jk b and non-reactive with Bio-Rad Seraclone anti-Jk b . RBCs also were Jk(a+). From sequence results, the sample was heterozygous for c.838G>A (p. Asp280Asn), predicting Jk(a+b+). In addition, a novel change, c.998T>C that encodes p.Val333Ala was identified. The c.998C change by Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) is rare with a frequency of 0.003% (rs774982134). Sample 2 was from a 76 year old Caucasian female patient.

JK sequencing of exon 9 confirmed JK*A/*B, but also revealed a novel change, c.935C>A (p.Ala312Asp), which was not found in the dbSNP or ExAc databases. Sequencing with SNP-specific primers linked the new change to JK*A. JK*A with c.935C>A was identified in a patient whose RBCs typed Jk(a\u2212) with multiple reagents. The Ala312Asp is predicted to be located in the transmembrane (T4b) [Ramsey et al, 2017 Transfusion 57(3)] and its impact on protein expression is difficult to predict. The sample was insufficient for adsorption/elution studies to determine if the allele encodes a Jk a null phenotype or low level of Jk a antigen.

Bensing 2 , Michael Schanen 2 , Cindy Piefer 2 , Madeline Knier 2 , Emily Roeger 2 and Gregory A. Denomme 2,3 . Background/Case Studies: The identification of Group A2 solid organs by evaluating red blood cells (RBCs) allows ABO incompatible (ABOi) transplants to Group O and B recipients. The A2 classification is determined using anti-A1 lectin manufactured from an extract of Dolichos bifloris seeds, which is diluted to differentiate human Group A1 RBCs from non-A1 subgroups. Weak reactivity can be observed with RBCs using either of two FDA-licensed reagents. The manufacturers of these reagents state that weak reactions can occur with A2 or A2B RBCs. To understand the implications of weak anti-A1 lectin RBC typing and an A2 subgroup classification, we evaluated the incidence of weak hemagglutination with two licensed anti-A1 lectin reagents, and the associated ABO alleles using genomic DNA sequencing of exons 6 and 7. Study Design/Method: Anti-A1 lectin typing was performed using two licensed reagents in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols and validated using known A1 and A2 reagent RBCs. Weak reactivity was defined as \u22641 + hemagglutination with either anti-A1 lectin reagent. All samples were ABO grouped using standard licensed antisera and A1 and B RBCs. Genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to ABO exons 6 and 7 sequencing using intron flanking primers for exon 6 and two overlapping fragments for exon 7. Standard Sanger dideoxy sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3. ; 1061delC) could be ruled out given none of the samples were weakly reactive with a licensed anti-A. Thus, three ABO*A2 alleles could be assigned from the sequence data: 15 ABO*A2.01, one ABO*A2.06, and one ABO*A2.09. The ABO*A2 alleles were paired with 10 ABO*O01, one ABO*02 or ABO*O13, one ABO*011, one ABO*026, one ABO*O44, and three unassigned ABO*O alleles. The controls consisted of three Group A donors with RBCs having 4 + hemagglutination, along with two Group A donors and one AB donor with RBCs that were nonreactive when tested using both anti-A1 lectins. Sequencing the control samples revealed a three consensus ABO*A1.01, three ABO*A2.01, and one ABO*B1.01. Conclusion: Weak equivocal results with anti-A1 lectin are relatively common among donors. Analysis of ABO exons 6 and 7 sequencing data revealed that ABO*A2.01 is the most common allele, but did not reveal nucleotide changes associated with weak anti-A1 lectin reactivity. Weak reactivity with anti-A1 lectin is linked to other ABO*A2 alleles; namely ABO*A2.06 and ABO*A2.09 in this small survey. The expression of Group A carbohydrate chains among ABO*A2 alleles has not been systematically evaluated. Acute rejection of an ABO*O2.06 kidney in an ABOi recipient suggests that additional biochemical studies are warranted.",

Three single-site mutations in ITGB3 genes, 1333G>A, 1476G>A, and 1813G>A were identified in our lab, which caused Val419Met, Trp466-stop, and Gly579Ser substitution, respectively.

In this study, recombinant expression plasmids of wild-type GPIIIa and the three variants were constructed in vitro, the recombinant protein were extracted and coupled to Luminex beads to test platelet antibodies using Luminex xMAP technology to determine whether the three point mutations of ITGB3 have effect on HPA antigenicity. Study Design/Method: Full-length cDNA of wild-type, 1333G>A, 1476G>A, and 1813G>A ITGB3 were amplified and ligated into pcDNA3.1 vector.

Results/Finding: Western blot analysis revealed that the established CHO-1333G>A and CHO-1813G>A cell lines expressed GPIIIa molecules having the same molecular weight as WT, while the similarly protein was not identified in CHO-1476G>A cell because of its premature stop mutation. The Luminex MFIs showed that the three beads coupled with GPIIIa proteins (WT, 1333G>A and 1813G>A), respectively, exhibited similar results when reacting with same sarum, which implied that the new mutation of 1333G>A and 1813G>A did not affect the antigenicity of HPAs.

When an automated 3-cell SPRCA screen was panreactive or < 3 + with 1 or 2 of the screening cell samples, the antibody screen (ABSC) was repeated in polyethylene glycol (PEG) tube if the patient had no history of antibodies. If the PEG ABSC was negative, the ABSC was interpreted as negative; the patient may be eligible for computer crossmatch compatible blood. The risk of moving to PEG tube testing is the failure to identify an antibody reactive only in SPRCA. This study quantified how often this workflow was used and antibody detection failures and their consequences. Study Design/Method: Retrospective review of ABSC results was performed from January 2016 through December 2017. SPRCA was performed with the Immucor Ready Screen (Norcross, Ga, USA). Results corrected to a negative PEG ABSC were identified and reviewed for antibody identification (AB ID) in subsequent antibody screens. Clinically insignificant allo-and autoantibodies were excluded. Details of further immunohematology workups were collected, including transfusion reactions. Direct antiglobulin tests (DAT) and acid eluates were tested by tube and PEG tube method, respectively. Results/Finding: Out of 161971 ABSC performed, 857 negative PEG ABSC were identified. New antibodies were found in 130 samples (15.2% of PEG ABSC). Twenty seven patients with 31 new significant alloantibodies (3.2% of PEG ABSC) were identified. Anti-Jk a was the most commonly detected antibody (Table 1) . Twenty-three (74%) of these antibodies were detected within 4 weeks of the initial corrected PEG ABSC. Eleven patients received RBC transfusion between corrected result and new AB ID. At the time of AB ID, 6 had DAT results, 3 of which were positive. Acid eluates were negative for all 3 positive DATs. One delayed transfusion reaction was identified out of the 27 patients; however the transfusion preceded a positive SPRCA screen. Conclusion: The workflow to defer to PEG ABSC missed 3.2% of clinically significant alloantibodies. The serologic and clinical consequences were rare as transfusions were infrequent between initial corrected screen and the detection of alloantibody. The benefit of the workflow was labor and supply savings for the 826 positive SPCRA screens where no significant antibody was identified. To address concerns of missed antibodies, the threshold for moving to PEG ABSC was adjusted to results < 2 + with 1 or 2 cell samples in SPRCA screening.",

The frequency, timing of detection, persistence, and description of clinical outcomes in the presence of these antibodies has not been reported. Study Design/Method: A single center, retrospective review of all lung transplant recipients with anti-A1 antibodies from January 2015 to December 2017 was performed. All available, relevant clinical, pathologic, transfusion, and serologic data were collected from the electronic medical record. Results/Finding: Four recipients with anti-A1 were identified among 297 total lung transplants. A description of patient and procedural characteristics of the four recipients can be seen in Table 1 . The lung allocation scores ranged from 27-76 d. All recipients were ABO Type A2, RhD+, and one had an additional anti-I cold agglutinin. Lung donor ABO types were A1 (2), A, and O. Anti-A1 was present before transplant in 2/4 and after transplant in 2/4 recipients. The persistence and strength of the anti-A1 in the recipients varied greatly (Table 1) . Intraoperative transfusion support was minimal for three patients (3, 3, and 0 total products); the fourth required massive resuscitation with >100 products Two patients were treated for suspected humoral rejection; one for new donor-specific HLA antibodies and one empirically based on radiologic and spirometric findings. The length of stay ranged from 21-80 d. On transbronchial biopsies, two patients had acute cellular rejection (ACR) on a single biopsy (one A1B1R, one A1B0), one patient had two A1BX biopsies, and one patient had no ACR. With follow-up ranging 6-23 mo., all patients are living and all grafts are viable. Conclusion: Lung transplant across the A1/A2 blood group mismatch occurs on occasion, and the appearance of an anti-A1 antibody prior to or after transplant does not appear correlated with graft dysfunction, cellular, or antibodymediated rejection in this case series. The patient with the strongest, most persistent anti-A1 antibody titers required massive transfusion, but also had a cold agglutinin and active infection. Longer follow-up in larger, multicenter trials is needed to better understand outcomes and anti-A1 titers for confirmation.",

En(a-) RBCs have decreased sialic acid and loss of Wr b expression on GPA-band 3. Anti-En a can cause hemolysis of allogeneic RBCs. En(a-) donors are extremely rare worldwide and additional genetic information is highly desirable. Study Design/Method: Serological tests were performed by routine methods. DNA-based blood group phenotyping employed the Precise-Type\u2122 HEA (Immucor, Norcross, GA). GYPA was analyzed by long-range amplification and sequencing of exons 2-7. Results/Finding: A 59-yo woman was evaluated for a history of broad RBC incompatibility at age 14 at cholecystectomy and at age 36 with uterine hemorrhage after miscarriage of her only pregnancy. She was never transfused. She was born in Lahore, Pakistan, but her parents were remote cousins from Allahabad, India. She was group B, D + with plasma pan-reactivity in solidphase (4+), polyethylene glycol (3 + anti-IgG), low-ionic saline solution (1 + 37C, 3 + anti-IgG), and ficin-RBC (2 + 37C, 3 + anti-IgG) methods. Direct antiglobulin test was negative. Her RBCs phenotyped as M\u2212N\u2212S\u2212s+, En(a\u2212), Wr(a\u2212b\u2212) and were reactive with Glycine soja lectin indicating reduced sialic acid. Her plasma was nonreactive to En(a\u2212) RBCs, consistent with anti-En a FR (ficin-resistant). In the En(a-) literature, a Pakistani-born US patient was reported in 1995 (Immunohematol 11:51). Demographics, serology, extended RBC phenotypes, published history and patient discussion confirmed she was the subject of that report. RBC GPA was not detected by human or monoclonal antisera or by immunoblotting at that time, but genetics were not done. In our testing, HEA interrogation of GYPA exon 2 c.59 C>T predicted her phenotype was Background/Case Studies: Most ABO subgroups express A or B antigens weakly on RBCs and are due to inherited alterations in the ABO gene, affecting either the efficacy, specificity or concentration of the A/B glycosyltransferase. Here, we report the investigation of ABO in a patient from Ukraine who showed a suspected mixed-field appearance with dual populations of RBCs upon testing with anti-B in routine serology. Study Design/Method: Flow cytometric analysis and routine ABO genotyping including analysis of the upstream CBF/NF-Y-binding enhancer region (involved in determining transcription rate in certain tissues) was carried out. Further genetic analysis was performed by DNA sequencing of ABO exons 1-7 (including 50 base pairs of the adjacent introns) and the proximal promoter. ABSTRACT Results/Finding: DNA analysis showed that the patient's genotype was ABO*B.01/O.01.10, which is normally consistent with group B. Sequence analysis of all ABO exons did not reveal any unexpected changes in the coding sequence to explain the weak phenotype and PCR analysis of the upstream CBF/NF-Y-binding enhancer region showed homozygosity for the expected four 43-bp repeats consistent with the genotype. However, sequencing of the ABO promoter unravelled a substitution of G to A at position \u221272. Flow cytometric analysis showed no expression of A and normal H antigen levels but a biphasic, chimera-like pattern was observed with anti-B, although cells with an intermediate level of antigen expression were also present. This type of pattern has previously been reported for the A 3 subgroup caused by mutations in the regulatory region located in intron 1. Investigation of the parents' DNA showed that the mother was ABO (3) extended matching including RHD and RHCE variant alleles. Considering the total of red blood cell units requested for each patient and a number of 2 donations per year for the compatible donors, we are fulfilling the needs of patients in level 1 of matching and for most of patients in level 2 but when we considered RH variants it has been much more difficult to find compatible donors for patients with SCD. Besides of the challenges to fulfill all the requests with multiple negative antigens and RH matching units, the cost effectiveness of those practices to minimize the risk of alloimmunization remains controversial, partly because not all patients develop alloantibodies despite extensive exposure to donor RBC antigens. In order to optimize the use of genotype-matched units to our patients we have genotyped the patients for genetic markers that could potentially help in the classification of responder and non-responder SCD patients. In this study we evaluated the ability of this practice to avoid production of RBC antibodies and the negative consequences of alloimmunization in a follow up of 2 years. Study Design/Method: A total of 27 non-alloimmunized patients with SCD, homozygous for HbS, receiving a range of 15-398 RBC units were enrolled in this study. Nine patients have the cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNFA-308A, IL1B-511T) previously associated with risk of alloimmunization and are being transfused with extended matching RBC units (level 2 of matching), 7 patients with RHAG 808A gene polymorphism previously associated with risk of RH aloimmunization and 8 patients with no genetic risk factors associated with RBC alloimmunization are being transfused with RH and K matching units ( Conclusion: Although some patients developed antibodies against low prevalence antigens and one patient developed anti-Fy-3, this practice has improved the ability to find antigen-matched components for transfusion support in non-alloimmunized patients and has been of benefit to patients, as observed by the lack in the development of common alloantibodies. Transfusion follow up during two years showed that this transfusion strategy was efficient to keep the patient's Hb baseline levels.",

Asian man, not recently transfused, presented with chronic anemia, dyspnea and an antibody that reacted with all panel cells but not with Jk(a-b-) RBCs or the autologous control. His RBCs typed Jk(a-b-) and his plasma contained an apparent anti-Jk3. Testing was done to further investigate the plasma reactivity and to determine his JK genotype. Study Design/Method: Antibody identification and antigen typing were performed by standard methods with licensed and in-house reagents. Eluates were made with Gamma Elu-Kit II (Immucor). Genomic DNA was isolated from WBCs. HEA PreciseType was performed and the JK coding exons were amplified and sequenced. Eluates made from the first set of RBCs used for adsorption reacted with Jk(a+) and Jk(b+) RBCs and thus contained an apparent anti-Jk3. Surprisingly, Jk(a+ W b-) RBCs from 2 donors, 1 homozygous for JK*01W.01 and 1 with JK*01W.01/ 02N.01, were weakly incompatible (1+) with patient's plasma by PEG IAT. Conclusion: We describe a patient with a partial Jk a , detectable only by adsorption/elution, encoded by a novel JK*01(130A,557G) in trans to silenced Jk b encoded by JK*02N.01. The initial plasma reactivity was consistent with anti-Jk3 but by adsorption it was shown to contain separable anti-Jk a and -Jk b and, based on eluate results, a third antibody specificity non-reactive with only Jk(a-b-) Jk3-RBCs. As the patient's RBCs express low levels of Jk a , it suggests the antibody is not anti-Jk3. The incompatibility of the patient's plasma with RBCs from donors that express Jk a encoded by JK*01W.01, c.130A (p.44Lys), shows there is a recognizable difference between the protein encoded by that allele and the new JK*01(130A,577G) encoding both p.44Lys and p.186Arg. We show that the availability of JK genotyped RBCs enables more precise determination of antibody specificity to inform transfusion practice. ",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: ABO is arguably the most important blood group system in transfusion medicine. Laboratories typically use serological methods to perform ABO typing. However, serology has significant limitations including (i) recently transfused patients may exhibit mixed field agglutination wherein both the patient's and recent donor's antigens are detected, and (ii) both forward and reverse typing must be performed, but may yield discordant results. These limitations are most problematic with phenotypes involving weakly expressed antigens. Laboratories can overcome these drawbacks with a combination of genotyping solutions (SSP, sequencing, etc), but these methods are time-and labor-consuming, and require interpretation by subject matter experts. The aim of this study was to evaluate an alternative ABO real-time PCR based genotyping solution recently introduced by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Study Design/Method: The Thermo Fisher Scientific solution is based on its LinkS eq real-time PCR technology, which was developed over 10 years ago for genotyping the complex Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. LinkS eq ABO analyzes 19 reactions that identify multiple relevant SNPs located within the ABO gene. We evaluated this solution by analyzing 96 archived DNA samples, including blood blank samples for which serotyping failed or produced discordant results, and samples from deceased solid organ donors. Results/Finding: Genotyping results generated by LinkS eq were 100% concordant with typing obtained by traditional methodologies. In several cases, serology did provide conclusive results including: five discordant serologic and six inderminant A1 lectin reactions. In all of these cases LinkS eq was able to provide conclusive results, in agreement with Sanger sequencing results where available. LinkS eq overcomes the major challenges of molecular typing by providing a robust, automated approach that increases laboratory productivity and reduces turn-around time. With less than 10 minutes of hands-on set-up, no further operator intervention with reagents, and SureTyper\u2122 software fully automating all analysis, LinkS eq delivers genotyping and predicted phenotyping results in approximately 90 minutes. Conclusion: We conclude that LinkS eq can provide a simple, effective and robust method for ABO typing including accurate A2 subgrouping.",

Study Design/Method: Our patient is a 58 year old female with a history of B-cell lymphoma, status post allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant in October 2017, admitted to the hospital with a 7.0 g/dL hemoglobin. Patient had a previous history of cold and warm autoantibodies. A panagglutinin using gel technology was detected at the hospital and the sample was sent to the immunohematology reference laboratory for a complete workup. Transfusion history and medications were not initially available. Initial testing with gel showed a reverse ABO discrepancy, panagglutinin, and negative DAT. Tube testing using PeG, LISS, and enzymes was selected to continue the identification. Strong agglutination (3-4+) strength was seen at IS and AGT using all reagents. Patient plasma was tested against cells treated with Ficin, DTT, glycine acid-EDTA, cord cells, aged cells, and a battery of rare cells based on patient race and antibody reactivity. All reactions were 3-4 + against all cells tested. Though the DAT was negative, an eluate was performed to identify autoantibody. It demonstrated a panagglutinin. Titration of the plasma versus a phenotypically matched cell showed reactivity greater than 4096. An alloabsorption using human stroma (ficin-treated) was performed and the panagglutinin was removed, resolving the ABO discrepancy. Four cold/ alloabsorptions removed all reactivity at IS. Reactivity remained when tested at 37C/AGT. Additional alloabsorptions performed at 37C (x4) removed the remaining reactivity when tested with IgG Coombs. Results/Finding: The above results suggest a potent antibody to a high frequency antigen. With this in mind, several tests were performed using cells with rare phenotypes. When a complete history was obtained, it was found the patient had been in a clinical trial for a monoclonal antibody therapy targeting CD47. A literature review of the antibody identified a specific IgG Coombs sera clone is required to resolve the reactivity. If a clone lacking anti-IgG4 is used (Gamma clone, monoclonal), the cells which previously reacted 3-4 + with a clone containing IgG4 no longer react. Antibody testing was successfully completed using Gamma clone anti-IgG sera at AGT, omitting the IS and 37C phase. ABO testing was completed with x4 cold alloabsorbed stroma. Conclusion: Additional monoclonal therapies will continue to emerge. This case highlights the need for extensive communication between the Blood Bank and the clinical service regarding the use of these treatments.",

Given that TRANSFUSION 2018 Vol. 58 Supplement S2 ABSTRACT hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a disease managed with IFN therapy, we hypothesized that IFN-treated patients with HCV may have an elevated rate of RBC alloimmunization.

Study Design/Method: Alloimmunized subjects (n=214) were extracted from a pre-existing database; each subject was queried in the electronic medical record for a history of HCV infection and, if such a history was reported, then the following was subsequently collected: evidence of IFN therapy, RBC antibody specificities, and sex.

The most common, and usually the most severe cases of FNAIT are caused by anti-HPA-1a. HPA-1a negative women who give birth to an HPA-1a positive child are at risk of becoming HPA-1a-immunized. Women who are HLA-DRB3*01:01 positive have a higher risk of HPA-1aimmunization as compared to women lacking this HLA allele. The aim of the study was to estimate the risk of HPA-1a-immunization in both HPA-1a negative/HLA-DRB3*01:01 positive and HPA-1a negative/HLA-DRB3*01:01 negative women after giving birth to an HPA-1a positive child. Study Design/Method: A literature search was conducted which identified 10 prospective FNAIT studies. The risk of becoming HPA-1a-immunised postpartum was calculated by using Bayes' Theorem as no single trial contained all the needed information. Data were also used from the PRE-VFNAIT studya recently completed large prospective FNAIT study in Poland. The results of HLA-DRB3/4/5 typing of 212,472 European Caucasians from the National Marrow Donor Program were used as estimate of the frequency of the HLA-DRB3*01:01 allele in the general population. Results/Finding: In women who are HPA-1a-negative and HLA-DRB3*01:01 positive the risk of HPA-1a-immunisation after delivery of an HPA-1a positive child was estimated to 12.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.4% -16.5%). In contrast, the estimated immunization risk was only 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2% -1.1%) in women who are HPA-1a negative and HLA-DRB3*01:01 negative. Conclusion: In women who are HPA-1a negative and HLA-DRB3*01:01 positive, the risk of HPA-1a-immunization is 12.4% (95% CI: 8.4% -16.5%) after delivery of an HPA-1a positive child, which is 20 times higher than in women who are both HPA-1a and HLA-DRB3*01:01 negative. Thus, the risk of HPA-1a-immunization in HPA-1a negative/HLA-DRB3*01:01 positive women is in the same range as the risk of RhD-immunization in RhD negative women after delivery of an RhD positive child if the mother does not receive RhD prophylaxis.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Serologic weak D testing for patients is optional. However, in 2014 a work group between the College of American Pathologists and the AABB recommended that RHD genotyping (RHD-g) be performed when discordant serologic RhD typing results are encountered and/or when a serologic weak D is identified. The goal is identification of true candidates for RhIG injections and/or RhD negative RBCs. In 2015 our institution adopted a testing process by which RhD testing is performed by two methods (gel and tube) to identify serologic discrepancy and hence, candidates for RHD-g. It had been previously concluded that this process had a positive predictive value of 98% in detecting D variants. However, the cost-efficacy of RHD-g is not yet established. We sought to evaluate the cost efficacy of molecular RHD-g at our institution. Study Design/Method: Results of RHD-g performed between 07/2015 -12/2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' age, gender, race, clinical presentation, use of RhIG injection and transfusion were also reviewed. Cost analysis was performed. Results/Finding: During the analyzed period 33,784 types and screens were performed at our blood bank. Only 130 (0.4%) samples, of which 102 were included in our study, were sent for RHD-g due to serologic discrepancy and were initially resulted as RhD negative. The majority of patients (79.4%) typed as partial D and their type was kept as RhD negative. The remaining (20.6%) typed as weak D or no D variant and were changed to RhD positive, of which 4 patients were transfused subsequently. Twenty out of 102 patients were pregnant, of which 13 received RhIG (cost $80/vial). See Table for demographics. Of the 13 patients who received RhIG, 4 were unnecessary (2 weak D, 2 D+), which would have saved approximately $640 assuming at least 2 vials/patient. The cost of molecular sendouts was approximately $450/test, for a total cost of $45,900 for patients included in our study. The cost of RhD negative and positive pRBC units from our supplier was the same ($201/unit).",

As human platelet concentrates (HPC) are used to adsorb HLA antibody, and CD47 is present on platelets, we report a novel use of HPC to adsorb anti-CD47. Study Design/Method: Samples were received in November 2017 (Postdrug day 1), March 2018 (Post-drug day 3), and April 2018 (Post-drug day 15) from a 54 year-old female with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in Phase Ib clinical trial of Hu5F9-G4 and rituximab. Historic blood type was A positive with negative antibody screens, 2 pregnancies and transfusions in 2009 and 2010. Samples were screened with commercial reagent cells, at Immediate Spin (IS), 37C, and AHG with LISS, at AHG with PEG and at AHG saline with 60-minute 37C incubation. Except for IS reactions, all components were prewarmed for 30 minutes at 37C before mixing. Following the HPC direction insert procedure, but using the available plasma samples, we performed sequential adsorptions, and evaluated for reactivity at prewarmed PEG AHG. Patient sample spiked with Jk a antiserum was HPC adsorbed to verify expected alloantibody reactivity. Results/Finding: The first sample was forward type A positive consistent with historical data, but reversed as type O (4 + with both A1 and B cells). Autocontrol (AC) and direct anti-globulin test (DAT) were negative. Antibody screen was reactive at IS (2+), negative at AHG using Gamma-clone anti-IgG, and her serologic phenotype was obtained. The second sample showed similar ABO, DAT and AC results, but screening was reactive at IS (4+), LISS 37C (w+), and PEG AHG (m + to 1+) despite use of Gammaclone AHG. Three HPC adsorptions successfully removed reactivity at AHG, but not at IS. The third sample had the same ABO, DAT, and AC results, but AHG-phase testing was diminished (m+) and reactivity was removed after 2 HPC adsorptions. The patient specimen spiked with anti-Jk a showed the expected reactivity. Conclusion: Adsorptions with HPC were more efficient to remove reactivity at AHG than previously reported with RBCs. Reduced reactivity was noted and fewer adsorptions required when blood was drawn further from drug dosing. Use of HPC adsorptions and knowledge of drug-dose timing may offer improved efficiency of testing at AHG phase. Blood type and phenotype prior to initial drug dose, as well as phenotypically-matched blood remain critical as we optimize testing of patients on Hu5F9-G4.",

Klein 3 , Zohreh Tatari Calderone 2 and Ena Wang 2 . 1 CC-DTM, NIH, 2 Sidra Medicine, 3 NIH Background/Case Studies: One manifestation of worldwide genetic variation is a diverse ethnic distribution of blood group antigens, leading to unique challenges in transfusion support for each population. Although the 1000 Genomes project yielded important insights about the global red blood cell (RBC) antigen distribution, the Middle East population remains underrepresented in current worldwide large-scale sequencing databases. The genetic structure of the Qatari population, which has been profoundly impacted by the ancestral population (with a high level of consanguinity) and migratory flow, presents a fantastic example of genetic diversity of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Here we describe for the first time the predicted extended RBC and platelet phenotype from whole genome next generation sequencing (WGS) in 1,000 Qatari individuals. Study Design/Method: Paired-end WGS was performed on 1,000 Qatari nationals participating in the larger \"Qatar-Genome-Project\" study. Aligned data was analyzed using RyLAN (Red Cell and Leukocyte Antigen prediction from NGS) to query 398 known single nucleotide and indel variants in 36 red blood cell (RBC) and platelet antigen genes. Results/Finding: The highest variant nucleotide frequency was observed for the Fy a /Fy b and Do a /Do b loci (69% and 43%, respectively), followed by the ACKR1 promoter silencing variant (35%). Fifteen participants were carrying Hbb s , 82 were predicted as K1+k + and 4 as K1+k-. Kp a and Js a antigens were also present (0.05% and 0.9%). Among others, our analysis also revealed: one LU:-8,14, 10 Yt(ab + ), 4 Co(a + b + ) and 9 Jr(a -); 4 instances of Lu6/Lu9 heterozygosity; and 3 null Kidd alleles. A total of 281 participants carried 4 different weak Kidd antigen variants, including 12 in homozygous state. Select regions of the BCAM, FUT7, CR1 and KLF1 genes failed quality filters in less than 1% of the samples. For platelet-specific antigens, the frequency of HPA-3b allele (34%) was comparable to European countries, while the relatively-high frequency of the HPA-5b variant (19%) was comparable to Africa's. HPA-4b was not identified. The only detected platelet bw antigen was HPA-17bw. Conclusion: WGS data analysis reveals a unique combination of blood group and platelet antigens in the Qatari population, distinct from the continental blood group distributions extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project. The Qatari population possesses the highest frequency of the FY*02N.01 variant outside of Africa, suggestive of natural selection for resistance to malaria. Clinically, the high prevalence of alloimmunization observed in Qatar might be related to the high frequency of K1 polymorphism (4.5%) and weak Kidd antigens (28%), with the latter possibly leading to discordant serologic results. The Qatar population is composed of over 1.5M expatriate and about 300,000 Qatari nationals. Under such circumstances, RBC antigen discrepancy between donors and recipients with different genetic background can lead to alloimmunization against rare blood groups, frequently found in Qatar. Further study of genomic data by stratifying the Qatari population to its ancestry populations: Bedouin, Persian and Arab will help refine the knowledge of blood group diversity in the MENA region in general and in Qatar in particular, and will be an important step toward optimizing precision transfusion strategies in this region.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Genetic variation in ACKR1, also known as DARC, is associated with the FY blood group system. It is well appreciated that a promoter variant (c.-67) destroys a binding site for erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. Though it has been reported on the FY*01 allele, it is typically inherited on a FY*02 allele where it silences expression of Fy b . There are two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on exon 2 that are associated with weakened antigen expression. The FY c.265 and c.298 are typically found on FY*02 and weaken Fyb in what is termed FYX. The GATA variant is common in individuals of African descent and the FYX variants are most often found in individuals of Caucasian descent. Though they have been found on both the FY*01 and FY*02 alleles, they have not been found in cis. Here we report a blood donor with the GATA and FYX variants inherited in cis. Study Design/Method: Peripheral blood from a 37-year old African American male blood donor was tested for a panel of blood group antigen variants using PreciseType HEA Molecular BeadChip (Immucor) as part of routine testing. The panel found the donor was homozygous for c.-67C and c.125A and heterozygous for c.265C/T. The BASIS4G software resulted the donor as a possible variant (PV) for Fy a and Fy b . The donor had a history of serologically typing Fy(a-b-). Genomic DNA was reextracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Sanger sequencing of ACKR1 exons 1 and 2 were performed and the resulting sequence was aligned to consensus and variants compared to the Allele table of the ISBT Working Party for Red Cell Immunogenetics and Blood Group Terminology. Results/Finding: Sanger sequencing confirmed the genotypes at ACKR1 c.-67, c.125 and c.265 and identified heterozygosity for a synonymous SNP at c.36C/G. Conclusion: RBC genotyping panels use algorithms that integrate genotype results at multiple SNPs and population frequencies to predict an antigen phenotype. Since the SNP associated with FYX has not been coinherited with the promoter SNP that destroys the GATA binding site, the BASIS4G (Immucor) software resulted this donor phenotype as PV for Fy a and Fy b . Sanger sequencing confirmed that the donor carries one FY*02N.01 allele along with a novel allele encoding FYX but is silenced by the GATA variant. This case illustrates how high-throughput screening of blood donors followed by serologic confirmation can uncover new blood group alleles of serologic importance.",

Additionally, those patients who test as Rh positive but are actually a Partial D phenotype are not recognized as possibly being at risk for D allo-immunization and needing RhIG prophylaxis. At Elmhurst Memorial Hospital Blood Bank, all discrepant D typing samples were further evaluated by molecular testing. This has helped the Blood Bank identify patients who, despite typing as Rh positive were eligible for RhIG immunoprophylaxis. Study Design/Method: Over a period of fourteen months, from January 2017 to April, 2018, seven prenatal patient samples with reaction strength discrepancy between the automated gel methodology and manual tube method for D antigen were additionally subjected to RHD genotyping and screened for Weak/Partial D. Automated gel methodology (Erytra analyzer; Grifols Diagnostics) was used for primary typing.

Further information was obtained by a 2M urea lysis test and comparing serological phenotyping with molecular genotyping results. Results/Finding: A sample of plasma and red cells was received from a 56 year old female diagnosed with ovarian cancer and no reported transfusion history.

Blood utilization was optimized by not wasting rare Jk3 negative blood products. Conclusion: Through NGS analyses on 18 samples, we unexpectedly found two SNVs present in cis that were previously defined as distinct JK*01W alleles. These variants are similarly common in individuals of African ancestry. This NGS approach provided additional genomic information that confirmed phasing of SNVs. We propose determination of phase should be performed when possible to more accurately annotate alleles. , amount of platelet transfusion, G/C polymorphism of the IL-6 gene at position -572 and platelet antibody production were analyzed. Results/Finding: Age, sex, percentage patients with benign diseases, and percentage of patients with homozygotes for the C allele at position -572 of the IL-6 gene were similar between responders and non-responders; and they were also similar between patients with hematologic diseases and patients with non-hematologic diseases. Percentage of patients with hematologic diseases in responders was lower than that in non-responders (36.7% vs. 75%, P = 0.01).

Conclusion: In our study, we found that there was no association between IL-6 C-572G gene polymorphism and platelet antibody production. Patients with hematologic diseases had lower risk of platelet antibody production than patients with non-hematologic diseases.",

The Duffy protein acts as a receptor for distinct pro-inflammatory cytokines and malaria parasites P. vivax and P. knowlesi. We aimed to identify long range alleles of the ACKR1 gene, possibly including regulatory elements, without ambiguity in an autochthonous population in a malaria endemic area. Study Design/Method: We collected blood samples from 60 healthy volunteers in Ethiopia's southwestern low altitude tropical region. An assay was devised to amplify the ACKR1 gene as a single amplicon and determine its genomic sequence. All haplotypes were resolved at 5,178 nucleotides each, covering the coding sequence (CDS) of the ACKR1 gene including the 5' and 3' untranslated region (UTR), intron 1 and the 5' and 3' flanking region. For computational phasing, genotype data from the 60 Ethiopian individuals and the 2,504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project was used as input in the Markov chain-based haplotyper, MaCH. Results/Finding: In the 60 Ethiopians analyzed, 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 20 distinct genotype patterns were observed. Except for the GATA box mutation, no other SNP encoding a non-sense mutation was found. Physical evidence by allele-specific amplification, sequencing and fragment analysis allowed us to discern 18 ACKR1 alleles in the 120 chromosomes analyzed. All 18 alleles detected carried the SNP found in the common Fy(b+) phenotype. The clinically relevant FY*02N.01 allele in Africans was consistent with 16 of the 18 alleles. The other 2 alleles represented a FY*02 allele of the Fy(b+) and a FY*02W.01 allele of the Fy(b+ w ) phenotypes, respectively. Only 4 non-synonymous SNPs were found, and computational modeling indicated, that all 4 changes were neutral. Out of the 18 physically confirmed ACKR1 alleles, only 13 alleles were correctly predicted by the MaCH software while 5 alleles were missed. Another 4 haplotypes (23.5%), which did actually not occur among our Ethiopian cohort, were predicted by MaCH as single occurrences. In the 1000GP dataset with only 13 SNPs listed for the ACKR1 gene, MaCH predicted 20 haplotypes out of which only 2 were present in the Ethiopian cohort. Conclusion: We described 18 distinct ACKR1 alleles in an autochthonous East-African population. The high frequency of FY*02N.01 allele (95%) in this study is similar to other studies conducted in African regions (95% -100%). As an adjunct to the human reference genome assembly, which is the gold standard reference, our comprehensive population specific data and alleles are useful as template sequences for allele calling in highthroughput next-generation sequencing and precision medicine approaches.",

Background/Case Studies: SLC14A1 encodes a multipass transmembrane protein that expresses the Kidd blood group antigens. There is significant genetic variation in SLC14A1, also known as JK, including multiple variant JK*01 and JK*02 alleles that result in weak or null Jk a and Jk b antigen expression, respectively. We report here a JK*01 allele that includes a SNP in exon 8 that appears to silence expression of Jk a . Study Design/Method: Peripheral blood from a 31-year old African American female blood donor was tested for a panel of blood group antigen variants using Agena HemoID DQS (Agena Bioscience) as part of routine testing. The panel found the donor was heterozygous for c.838G/A and thus predicted the donor to type Jk(a+b+). The donor has a history of serologically typing Jk(a-b+). Genomic DNA was reextracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and total RNA was extracted from RBCs. Sequence-specific primer (SSP)-PCR for c.130G>A was performed. SLC14A1 exons 4, 6 and 8 were sequenced based on known null mutations in those gene regions. SLC14A1 exon and cDNA PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequence analysis and the resulting sequences were aligned to the consensus sequence. Variants were compared to the Allele Background/Case Studies: The RH locus is composed of two highly homologous genes, RHD and RHCE, each of which are composed of 10 exons. They are distributed in an opposite orientation, which facilitates macro or micro gene conversions that can lead to the absence of high frequency antigens, create hybrid proteins encoding low frequency antigens, and create partial antigens. Currently, the Rh blood group system comprises 55 antigens. Gene conversions encode variant proteins, some of which are the so-called partial D phenotypes. Numerous partial D phenotypes, which are usually identified when a D positive person makes an alloanti-D, have been described. Partial D are more common in people of African descent. We report here the case of a Caucasian pregnant woman harboring the RHD*DIIIb variant allele with a complex antibody mixture. Study Design/Method: Standard hemagglutination techniques (including allogeneic and autologous adsorptions) and RHD/RHCE genomic DNA sequencing of the 10 exons with \"in house\" techniques were performed. Antibody titration was done in LISS-IAT-IgG column-agglutination technique. RhD typing was performed with the DiaClon ABO/Rh (Biorad\u2122), using the IH1000 instrument.",

No RhD weakening was noticed (reaction 4+). The antibody screen showed a complex mixture of alloantibodies: anti-D, anti-C, anti-e, anti-S, and anti-K. Their titers were 64, 128, 128, 32, and 4 respectively. An autoantibody against a high frequency antigen on papain-treated RBCs was also identified. Molecular work was undertaken to confirm the suspicion of a partial D. Genomic testing found this patient to harbor a variant allele RHD*DIIIb (RHD*03.02) in the homozygous or more likely hemizygous state. The sequencing of the RHCE gene showed no alteration and confirmed this patient to be RHCE*cE in the homozygous state. She was typed as G (RH12) negative. Then anti-G was individualized from anti-D and anti-C. Group O, r\"r\", K-, S-units were cross-matched and found to be compatible. An urgent call was made to collect fresh units. The newborn was typed as group AB, D+C+E+C+e+, K+. At birth his DAT was 3+. Elution showed a panagglutination, which was not investigated due to the small amount of the sample received. His level of hemoglobin was 17.4 g/dL, and the total bilirubin was 45 \u03bcmol/L. At day 2 the hemoglobin dropped to 14.4 g/dL and bilirubin was 124 \u03bcmol/L. He was treated with phototherapy. At day 5, he was discharged from the hospital. The outpatient follow up was stopped after 2 months when the baby's hemoglobin was 10.4 g/dL.

Study Design/Method: Over a period of 9 weeks segments were removed from 785 D + red blood cell (RBC) units previously found to be negative for the C and E antigens. Initially, all Ro donors were tested without considering ethnicity; later it was decided to check each donor's record to identify those who self-reported as having African American (AA) ethnicity. Each group O + donor was tested by a gel technique using unlicensed antisera shown to be reactive with 3 different reagent cells positive for Go a and nonreactive with cells positive for the Js a , He, V, VS, RH32 and STEM antigens. Group A + and B + donors were tested by a gel technique with an eluate prepared from cells used to adsorb plasma containing anti-Go a . This eluate was also shown to be reactive with 3 cells positive for Go a and nonreactive with the same cells as the antisera as well as cells positive for A1 and B antigens. Go a positive donors were confirmed to have a negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT) in gel. Results/Finding: Please refer to the following table.",

While 2-3% of Caucasians are expected to have the Ro phenotype, 17.3% of the Ro donors we tested were Caucasian. This likely reflects the predominance of Caucasian blood donors and the continued underrepresentation of minorities in our donor base.

Study Design/Method: Samples with discrepancy between red cells and serum grouping were categorized as specific subgroups by standard serological methods. Unexpected anti-A1 or anti-B in propositas\u00a1\u00afserum was identified using A1 or B red cells. Platelet activation status was measured as microparticle (MP) content (ThromboLUX, LightIntegra Technology Inc., Canada). The optimal threshold to predict PLT activation in single donor platelets (SDP) suspended in plasma was previously determined as 15% (specificity = 89% and sensitivity = 55%). The clinical response to activated and non-activated SDP was compared for all HLA-positive and HLA-negative study patients. Results/Finding: Twenty one of 200 patients (10.5%) tested positive for anti-HLA antibodies (HLA-positive), 8 became refractory with insufficient 1hr and 24-hr CCIs following two consecutive random PLT transfusions and 5 patients showed only insufficient 24-hr CCIs.

Only one patient, a 65 yr old male with AML, received HLA-matched PLTs that were characterized for PLT activation status.

Two other modifications c.209G>A (Arg70Gln) and c.998G>A (Ser333Asn) were found respectively in RHD exon 2 and exon 7. The presence of these mutations were characteristic of the presence of RHD*DAU2, with a predicted partial weak D phenotype. Conclusion: The 70Gln and 333Asn amino acid changes are located in the inner boundary of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane. These changes affect D antigen integration and proper expression, with drastic decrease of D antigen density. Such individuals react differently when tested with various anti-D monoclonal antibodies. The accessibility to a referral laboratory for genomic testing is important for timely identification of these variants. Background/Case Studies: Demand for red blood cell (RBC) antigen negative products continues to rise. This has been triggered by studies suggesting that RBC more closely matched to the patient may decrease the likelihood of alloimmunization. This creates the need for blood centers to employ high-volume screening methods. In addition, the demand for highincidence antigen negative RBCs must match the need. There are several methods that can be applied such as standard tube, automated serology, microplate (MCP), and molecular HEA BeadChip (HBC). HBC strength is its ability to test many antigens simultaneously. Its shortcomings include cost and its limitation to detect many null phenotypes, especially in RH, K, and JK systems (detectable by serology). Our immunohematology reference lab relies on screening by serology and MCP was initially chosen for its highvolume capability with the focus on screening common antigens: CEce, K, Fy a Fy b ; Jk a Jk b ; Ss. The algorithm was expanded to include directed testing based on ethnicity and broad testing for high-and or low-incidence antigens based on antisera availability. Newly encountered high-incidence antigen negative donors were sent for testing with HBC. Study Design/Method: RBC units were sorted based on three ethnicities: African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian. Units were tested for CEce, K, and Kp b to detect any K 0 donors. Units that were negative for two of four Rh and K antigens were further tested for Fy a Fy b ; Jk a Jk b ; Ss. Units that were K+, regardless of RhCE types were tested for k by MCP. Units that did not meet the above criteria were not tested further. For the African American and Hispanic ethnicities Js a and Di a were also tested. Units that typed Js (a+) or Di (a +) were tested for Js b or Di b respectively. Those found to be Js (b-) or Di (b-) had HBC requested. In addition units that typed S-s-were submitted for HBC. In total 222,212 antigens were tested by MCP screening method. Several units negative for high-incidence antigen (k, Js b , and U) were discovered. We did not find any units with null phenotpyes from the RH, K, or JK systems. Conclusion: The use of combined serology (MCP) and molecular HBC algorithm allowed us to nimbly adapt to specific needs based on changing patient population. The MCP method was instrumental to support of the ever-increasing antigen negative unit requirements. While low resolution molecular screening methods have their strength and are increasingly commonplace, serologic screening permitted for detection of rare donors that could be missed by molecular methods and provided for inexpensive screening of a large number of donor units. Numbers like these proved that MCP is a true stalwart method.",

Antibody binding of sensitized RBCs is determined by the performance of an Indirect Antiglobulin Test. It might be expected that a strong antibody would more likely to result in a positive MMA and a weakly reactive antibody would be more likely to result in a negative MMA. Study Design/Method: The MMA is performed by using antigen positive and antigen negative red blood cells in cases of a known antibody specificity. The selected RBCs are incubated with the patient's serum, with and without a source of fresh complement present. Each red blood cell tested is also incubated with saline (saline controls) to control for any increased reactivity that might be present with the RBCs alone. The RBC sensitization is performed by incubating tubes in a water bath at 37C for one hour, with intermittent mixing. Antiglobulin tests are performed on all red cell samples using anti-IgG and anti-C3, including the saline controls. This study is focused on comparing the reactivity of the antibody coated RBCs and the Background/Case Studies: SLC14A1 gene on chromosome 18 encodes for the KIDD(JK) glycoprotein which carries the blood group system antigens: Jk a (Jk1), Jk b (Jk2) and Jk3. The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane transporter that mediates urea transport in erythrocytes. The JK glycoprotein consists of 10 intramembrane domains and 5 extracellular loops. Jk a and Jk b antigens expression results from a single nucleotide polymorphism 838G>A in exon 9, Asn280Asp. The antigens are located on the 4 th extracellular loop. Several mutations identified in exon 7 and intron 9 are responsible for weakened expression of the JK antigens. We are reporting a novel silencing mutation discovered due to discordance between the serological and predicted molecular Jk a phenotype of a red cell donor who self-identified as White, not Hispanic. Study Design/Method: Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA whole blood samples using automated magnetic particle nucleic acid purification method. The DNA was tested by multiplex PreciseType\u2122 HEA Molecular BeadChip Test (Immucor, BioArray Solutions, NJ, USA). Both nucleotides associated with JKA and JKB polymorphisms were present, which predicted the Jk(a+b+) phenotype. Historical serological phenotypes on two separate donations showed the phenotype as Jk(a-b+). A third serological typing on a new sample using monoclonal Anti-Jk a (Bio-Rad) confirmed the previous Jk(a-b+) phenotype. Subsequently, a bi-directional sequencing study was performed with Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA analyzer using BigDye\u00ae Terminator v.3.1 sequencing kit (Life Technologies Co., CA, USA) and DNA was analyzed using Geneious Pro 5.1.7 (Biomatters, Auckland, NZ) bioinformatics software platform. The obtained nucleotide base sequence was compared against NCBI Reference Sequence NG_011775.3. Results/Finding: The sequencing analysis revealed a 15-nucleotide deletion at c.522_536del (p.VAL_Pro179del) in exon 7 that does not impact the downstream nucleotide sequence. Mutations in JK exon 7 at the 511 or 548 nb locations have been implicated with the presence of an aberrant weak Jk a antigen which may or may not be detected by serological methods.

Extensive RBC antigen matching including the Rh and Kell systems should be considered in politransfused patients regardless their basal disease, in order to avoid alloimmunization and hemolytic transfusion reactions. Background/Case Studies: Children with transfusion dependent anemia, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia, are at an increased risk for developing red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies due to their lifelong need for transfusion therapy.

Study Design/Method: Key members of the transfusion service (TS), immunohematology reference laboratory (IRL), and hematology clinic (HC) caring for children with sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and other hemoglobinopathies met to develop a chronic transfusion therapy program to benefit these patients to help minimize the risk of red cell alloimmunization. The children enrolled had baseline genotyping performed, including 37 RBC antigens, as well as detection of the FY*B_GATA mutation and other possible significant mutations in the Rh system. Forms were developed to assist with communication between the HC, TS, and IRL. Transfusion intervals and volumes for each patient were estimated to obtain the freshest (less than 2 weeks) blood available and matched in the Rh and Kell systems for those with negative antibody screens. Double RBC units were collected when possible for patients requiring more than 1 unit in a single transfusion episode. Patients who developed RBC alloantibodies were switched to phenotypically matched RBCs to prevent the development of additional antibodies based on their profile. Results/Finding: Since the inception of the program in June 2016, 29 patients with the following disorders were enrolled: 10 with SCD, 17 with thalassemia, and 2 with other disorders. At enrollment, 6 (21%) had RBC alloantibodies, including 2 SCD patients with anti-e, who previously received C-E-K-phenotypically matched blood, but were found to have variant e antigen by genotyping. Of those children without alloantibodies at enrollment, 1 (4%) developed antibody (anti-S) following the provision of RBCs matched for the Rh and Kell systems. Of those with antibodies who received extended-match units, none developed additional alloantibodies. Conclusion: Genotyping was successfully incorporated into this CTTP to provide more precisely matched blood, reducing the risk of RBC alloantibody development. Much more information is provided with a genotype compared to traditional serologic phenotyping and without the expense of cell separation techniques in recently transfused patients. Prevention of RBC antigen sensitization helps to avoid costly serologic work-ups, prevent delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and improves blood management. An additional benefit includes improved availability of blood for patients with otherwise rare blood types, particularly when the GATA mutation is present. Background/Case Studies: The gold standard for compatibility testing has historically been based upon serologic testing by tube, gel and solid phase methodologies to detect red cell agglutination. There are several conditions, however, when serology cannot be relied upon for determining the safest blood for transfusion. Molecular testing for human blood group antigens has provided a reliable method to accurately predict the phenotype of a transfusion recipient without extensive serologic testing. In addition to adding insight to variant blood group antigens, this has created a new arena for matching blood donors for patient transfusion. This abstract describes how molecular testing has been incorporated into the blood collection facility, and how this has influenced changes in our Immunohematology Laboratory Practices. Study Design/Method: Sixty donors with a record of multiple donations but without a full phenotype or molecular genotype are selected each week for testing by an outside contracted laboratory. The molecular results are electronically transferred to the Blood Establishment Computer System (BECS). Staff in the immunohematology reference laboratory (IRL) validate the results transmitted. Rare units with unique antigens are then added to the frozen blood inventory and reported to the American Rare Donor Program (ARDP). Results/Finding: By the end of 3 years, our fully phenotyped donor database has expanded to include 9000 fully tested donors. In addition, we have identified 123 rare donors that we are recruiting to add to our rare frozen units and to report to the ARDP. (See Table 1 ) Discussion: In addition to donors, we have performed molecular testing on patients to improve medical care. The majority of the patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) in our area have had molecular genotyping performed. This enables the IRL to provide phenotypically similar RBC units in efforts to prevent alloimmunization. The IRL also selects patients for molecular genotyping who have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, drug interferences (i.e. daratumumab), and multiple transfusions to phenotype match, not only to prevent alloimmunization, but to simplify the process of providing the best matched blood available for those patients. The IRL has also provided blood collected from rare donors identified by molecular genotyping to other blood centers that have a patient with a need for rare blood. Conclusion: It is unlikely that genotyping will fully replace serologic testing, but it is proving to be a complementary adjunct for our immunohematology service. Hemovigilence is the focus of many associations that manage the care of patients who are being transfused. Molecular genotyping aids in providing blood for SCD patients, for those with significant autoimmune disease, and for other medical conditions. Molecular genotyping has enormous potential to revolutionize practice in blood centers to establish large donor pools of fully typed donors as well as identify many donors with rare blood groups. Background/Case Studies: The incidence of HDFN caused by Rh'D' antigen has reduced to markedly low levels in developed countries but it still poses a challenge to the health care system in the developing countries. At Present, the Conventional Test Tube (CTT) method is recommended for performing the titration of antibodies in antenatal cases but CTT is increasingly being replaced by Gel Microcolumn Agglutination (GMA) systems as it offers many advantages to the transfusion laboratory. There have been few studies on this topic but no clear guidelines have been established about the precise method of titration in antenatal cases by GMA. Study Design/Method: Samples from 510 Rh negative antenatal females were evaluated over a period of 2 years.These were initially subjected to Indirect Agglutination Test(IAT) by CTT (using polyspecific AHG) well as GMA (3 Cell Antibody Screening Panel). Positive samples were subjected to identification of antibodies by using 11 cell antibody identification panel.",

Out of these, 20 cases also tested positive by tube method. 36 tested positive only by GMA( 33 had history of Anti-D).The antibody identified was Anti-D in 54 cases and a combination of Anti-C+Anti-D in 2 cases. Titration by tube method using LISS gave very few positive results and titration by GMA using Normal Saline(NS) resulted in mixed field reactions, so these two methods were not included for further analysis. Only the titers obtained by CTT using NS and GMA using LISS were included for further analysis. Titration was performed on a total of 61 different samples obtained from 20 antenatal cases and the values were further evaluated for Karl Pearson Coefficient of correlation. It was evaluated to be 0.756 with pvalue = .001 when all these samples were included, which suggested moderate correlation but for cases involving single antibody(Anti-D), it was evaluated to be 0.893 with p value=.001, which suggested a strong correlation. 12 out of the 20 cases had undergone IUT and 4 cases were reported to have IUFD. The titer values for these patients were noted to be at least 16 by CTT and 512 by GMA. Conclusion: GMA is a highly sensitive and precise method for titration in antenatal cases and the prospect of reporting titer by GMA along with CTT should be evaluated so that the treating clinician can be made aware about the results of these two methods. CTT and GMA had a better correlation when a single antibody was present. year old man with extensive cardiac past medical history presented with acute appendicitis. He refused surgery and was treated with antibiotics (3 days of piperacillin/tazobactam followed by ten days of ampicillin/clavulanic acid). He returned to the ER 3 days after discharge with a ruptured appendix and underwent urgent surgery. He was treated empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam on admission. After 48 hours, his Hb fell from 10.7 g/dL to 4 g/dl, accompanied by markers for acute hemolysis (LDH: 1379 U/L; haptoglobin: < 10 g/dl; indirect bilirubin: 5 mg/dl). His indirect coombs test revealed a panagglutinin. His DAT was positive for IgG but not C3. The eluate was negative. There was strong suspicion for DIIHA and the piperacillin/tazobactam was held. A sample of his blood was sent to New York Blood Center which revealed antibody to piperacillin detected by the \"immune complex\" method. In addition, anti-e-like specificity was observed that was very weakly reactive by PEG IAT and IgG gel test with papain-treated panel RBC's. Interestingly, patient was positive for e antigen by phenotype. The patient developed acute renal failure and oliguria requiring dialysis. He subsequently went into acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Repeat DAT was negative 7 days after initial DAT checked. His clinical condition improved over 10 days. His hematocrit improved back to his baseline, however the patient was dialysis dependent for 3 months prior to improvement in renal function. Conclusion: Unlike other penicillins and cephalosporins, piperacillin induced hemolytic anemia is typically complement mediated and induces a brisk and severe hemolysis. DAT tests are usually positive due to RBCbound complement and IgG. This case demonstrates that piperacillin can induce a brisk and severe hemolytic anemia in the absence of detectable complement. Rapid withdrawal of piperacillin is essential for recovery, but end organ damage may have a delayed recovery. investigations were conducted upon detection of antigen typing discrepancies between current and previous donations. Process improvements were implemented over time and the impact on the frequency of typing discrepancies was evaluated. Study Design/Method: The Blood Establishment Computer System (BECS) provides correlation between current testing results and previous results. A retrospective review of donor antigen typing discrepancies flagged by BECS was completed. Discrepancies flagged in house prior to labeling were classified as internal discrepancies; antigen typing repeated by the hospital customer and reported to be discrepant were classified as external discrepancies. Each discrepancy was investigated to determine the cause. Identified discrepancies post-implementation of process changes were evaluated. Results/Finding: During a 9-year period, 396 discrepancies were detected. More than 80% of these involved genetic Rh variation or FYX associated with weak blood group antigen typing not detected by some commercial FDA licensed reagents. Investigations revealed process failures in multiple departments can also contribute to donor antigen typing discrepancies, including: collections, data entry, technical procedures, and information systems. Key process improvements include the implementation of a selfadministered donor health history with 7 electronically-captured identification points and development of a job aid for the investigation of duplicate donors. Testing procedure revisions included process for obtaining segments from units for testing, incubation for the maximum time recommended by manufacturer, and requirement of confirmation by a second manufacturer's reagent for e negative antigen typing. Genotyping performed on samples with typing discrepancies was key to identify genetic variation in levels of antigen expression. As a result of process changes, non-ABO/D antigen typing discrepancies decreased from approximately 1 in 5,300 collections to 1 in 10,000 collections over a 9 year period. Conclusion: Donor typing discrepancies frequencies were reduced through the implementation of process improvements across multiple departments and systems. An information system with the functionality to compare current and previous testing is a critical feature for labeling with historical non-ABO/D antigens. Genetic variants are a frequent cause of testing discrepancies and warrant investigation. Investigating all discrepancies, recognizing sources of error, and responding with process improvements are crucial to implement a robust system for labeling with historical non-ABO/D blood group antigens. Background/Case Studies: Antigens in Pr series are associated with sialic acid residues on glycophorins that are protease/sialidase-sentive. Anti-Pr M was also reported to have specificity to determinants reside in side chains attached to MN sialoglycoproteins. Majority of the Pr specific antibodies are generally cold agglutinins that react optimally at lower temperature but can rarely be IgG, IgA or have biphasic property. Cases of autoanti-Pr that can cause severe hemolytic anemia has been reported. In this case, we report a patient with gammaglobulinemia and a high titer/thermal amplitude anti-Pr M who did not show obvious evidence of hemolysis.",

The antibody titers were as follows: Conclusion: In keeping with the rarity of JK variants, the yield of clinically significant variants in our series of highly selected cases was relatively low (4 of 13, 30%). All 4 patients were Jk(a+b+). In patients who have antibodies associated with suspected variant JK, the Jk phenotype can guide the selection of units for RBC transfusion. For a patient with heterozygous phenotype, antigen-negative units matched for the antibody may be given, as there is no concern for alloimmunization against the antithetical Jk antigen. For a patient with homozygous phenotype [Jk(a+b-) or Jk(a-b+)], antigen-negative transfusions should be deferred because of the likely presence of at least one conventional allele, and the risk of exposure to the antithetical foreign antigen. We conclude that the real value of molecular testing lies in identifying patients without clinically significant variants, as unnecessary restrictions on RBC unit selection can be lifted, especially in patients with multiple alloantibodies. and tube agglutination methods using commercial monoclonal (BioRad, Germany) and polyclonal reagents.

Although DNA genotyping for the prediction of blood groups has great value, the genotype is not always consistent with the phenotype. Many genetic events may cause apparent discrepant results between hemagglutination and DNA genotyping. Sequencing remains the \"gold standard\" for the study of complex RH molecular variants. One case of abnormal type B blood group was identified through using the microcolumn gel card and test tube methods to determine blood group respectively, and detecting blood group substance in saliva, using the anticoagulant whole blood to extract DNA (QIAamp Blood Kit) and sequence (Invitrogen Corporation). Two generations of pedigrees were investigated, and activity of glycosyltransferase in erythrocyte membranes and serum was measured in blood donor samples. Blood samples were transformed in vitro using UDP-galactose and the serum of normal type B. Results/Finding: Bm subtype was confirmed by blood group serology test, genotyping and sequencing results. The new mutational sites were 43G/T and 45C/G mutations in exon 1. Family survey results showed that both father and sister were normal type O blood group, while the mother was type Bm-mutant, which similarly weakly expressing B antigen and including 43G/T and 45C/G mutations in exon 1(GAC>TAG), suggesting that the mutation was heritable. This mutation led to premature termination of protein coding in exon 1 and a significant decrease of activity of glycosyltransferase in the serum. Treatment with UDP-galactose could convert the Bm subtype blood group into the normal type B blood group in vitro. Conclusion: Bm subtype blood group resulted by a new heritable mutation site (exon1, 43G/T and 45C/G) is found during the blood group examination. UDP-galactose combined with normal type B serum has a corrective effect on the Bm subtype blood group, suggesting that abnormal blood group can be corrected by changing the activity of glycosyltransferase to improve the safety of blood transfusion.",

Through this case, the authors want to emphasize that the protocol of IAT testing for blood donors, irrespective of the Rh status, should be incorporated in all the blood banks as it will improve the safety of blood transfusion services for patients.

This number of allo-immunizations is related to the number of births in this same region to determine the prevalence of alloimmunization during pregnancy. We also evaluate the impact of the recommendation of the National College of Obstetricians implemented since 2005, about the systematic injection of RhIg at the 28 week of amennorhea, by studying the incidence of anti-D alloimmunization in this cohort. Results/Finding: For these 10 years we analysed 6688 pregnancies with allo-immunization (ie 1.05% of pregnant women). 19.5% had antibodies that can be implicated in hemolytic disease of the fetus (anti-D, anti-c, anti-Kell). 54.1% had antibodies that can be implicated in hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-C, anti-E, anti-e, anti-Fya ..) and 39.1% had antibodies with no incidence during pregnancy (anti-Le, anti-P1..).",

These results are comparable to those of other countries that also practice routine injection at the beginning of the 3rd quarter. Conclusion: All these results over a broad period of 10 years show differences in the prevalence of antibodies in pregnant women compared to other countries. Indeed, in France, the respect of the RHK phenotype for any transfusion in a young woman decreases the number of allo-immunized women in these systems.

Up to 42% (1374/3263) were considered uneventful regarding blood unit selection: 417 cases lack antibody, 519 cases were considered as having non-specific reactions (cold agglutinin, antibodies to RBC media, non-specific antibody without clinically significant underlying antibodies, antibody against Daratumumab) and 438 cases showed antibodies against blood group antigen specificity without clinical significance such as RhIg and Knops. Data regarding the two types of unexpected RBCs antibodies (alloantibodies and autoantibodies) was calculated from a sample so that inferences could be make to the evaluated cases. In addition, solely antibody with Rh specificity against D and e specificity were evaluated and were classified in the uneventful category whenever they were autoantibodies or considered clinically significant if they were alloantibodies. In total, 1889 cases showed blood group antigen specificity with clinical significance. Among the 1889 cases, 762 showed a unique antibody of which 381 were against an Rh specificity (50%), 2 antibodies were found in 621 cases (541 cases with at least one anti-Rh; 87.1%) and 506 cases had more than 2 antibodies (491 cases with at least one anti-Rh; 97%).

It clearly showed that anti-Rh remain the major burdens in patient management. Rare cases were also unrevealed through this work. For example, 5 cases of anti-U, 3 cases of anti-PEL and 1 anti-Ge3 were identified. It was intended to produce a comprehensive portrait of the investigated cases, the whole picture being lost through the workload and the urgency behind some requests. It also serves to demonstrate the relevance of antibody work ups in order to prevent transfusion reaction and favor patient outcome. Background/Case Studies: The introduction of immunoprophylaxis for RhD negative pregnant women has drastically reduced the incidence of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. However, immunoglobin administration is not risk free, and has high costs. The discovery of circulant free fetal DNA (cffDNA) prompted the introduction of non-invasive fetal RHD genotyping in maternal plasma. This approach is increasingly being adopted in several countries, since it avoids treatment in the substantial proportion of RhD negative woman who will give birth to a RhD negative child (about 40%). The purpose of this study was to validate a method for the antenatal, non-invasive determination of fetal RHD status using cffDNA from maternal plasma. We present preliminary data about our ongoing validation. Study Design/Method: We consequently analyzed the samples from 33 RhD negative pregnant women between 19 and 29 weeks of gestation, with an unknown or positive RhD partner. The genomic DNA was extracted from maternal plasma, separated by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, US) or using automatic extraction with QIASymphony. In order to determine the fetal RHD genotype, we used Taqman primers and probes to detect exons 5, 7, and 10 of RHD gene by Real-Time PCR (Free DNA Fetal Kit RhD, Institut de Biotechnologies Jacques Boy, Bio-Rad, Foster City, CA). As internal controls, we added Maize DNA (Bio-Rad) before extraction and used primers/probes sets specific to Maize DNA. The results of antenatal fetal genotyping were compared to those obtained on postnatal cord blood Rh phenotyping.",

Conclusion: Fetal RHD genotyping from maternal plasma is a promising tool for the management of RhD negative pregnant women. If these data will be confirmed on a larger series, the non invasive approach will reduce the risk for mothers and their babies and reduce unnecessary anti-RhDIg immunoprophylaxis.",

The establishment of known antigen platelet donor database could provide a fast and convenient way to find antigen-negative matched-platelet donors for the relative immune patients. HLA and HPA were the important antigens that cause platelet alloimmunization diseases, populations at different areas have their own polymorphic characters of HLA and HPA. Nanning is an important comprehensive transportation hub city located in southwestern China with more than 7 million people. The aim of this study was to design and establish the platelet donor database with known HLA, HPA genotype that could be suitable for the population in Nanning area of China, and to provide a guarantee for the treatment of the patients with immune PTR and immune thrombocytopenia as well. Study Design/Method: Total of 4243 unrelated and random healthy individuals were used to the population study of HPA -1 to-17w polymorphism in Nanning area of China. and 7001 individuals from the China Marrow Donor Program were used to the population study of HLA-A, -B polymorphism at Nanning area. Based on the data of population studied above, the optimal size of platelet donor database was predicted, and which was to be set as the goal to design and establish the Platelet Donor Database with Known HLA, HPA Genotype in Nanning Area (Named with Nanning Area Platelet Donor Database with Known HLA, HPA Genotype).

To remove 2ME from treated plasma prior to antibody testing, it is common to dialyze plasma overnight (Method A). Ultrafiltration devices used for drug analysis can also be used for 2ME removal and same day testing (Method B). This study evaluates the two methods for statistical differences. Study Design/Method: Eleven blood samples with alloantibodies were selected for 2 methods of 2ME removal. Method A used 12kDA NMWL cellulose dialysis tubing and Method B used 30 kDA NMWL ultrafiltration devices (Centrifree Ultrafiltration Device with Ultracel YM-T, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) for 2ME removal. Specimens from both methods were titrated and tested for IgM and IgG ABO isohemaglutinin levels by manual tube testing. Confirmation of a previously identified alloantibody after treatment was also performed to ensure clinically significant antibodies were still detectable. Method A, 2mL treated plasma was dialyzed overnight in 1L phosphate buffered saline and then recovered from the tubing. Method B, 2ml treated plasma was added to 2 device sample chambers then spun in a fixed angle centrifuge for 30 minutes at 1,000g. In the ultrafiltration device, free plasma solutes were filtered across a cellulose membrane and filtered plasma was recovered from the sample chamber above the filter. Doubling dilutions were performed for each analyte and tested in parallel by tube method. Determination of IgM ABO isohemagglutinin levels was achieved after a 15-minute room temperature incubation, and IgG levels after a 15minute 37-degree C incubation, four times automated wash, and anti-human globulin. The endpoint for titration was determined by the last tube with a 1 + reaction. For statistical analysis, the titration concentrations were normalized to the last tube dilution with a 1 + reaction. The differences between dialyzed and filtered plasma endpoints were used in a paired t-test for determination of significant difference. Results/Finding: There was no significant difference between methods for IgM (p=0.51) or IgG (p=0.78) ABO isohemaglutinin titers. The hypothesized mean difference = 0 has not been rejected at p=0.05. Previously identified alloantibodies were still detectable after 2ME treatment. Conclusion: Plasma samples treated with 2ME did not show a statistical difference between dialyzed or filtered plasma. The use of ultrafiltration devices allows same day testing with acceptable 2ME removal while maintaining immunoglobulins. Background/Case Studies: High titer antibodies coating cognate antigen are a rare cause of false-negatives in red blood cell (RBC) antigen phenotyping; an event referred to as \"blocking phenomenon\" or \"blocked antigen phenomenon (BAP).\"In hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), BAP can complicate the laboratory work-up as fetal phenotype helps confirm the cause of hemolysis. Treating cord RBCs with ethylene glycine arginine (EGA) will remove BAP and maintain expression of most antigens, except K. Only 2 cases of HDFN with BAP by K antibody have been published, despite 10% of reported HDFN involving anti-K. In both cases, chloroquine diphosphate (CDP) was used to resolve BAP, but was effective in only one. In a published comparison of elution methods, CDP failed to remove RBC coating antibodies 6 times more frequently than heat elution. Further, given the efficacy and greater applicability of EGA, our laboratory no longer maintains an inventory of CDP. We report a case of severe HDFN with BAP due to anti-K where we used modified gentle heat elution to remove BAP. Case Report: A 36-year-old multiparous female presented at 33 weeks with a pregnancy complicated by high-titer K antibodies and ultrasound evidence of fetal anemia. A cesarean section was performed with emergent postdelivery neonatal exchange transfusion for severe HDFN. Test results on the pre-exchange neonatal blood specimens were typical of those found in HDFN. However, initial neonatal RBC phenotyping for K antigen was negative. Study Design/Method: Serologic tests were done using standard procedures. A modified gentle heat elution method with equal parts packed RBCs and 6% albumin heated at 45\u00b0C for 30 minutes was used to dissociate suspected blocking K antibodies from RBCs. Repeat K phenotyping was performed after 5-minute room temperature incubation. Confirmatory genotyping was performed by a reference laboratory using the BioArray platform (Immucor Inc., Norcross GA). Results/Finding: The modified gentle heat elution procedure resulted in successful removal of BAP by anti-K while preserving RBC K antigen for typing (Table 1) . Genotyping confirmed neonatal RBCs to be K antigen positive.",

Study Design/Method: The patient's clinical symptoms and laboratory findings including blood bank laboratory workup were studied. Results/Finding: The patient was a 44 years old male with past medical history of sickle cell anemia (Hemoglobin SC disease) complicated by bilateral hip avascular necrosis and acute chest syndrome requiring full red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion. He has history of multiple transfusions. Besides several historical anti-E, anti-Fy a antibodies, the patient was found to have an antibody to a high prevalence antigen in the Dombrock system, resembling anti-Holley antibody. However, samples submitted for red cell genotyping using microarray-based ID Core XT(Grifols) indicated that the patient had genotype of Holley antigen. Since anti-Holley antibodies may be induced by partial Holley antigen on RBC surface, NGS was performed to further characterize this particular antigen. No mutations were detected in the NGS study, which suggested that the antibody initially identified was less likely an anti-Holley antibody. The clinical significance of this unknown antibody was later assessed using a monocyte monolayer assay (MMA). The result indicated the antibody was clinically insignificant.

It is an important reason for the inefficacy of red blood cell transfusion that some irregular antibodies cannot be detected in the application of routine pretransfusion detection methods. The detection rate of irregular antibodies in the normal population was 0.3% $ 2%, and the positive rate was 38% when the method was sensitive. Study Design/Method: 1500 cases of blood transfusion were collected. There were 816 males and 684 females, aged 0-82 years. There were ABO and Rh(D) homologous blood transfusions, in accordance with blood transfusion indications, and cross matching with blood in all medical records. Compared with the value of the hemoglobin before blood transfusion, it didn't rise to the expected value, which was re-examined within 24 hours after infusion of red blood cell preparations, and eliminating blood loss, blood dilution and other reasons, and no clinical signs of hemolytic transfusion reaction, namely as the ineffective blood transfusion. Using enhanced detection methods to carry out irregular antibody identification for patients with the ineffective blood transfusion: Background/Case Studies: Blood group chimerism is a rare phenomenon occurring either congenital or acquired, and few cases are described by literature. Since these cases do not present major clinical manifestations and are usually recognized at the time of blood group typing by mixed-field agglutination or discrepancies of cell typing /serum typing, it requires further evaluation to differentiate between ABO subgroups, cis-AB and blood group chimerism. Study Design/Method: We describe a case of female twins with ABO and Rh antigens chimerism detected during routine donor ABO typing and resolved through serologic and molecular studies. Results/Finding: Red blood cells (RBCs) mixed-field reaction was detected in a 21-year-old female donor typing routine. Double populations in gel column with anti-A and anti-B antibodies, while serum typing did not identify antibodies. She was asked for a new blood collection, together with her relatives. Father, mother and twins had new blood, serum and salive samples collected. Father typed B positive and mother A positive and none discrepancies detected. The twins blood typing reproduced the same results initially detected, salive studies showed presence of A and B substances secretion. Cis-AB and ABO subgroups hypothesis were excluded.

After 3 months, the patient had paresthesia in the lower limbs and additional treatment with 6 doses of IVIG was indicated. After the first dose of the blood product, the patient presented severe intravascular hemolysis, with marked anemia and reticulocytosis. In total, she received three doses of IVIG, however, in the following two doses the patient had mild anemia. Immunohematological studies showed that the patient was C-E-K-and had an anti-C in her serum. After the second and third doses of IVIG an anti-C, anti-E and auto anti-e were identified by gel test in LISS and Enzyme. Before administering the fourth dose of the immunoglobulin serological tests in the immunoglobulin were performed and showed the presence of an anti-E and an auto-IgG. Background/Case Studies: The MASPAT is a solid-phase based assay for platelet cross-matching to find the compatible donor platelets for transfusion, where patient serum is tested against several donor platelets. It's a rapid and simple way for this purpose and has been widely used in hospitals as well as in some blood service institutions. Flow cytometry has been used for screening of platelet antibodies in patient serum for a long time.",

            "text": "Each of these two methods has respective advantages.We compare crossmatching results from flow cytometry assay and MASPAT to elucidate the pattern of difference between the two. Study Design/Method: 20 patients for compatible platelet transfusion are chosen randomly. Serum from each patient is tested against platelets from 6 ABO-compatible donors respectively (i.e., 120 patient-donor pairs in total) using flow cytometry assay, and the results are compared with those from MASPAT which is routinely used for cross-matching in Shanghai Blood Center. In flow cytometry assay, washed platelets are incubated with serum at room temperature and washed 3 times, following by incubation with FITC-labeled anti-human antibody. Platelets are washed again and subjected to flow cytometry, where samples with FITC median fluorescence intensity (MFI) in platelet gate greater than twice of that for negative control (healthy AB donor serum) are determined as positive. The MASPAT as well as the result elucidation is performed according to manufacturer's manual. Results/Finding: Among the 20 patient samples, only 7 have identical results for all 6 donors from both methods. In terms of patient-donor pairs, 30 out of 120 are inconsistent between the two methods (i.e., coincidence rate is 75%), where 20 is negative in flow cytometry but positive in MASPAT (Situation 1), while the rest 10 is just the contrary, that is, positive in flow cytometry but negative in MASPAT (Situation 2). In the 30 results with discrepancy, there are 8 with minor difference and 22 with significant difference, where 80% of Situation 2 have very remarkable difference. Despite the high inconsistency between the two methods, the final choice of compatible units is inconsistent for only 2 patients (10% of total). Conclusion: The comparison of two methods for platelet cross-matching demonstrates that MASPAT results in more positive predictions, some of which are probably due to non-specific adheresion. In fact, one patient treated with drugs in Situation 1 is proved to have no platelet antibodies using other tests. However, as sensitivity is more demanded than specificity in choosing compatible units, MASPAT is popular due to it's simplicity and rapidity. For all the discrepancies, further investigation should be carried out to elucidate which method is more accurate and useful both theoretically and clinically. -INTER- CEPT), Control units sampled D1-3 c The amustaline/GSH PR system for RBCs is not approved for commercial use. d Post shipment testing on D36-42 post-donation + and lactate were lower. Hct, Na + and glucose were similar between T and C on D35-38. T and C ATP was >2 mol/g Hb indicative of effective RBC viability, throughout storage. D35-38 hemolysis was comparable between T and C and after shipment (D36-42) the hemolysis was lower in T compared to C (Table 1) . Conclusion: Amustaline-GSH PR for RBC was successfully qualified at a regional blood center to support a large Phase 3 trial. All PR RBC components met the US criterion for hemolysis at end of storage and after shipment. All measured in vitro parameters of Amustaline-GSH RBCs indicated suitability for transfusion. Background/Case Studies: Human anelloviruses are the smallest in particle size, smallest in genome size, and least complex in genetic organization of all human pathogens. They establish a chronic persistent infection in infancy or early childhood and produce a constantly detectable load in plasma thereafter. Some studies suggest they are ubiquitous, present in >90% of the human population, and that immune surveillance is required to control the level of the virus load. Study Design/Method: Using a quantitative DNA PCR assay we recently developed that targets the most conserved region of the Anellovirus genome we examined viral loads in the plasma of HIV-negative blood donors and HIV carriers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Results/Finding: For 53 blood donors, 51 were positive with an average load of 1.49 \u00d7 10 2 copies/mL of plasma, a median value of 80.5 copies/mL plasma, ranging from 0 to 1.87 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL. For 376 HIV carriers, all were positive with an average of 6.4 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL of plasma, a median value of 2.8 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL of plasma, ranging from 4 to 1.8 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL. Conclusion: These results validate the PCR assay that was developed and confirm that detectable viral loads of around 100-200 copies were present in >90% of blood donors surveyed. In addition, HIV infection appears to reset the Anellovirus load of the average carrier approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher. The broad range of loads (approx. 10 6 copies/mL) in HIV carriers is being investigated for correlates of immune and health status. Background/Case Studies: CD34 + cell dose is an extended predictor of post-transplant hematopoietic recovery. Delayed recoveries despite a sufficient number of CD34 + are common suggesting other factors play a role in the kinetics of this process. The effect of total nucleated cells (TNC) on the engraftment remains unclear and several studies have shown conflicting results. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of TNC on the engraftment and on survival. Study Design/Method: A single-center analysis from January 2016 to December 2017 included 93 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures (53 autologous and 40 allogeneic) in 91 patients (Pts) (56% male and 44% female). The main reasons for HSCT were acute leukemia for allogeneic HSCT (n=30) and multiple myeloma for autologous HSCT (n=31). Haploidentical and cord-blood transplantation were excluded. The conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic HSCT was myeloablative (MA) in 19 Pts (48%) and non-myeloablative (NMA) in 21 (52%). The main source of stem cells was peripheral blood (97%). Results/Finding: The median TNC and CD34 + infused was 8.07 \u00d7 10 8 /Kg and 4.02 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg, respectively. In autologous HSCT, we found that higher TNC dose was correlated with faster neutrophil engraftment (p<0.001, Spearman correlation coefficient (\u03c1)=-0.524) but higher CD34 + cell doses did not have such effect. In allogeneic HSCT group, higher TNC dose was correlated with faster platelet engraftment (p<0.001, \u03c1=-0.754), either for MA (p=0.001, \u03c1=-0.737) and NMA group (p=0.001, \u03c1=-0.742), but CD34 + cell dose was not predictive of faster engraftment. In Pts receiving > 8x10 8 / Kg TNC we observed a shorter median time of neutrophil engraftment in the autologous group and a shorter time of platelet recovery in the allogeneic group (Table 1) . No statistical differences in survival outcomes were observed in any group regarding TNC dose and number of CD34+. Conclusion: In our series, a strong association between higher TNC cell dose and a shorter time of engraftment was observed. We could not demonstrate this effect with CD34 + cell dose. No impact on survival was observed with regards to the TNC and CD34 + cell dose. Background/Case Studies: West Nile virus (WNV) is a transfusion-transmissible virus. Northern hemisphere WNV lineages 1 and 2, primarily responsible for human disease, are not endemic in Australia although the less virulent WNV Kunjin strain is endemic in tropical northern regions. As Australia does not perform WNV donor screening there is a potential transfusion-transmission (TT) risk associated with donors returning from endemic/outbreak countries. To estimate this risk we have developed a probabilistic model with Monte Carlo simulation and applied it to EU and neighbouring countries for the 2017 WNV transmission season. Study Design/Method: The input parameters for each country were the probability of: 1) acquiring an asymptomatic WNV infection during the period of observation, derived from the number of reported WN fever (WNF) cases in that country and the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections (0.206, 95% CI:0.147-0.265); 2) a donor visiting each outbreak country during the period of observation, derived from the proportion of the Australian donor population visiting that country during the period of observation; 3) a returning donor donating while viraemic, based on the number of returning donors who donated within 2 weeks of leaving the outbreak country (0.172, 95% CI:0.0.095-0.249); 4) a donation being used for clinical Background/Case Studies: Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a potentially fatal complication of transfusion. In pre-clinical studies and several clinical studies, TRALI has been related to loss of product quality during red blood cell storage, called the \"storage lesion\". Donor characteristics, as for example age, genetics and sex influence this \"storage lesion\". We investigated the relation between donor characteristics and onset of TRALI. We hypothesized that donor sex, age and blood type is related to TRALI incidence. Study Design/Method: We performed a secondary analysis on the donor data from two cohort studies, which combine to one of the largest cohorts of TRALI patients to date. The first cohort consisted of a retrospective nested case control study in ICU patients, the second cohort consisted of a prospective case control study in cardiac surgery patients. Suspected TRALI was defined by using the consensus definition of ALI. We obtained donor sex, age and blood type from the national blood bank. We used kruskal-wallis testing to compare the number of transfused products and chisquare testing to compare proportions of TRALI patients and transfused control. To validate the external standard approach, three different external standard solutions were prepared (A, B and C) and tested using nine different chips in an experiment designed to evaluate the reproducibility of output results. The chip's left-hand side inlets were filled with standard A, while right-hand side inlets were filled with either standard A, B or C. The right/left flow rate ratios were used as the analytical output signal. RCC samples of different storage ages were analyzed using the external standard approach and compared with respect to their deformability. Results/Finding: Flow rates recorded for the left and right inlets were compared for each chip. The between-channels coefficient of variation (% C.V.) within the same chip was lower than 2 %, which demonstrates a high homogeneity in the channel mask used to fabricate PDMS chips. To evaluate the chip-to-chip manufacturing reproducibility, left inlets on each chip were filled standard A, and flow rates were compared. The % C.V. was < 5 %, and was deemed within the acceptable range. Finally, there were no significant differences in recorded flow rates for standards A, B or C, and the overall flow rate for the external standard solution was determined at 0.270 \u00b1 0.011 nL/s (% C.V. = 4%), which was similar to flow rates observed for RCC samples in a previous study. Conclusion: Microfluidic methods are believed to be suitable for precise and sensitive RBC deformability analysis. The development of an appropriate external standard approach can be used to address chip-to-chip variability, and the use of dye-doped carboxyl polystyrene microspheres has been found to be a reproducible method. Dexamethasone 8 mg (4 mg tablets x2) was also prescribed 12 hours prior to collection to donors without a history of eye disease. Complete blood counts were performed prior to mobilization, post-mobilization, post apheresis and of the granulocyte concentrate. The allogeneic blood donor criteria was used to qualify granulocyte donors. Statistical Analysis: Wilcoxson rank-sum tests were used to compare the distribution of the following parameters (age, weight, pre G-CSF wbc/granulocyte %/platelet count, post G-CSF wbc/platelet count, post-apheresis wbc/platelet count, donor TBV, TBV processed, run time, collection preference, granulocyte concentrate volume/total wbc/hematocrit/ANC, collection efficiency 2, % increase of wbc/ granulocyte post G-CSF, and % decrease of wbc/platelet post -apheresis) between the BMI groups. All statistical analysis were performed using R version 3.4.3. All statistical tests used a significance of 5% and no adjustments were made for multiple testing. Results/Finding: Of the 96 first time female donors, 37 (38.5%) had a normal BMI, 37(38.5%) were overweight and 22 (23%) were obese. There were only four parameters found to be of statistical significance: weight (p < 0.0001), donor's total blood volume (p<0.0001), granulocyte concentrate volume ( p<0.0001) and wbc content of the granulocyte concentrate (p=0.03). The hematocrit of the majority (95.8%) of the granulocytes concentrates collected from all three BMI groups were <5%. All of the other parameters listed above were not statistically significant. Conclusion: It is concluded that increased BMI does not correlate with a greater increase in WBC after mobilization with G-CSF + /-dexamethasone in first time female donors. The increased BMI does correlate with a larger volume of granulocyte concentrate collected with an increased total white cell content. We found that the fully automated apheresis machine allowed us to minimize red cell contamination while optimizing granulocyte collection. The data analyses is to be extended to male donors as well as repeat female/male donors to confirm our findings.",

Study Design/Method: This study was a retrospective cohort study of 1133 repeat adult volunteer allogeneic blood donors with electronic donation histories at a large community blood center. Donor birthdate, gender, donation dates, antibody screen result, and antibody specificities were obtained via electronic query of donations occurring between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2017. Antibodies were categorized as persistent, recurrent, or evanescent based on antibody screen result history. Mean time to antibody evanescence was calculated and group means were compared using a t-test or ANOVA. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered a significant difference. Results/Finding: There was no significant difference between the mean time to antibody evanescence when comparing donor gender, age, or number of antibody specificities. Donors over age 45 were significantly less likely to have evanescent antibodies compared to younger donors (p=0.023). Mean time to antibody evanescence was significantly longer for antibodies specific for Kell blood group system antigens compared to those directed against Rh, Kidd, Duffy and MNS blood group system antigens (p<0.01). Among donors with antibody evanescence, the mean time to evanescence was 748 days with a mean persistence of 322 days, suggesting the average donor antibody in the evanescent group became undetectable between 11 and 25 months following the initial positive donation. However, twenty percent of donors with positive antibody screens did not have a repeat positive donation. Donors with at least two positive donations had a mean time to evanescence of 1393 days.",

            "text": "The results of this study suggest younger donors are more likely to result a negative antibody screen on a subsequent donation compared to donors over 45 years old. The data suggest a possible initial deferral of 3 years for donors with two consecutive positive antibody screens, with a more aggressive deferral period for older donors or those with antibodies directed against antigens in the Kell system. Six of the platelets crossmatched had HLA types and were positive for an antigen to which the patient had an HLA antibody. Therefore, the platelets should have been incompatible. Given the high PRA MFI, the platelet crossmatch results were repeated using plasma diluted 1:2 and 1:3 to explore if prozone phenomena could be observed. Results/Finding: Platelet crossmatch results using plasma diluted 1:2 yielded reactivity with 3 of 10 platelets. One of the incompatible platelets was positive for B58 and B62 and the patient MFI for those antigens was approximately 2,500 and 11,000 respectively. A second incompatible platelet was positive for B27 and B50 and the MFI was approximately 6,000 and 16,000 respectively. Platelet crossmatch results using plasma diluted 1:3 yielded reactivity with one more platelet (4 of 10). The incompatible platelet resulting from the additional dilution was positive for the B49 antigen. The patient B49 antibody MFI was approximately 17,500. Three of the compatible platelets using the plasma diluted 1:3 diluted were positive for the A2 antigen, two were positive for the B44 antigen and one was positive for the B60 antigen. The antibody MFI results to these antibodies were approximately 2000, 10,000 and 11,000 respectively showing that some antibodies were not detected with normal or diluted plasma regardless of the MFI. Conclusion: In this example, platelet crossmatch using solid phase methodology showed both low sensitivity and prozone effect. Background/Case Studies: The Panther system is a fully automated platform for nucleic acid amplification testing, used in blood screening (Grifols) and diagnostics (Hologic). The assays (e.g. for HIV, HCV, HBV, ZIKV) are typically performed on plasma, with a 0.5 mL volume assayed, and 95% limit of detection (LOD) is as low as 4 IU/mL. In cases where viral load in plasma and blood compartments is expected to be very low and adequate sample volume is available, we sought to determine whether testing of multiple 0.5 mL replicates (reps), which the system can be programmed to perform automatically using 5 mL input samples, could further enhance sensitivity of detection. Study Design/Method: As a proof of concept that replicate testing could detect very low viral loads, we used 1) the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Assay to test plasma from elite controller (antibody-positive, NAT-negative) blood donors and ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals, and 2) the Aptima or Procleix Zika Virus assay to test EDTA plasma and lysed whole blood (WB) from ZIKV-infected blood donors followed longitudinally up to 1 year after index donation. HIV samples (10 or 25 mL each) were tested in 18 or 45 reps, and ZIKV plasma (5 mL each) or lysed WB (4 mL each) samples were tested in 8 or 2 reps, respectively. A total of 64 platelet crossmatches were performed using an SDP sample taken prior to PI treatment, inclusive of all patient samples, and all crossmatches were repeated using a post-PI treatment sample. Reaction strength at crossmatch (graded as \"+\" strong positive, \"w+\" weak positive and \"0\" negative) was compared between the original, non-PI treated sample and a post PI treatment sample of the same donor unit. ABO of SDP was not a consideration as only reaction strength at crossmatch was being compared. Platelet antibody screen testing had previously been done on the 14 patient samples; 2 were positive for HLA antibody only, 8 were positive for both HLA and platelet antibody and 4 were negative. Both serum and plasma patient samples were included in the 14 used for testing. Results/Finding: 6 of the 14 patient samples had a change in their crossmatch reactivity. Of the 6 samples showing a change, 3 had HLA/Platelet antibody, 2 had HLA antibody only and 1 sample was antibody negative. A decrease in reactivity strength was seen in 9 out of 64 (14.1%) of the pathogen reduced sample crossmatches, with 5 of the reactions becoming negative (7.8%). 1 crossmatch reaction (1.5%) increased in strength. (AABB, 2017 ). In the current study, the TBS was tested for room temperature shipping of WB donations, apheresis products and blood sample tubes. Study Design/Method: To mimic freshly collected products, WB collection bags (Reveos LR, TerumoBCT) were filled with 523 ml 0.9% saline at T=30\u00b0C. Additionally, apheresis platelet concentrates (PC), plasma bags (TRIMA collection set, TerumoBCT), and blood sample tubes were filled with 170 ml, 250 ml and 3 ml of 0.9% saline at 20-24\u00b0C, respectively. Monitoring probes were inserted inside the saline-filled bags to record temperature profiles. Either one or eight Reveos WB units were packed in TBS with solid-phase T=22\u00b0C PCM (Cryopak). For apheresis products, one single-(1 PC + 1 plasma) and four double-platelet donations (8 PC + 4 plasmas) were used as minimal and maximal loads, and were both tested for maximal shipping delays. A single blood sample tube was packed in TBS to represent a limiting condition. All TBS configurations were exposed to extreme winter (T=-35\u00b0C) and summer (T=40\u00b0C) conditions for up to 24h (n=3) in designed experiments. Results/Finding: The TBS uses T=22\u00b0C PCM to allow rapid cooling of blood products (\u0394t = 30 to 48 min) and to maintain internal temperature of one to eight Reveos WB donations between 18-24\u00b0C for 8.2h \u00b1 0.5h and >24h under extreme external temperatures. The use of PCM allows both minimal and maximal apheresis donation products to stay within their acceptable holding temperature range (20-24\u00b0C) for 3h and 19h when exposed to extreme winter and summer conditions, respectively. Finally, blood tubes exposed to the same external temperature conditions maintain internal temperatures between 18\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C for 6.5h and 18.5h, respectively. Conclusion: The VIP box and PCM allow the thermoregulation box system to be used for extended shipping periods under extreme temperature conditions. Because of its increased internal volume, the box can accept more products, at the expense of additional PCM and an increased total weight. In conclusion, this thermoregulation box system was designed to use combinations of PCM to meet specific requirements regarding packaging and transport of blood products, especially in winter conditions.",

            "text": "In addition to the benefit of collecting a \"free\" plasma component, the reduced incidence of plasma-associated reactions has been reported in the Background/Case Studies: The present study was conducted to find out the prevalence of viral hepatitis markers among blood donors deferred on the basis of a history of hepatitis related risk factors, compare it with the prevalence in accepted blood donors and assess the impact of such a deferral on blood safety. Knowing the natural history of HBV and HCV asymptomatic window period, chronic carrier stage, genetic diversity, mutants and cryptic/occult infection and that during this the potential of transmission through blood transfusion remains. Therefore need to garner data as evidence to support for deferral for elicitable history of presence risk factors related to development of hepatitis in the interest of blood safety was realized. Study Design/Method: Observational study recruiting 1000 deferred blood donors deferred on the basis of a history of hepatitis related risk factors and carried out serology and ID-NAT for hepatitis B and hepatitis C after obtaining written informed consent. History of jaundice, tattooing/ body piercings, surgery/dental extraction, contact with persons having hepatitis, high risk behavior, blood transfusions/transplantations or immunoglobulin administration. The study participation was voluntary non-random. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the institute. Results/Finding: 18 (1.8%) out of 100 deferred blood donors were reactive on ELISA, 8 were reactive for HBsAg; whereas 10 for anti-HCV antibodies. 17 (1.7%) were initial reactive on ID-NAT, 15 discriminated on further testing; 8 for HBV, 7 for HCV. 9 were reactive for hepatitis B, out of which 7 were concordant positive for HBsAg ELISA and NAT, whereas one was NAT yield and one was sero-yield. Out of 9 hepatitis B reactive, 7 (77.8%) had history of jaundice, one (11.1%) had history of tattooing and one (11.1%) had history of high risk behavior. 12 were hepatitis C reactive, out of which 5 were concordant anti-HCV ELISA and NAT reactive, while 5 were sero yield and two were NAT yield. Out of the 12 deferred donors reactive for hepatitis C majority had history of jaundice (83.3%) followed by high risk behavior (16.3%). Total 23 donors had viral markers for either hepatitis B or hepatitis C in the present study. Therefore the potential of deferral on a history of hepatitis related risk factors could interdict about 2-3 HBV and/or HCV reactive blood donors from entering the quarantine blood supply per 100 donors. Correlations between ATP and DPG were poor for all additives except for PAG3M, suggesting a rewiring of the Rapoport-Luebering shunt specific to this additive. In addition, deaminated purines such as hypoxanthine were predictive of hemolysis and morphological alterations. Guanosine supplementation in PAGGSM and PAG3M fueled ATP generation by feeding into non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway via phosphoribolysis. Decreased urate to hypoxanthine ratios were observed in alkaline additives, suggetive of decreased generation of urate from purine degradation, and as a consequence less formation of hydrogen peroxide by xanthine oxidase activity. Despite the many benefits observed in purine and redox metabolism, alkaline additives did not prevent accumulation of free fatty acids and oxidized byproducts, opening a window for future alkaline formulations including (lipophilic) antioxidants. Conclusion: Alkalinization via different strategies (replacement of chloride anions with either high bicarbonate, high citrate/phosphate or membrane impermeant gluconate) results in different metabolic outcomes, in all cases superior to current canonical additives. The results from our metabolic analyses indicate superior preserving of RBC in PAG3M over the other alkaline additives and, in general, of alkaline additives over non-alkaline SAGM and PAGGSM. In particular, DPG and ATP generation and maintenance, as well as purine metabolism and redox homeostasis (especially the PPP and its non-oxidative phase byproducts) were favorable in PAG3M and other alkaline additives in comparison to SAGM and PAGGSM. However, the observed metabolic benefits do not extend to the prevention of storageinduced fatty acid release and lipid oxidation. Results from the present study provide additional insights in the metabolic benefits of alkaline storage additives and will likely guide the formulation of novel additives in the near future.",

Disinfection and cleaning of venipuncture site, hand, and surface were the key components to successful control the hygiene of blood bank, including cord blood bank. Besides bacterial enumeration, monitoring of bacterial pathogens should be performed to reduce the risk of transfusion-associated septic, referring to Hygienic Standard for Disinfection in Hospitals of China (GB15982-2012). Conventional methods, such as culture and biochemical methods were inconvenient because of the time and experience they require to identify the presence of pathogenic bacteria.The aim of this study was to develop an isothermal real-time Recombinase-Aided Amplification (RT-RAA) assay to improving the efficiency of bacterial pathogen identification. Study Design/Method: In this study, we designed specific primers and fluorescence probes in conserved region of four pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) for RT-RAA assay. DNA of the four baceria was isolated from aliquots of culture mediums with an efficient extraction method.",

To evaluate the sensitivity of this method, each of the four pathogenic bacteria cultures of various concentrations from 1 \u00d7 10 6 to 10 CFU/mL in inoculated surface samples was amplified and detected by RT-RAA. Assay specificity was validated by using other 10 bacteria and 5 fungi. The performance of the RT-RAA assay was further evaluated with skin and surface samples taken by sterile swabs during blood collection and production to obtain a microbiological profile of the manufacturing condition. All results were compared with culture and biochemical method as standard. Results/Finding: Combined with fluorescent probes for real-time detection, the RAA assay could reliably detect as few as 100 CFU/mL in pure culture of the four pathogenic bacteria at a constant temperature (37-39\u00b0C) within 15 min, up to 10-fold more sensitive than that of conventional method. The assay was successfully used to amplify and detect DNA of samples taken from skin and surface, and was no cross-reaction with other tested bacteria and fungi. Sixty samples (thirty skin samples and 30 surface samples) were respectively analyzed with conventional culture method and RT-RAA assay. In 30 skin samples, two samples taken from hands of staff were detected for Staphylococcus aureus with RT-RAA assay, which were consistent with the conventional method. Conclusion: The data presented in our study indicated that RT-RAA can provide rapid, sensitive and specific detection of pathogen in skin and surface samples without prior isolation and characterization of the bacteria by conventional methods. The RT-RAA assay can serve as an alternative tool to culture and biochemical method for the screening of pathogenic bacteria. The results obtained by the RT-RAA and plate counts based on culture method showed that environment and skin surface in areas of blood collection and production is potentially contaminated with pathogen and could be a potential risk for the blood products. Background/Case Studies: Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum which could be transmitted by sexual contact, blood transfusion or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus. Since 1985 in Colombia is mandatory the screening for T. pallidum in all blood donations. Several studies demonstrated that active syphilis infections potentiate transmission of HIV and is related to a higher probability of coinfection with other pathogens potentially transmitted by blood. The aim of this study was to identify syphilis coinfection with virus associated to sexual transmission in Colombian blood donations Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis of blood donations reactive for syphilis, HIV, HCV, HBV and HTLV collected from January 2015 to December 2016 by the 82 certified blood banks at the national level was made. The confirmatory test for HIV, HCV, and HTLV was immunoblot. ",

Most regulatory agencies have established clear standards for RCC hemolysis at the end of storage; however, there is no recommendation for a specific methodology regarding supernatant hemoglobin (Hb) measurements. 1 In a recent study, significant differences were observed for RCC hemolysis rates depending on the analytical approach that was used. The aim of this study was to compare RCC hemolysis results obtained with different methods. Study Design/Method: In the first part of the study, SAGM-RCC (n=42) were stored for 42 days before proceeding to supernatant Hb measurement under three conditions. For Series 1, a CBC was performed with a hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter Ac-T\u21225diff ) on RCC samples prior to centrifugation (1430xg, 25 min). Sample tubes from Series 2 were centrifuged as for Series 1, but CBC measurements were omitted. For Series 3, samples were subjected to hard spin conditions for a shorter time (5000xg, 7 min). For each Series, supernatants were filtered (0.22 \u03bcm) and Hb was measured using the HemoCue Plasma/Low Hb system, following the manufacturer's recommendations. In the second part of the study, supernatants were obtained from RCC (n=16) and blood samples (n=5), as mentioned for Series 2. Then, the Harboe method (UV-vis wavelengths were 415, 380 and 450 nm, 1-cm optical path length) and the HemoCue system were both used to measure free Hb and calculate hemolysis rates.",

Although the presence of HAV RNA in blood donors is known to be very low, HAV antibody prevalence in this population is unknown. Study Design/Method: Samples from 5001 US blood donors collected primarily in the Midwestern US in 2015 were tested for the presence of HAV IgG and IgM antibodies using chemiluminescent microparticles immunoassays on the Architect platform (Abbott Laboratories). Results/Finding: The overall prevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 60%. Previous studies using samples collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed a decrease in prevalence from 33% to 24% (1988 to 2012); however, NHANES includes individuals \u22655 years of age and older. Only one specimen was anti-HAV IgM positive (and confirmed) for a prevalence of 0.02%. This specimen was HAV RNA negative. Anti-HAV IgG prevalence among donors 16 to 19 years was 67%, dropped to 54% among donors aged 40 to 49 years and increased to 70% among donors aged 80 to 93 years. The high prevalence among 16 to 19 year olds is likely due to infant vaccination recommendations initiated in 1999. No difference was seen by sex with overall anti-HAV IgG prevalence of 61% and 60% for males and females, respectively. Among the five states with the highest number of donors only anti-HAV IgG prevalence in Missouri (65%) was significantly higher than the prevalence in Illinois (52%) and Kentucky (59%) (P < 0.01).

            "text": "Defining Background/Case Studies: It is a goal for the staff of the American Rare Donor Program (ARDP) to ensure that all requests for rare blood from the 90 ARDP members are filled. It is important to know about requests for rare blood that were not filled. Each unfilled request for rare blood may delay a patient's treatment or may result in continued low hemoglobin which may put the patient at risk. The process is that the ARDP members request rare units. ARDP staff sends two faxes to ARDP members with registered rare donors of the type requested. If not completely successful in finding units, an email requesting recruitment is sent to domestic ARDP members with registered donors. If the request is still unfilled, the next step would be a consultation with the facility and the ARDP's Medical Directors. Finally, after meeting the FDA IND requirements for an international request (patient and physician permissions, autologous donation not possible, no or insufficient eligible siblings, and MMA results), a request is made to the WHO International Rare Donor Panel. Study Design/Method: A review of the unfilled requests from 2017 was performed. Evaluation criteria included phenotype, ABO/Rh, number of units requested and the patient's diagnosis. Results/Finding: In researching both the requests and responses, there were 24 unfilled requests of 787 total requests 2017 (3%). The diagnosis in 11 of the patients was sickle cell disease (SCD), 14 were for phenotypes more prevalent in donors of African descent. The number of units requested ranged from 1-6 units with an average of 2 per order. Of the 24 unfilled requests, 2 were cancelled within an average of 2 days. Fourteen of 24 requests (57%) were for O positive units. Five of the requests were for RH allele-matched units and 2 were for IgA-deficient plasma. Five (20.8%) of the 24 unfilled orders were for units negative for multiple antigens and thirteen (54%) for antigens of very high prevalence. Conclusion: The ARDP members collaborate very effectively in filling request for rare blood with a 97% fill rate, but 3% (24 requests) were not filled in 2017. Monitoring unfilled requests is important to determine the reasons these requests remained unfilled and the patient population that is impacted. The data collected indicated that 41.7 % of unfilled requests were for patients with SCD. The majority (87.5 %) of these requests were associated with cancelled orders or patients being discharged without transfusion. The impact of the lack of transfusion to the patients' lives are unknown. These findings prompted the ARDP to take action to develop and implement an outcome form to collect information regarding the impact of unfilled orders.",

NT revert to negative with successful treatment and in many late infections. With the need for approximately 32,000 units of blood each day in the USA and less than 10% of the population donating, unnecessary deferral of donors due to persisting reactivity from remote S who are noninfectious, identified by T followed by NT (the \"reverse algorithm\") needs to be reassessed. This reverse algorithm replaced the traditional diagnostic algorithm (NT testing confirmed by T) in transfusion medicine after automation of only T. With the introduction of an automated NT method, the use of the traditional algorithm can be evaluated as the preferred method of screening blood donors to reduce deferrals from individuals that have had S in the past but are no longer infectious. Study Design/Method: 3757 serum and plasma specimens with concordant T and NT results were tested with the ASI Evolution Automated RPR Analyzer using ASI RPR Carbon Antigen. Samples were sourced from blood banks and plasma centers. Samples also included 250 nonreactive S specimens and 30 reactive S specimens from pregnant women, and 143 clinically diagnosed reactive specimens, both treated and untreated, from public health departments and tested by RPR and T to establish expected results. The reactive samples ranged in reactivity from minimal 1:1 titers to 1:64 titers by RPR. The ages of the patients ranged in age from 15 to 72 years old and included both male and female. Results/Finding: Of the 3757 specimens, 1629 were reactive and 2128 specimens were nonreactive by RPR. The ASI Evolution identified 1629 of the 1629 reactive specimens as reactive and 2128 of the 2128 nonreactive specimens as nonreactive. There was a 100% positive agreement with a 95%CI of 98.77 -100% and 100% negative agreement with a 95% CI of 99.83 -100%. Conclusion: For years NT was the standard for screening blood donors. NT was displaced by automated T. With the availability of an automated NT analyzer and the data presented, NT testing should be reevaluated as the primary donor screening test to decrease deferral rates due to noninfectious S with persistently reactive T.",

Background/Case Studies: Our flow cytometry unit determines peripheral blood CD34 + cell count before hematopoietic progenitor cell-apheresis (HPC-A). When pre-apheresis CD34 + cell count is > 5 cells/\u03bcL the procedure is started. This same pre-apheresis sample is analyzed afterwards in the stem cell processing laboratory. Although we have used the UKNEQAS CD34 + stem cell enumeration programme as external quality assessment in the past, we set out to assess the correlation between the CD34 + cell count obtained in our flow cytometry unit and that obtained in the processing laboratory in order to replace the current external quality assessment as a costsaving measure, particularly given that the processing laboratory also subscribes to the UKNEQAS CD34 + stem cell enumeration programme. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively analyzed the correlation between the CD34 + cell count obtained in our unit and the stem cell processing laboratory from January 2017 until April 2018. The flow cytometer, antibodies and erythrocyte lysis solution used in our unit are: FC500 with CXP software, anti-CD45-FITC (clone J33) / anti-CD34 PE (clone 581), all from Beckman Coulter, and PharmLyse (Becton-Dickinson). The flow cytometer, antibodies and erythrocyte lysis solution used in the stem cell processing laboratory are: FACSCalibur with Cellquest software (Becton-Dickinson), anti-CD45-FITC (clone J33) / anti-CD34 PE (clone 8G12), from Beckman-Coulter / 7-AADD (Becton-Dikinson) and QuicklysisTM. For absolute cell count, out unit uses Flow Count Fluorospheres (Beckman-Coulter) and the processing laboratory Perfect Count Microspheres (Cytognos). The passing-bablok regression was used to compare the two laboratories and a Bland-Altman plot was used to assess the agreement between them. Finally, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between the results obtained in our flow cytometry unit and in the stem cell processing laboratory. Results/Finding: The Passing-Bablok regression did not show a deviation from linearity between the two laboratories (y=-1,05 + 0,86x; p=0,44) and the Bland-Altman analysis did not show a bias in CD34 + cell count. Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.951 (95% confidence interval: 0.916 -components. Diversion of the first 10-40 mL of whole blood post-venipuncture is now an established practice and an effective strategy in mitigating the incidence of skin flora related blood product contamination. Previous data suggest that additional sample diversion beyond current measures would further reduce bacterial load to the blood collection/separation system but this has not been extensively studied. This study sought to evaluate the bacterial content of blood fractions collected from a contaminated source (injection site) up to an additional 100 mL beyond today's practice (diversion volume of $30 mL) through use of a simple in vitro model system. Study Design/Method: Model System Preparation -A model diversion line, similar to that of Wagner et al (Transfusion 2000) , was constructed using the inlet line from a double needle apheresis platelet collection kit (4R2355, Fresenius Kabi). Luer locks were added in place of the sample diversion pouch and at approx.10 cm past the second Y-site. Test Article Preparation and Evaluation -The injection site of a sterile bag containing whole blood (ACD-A anticoagulant) was inoculated with a minimum of 5E7 CFU from an overnight S. epidermis culture. Upon drying, the needle from the model diversion line was inserted through the inoculated area. Aliquots of blood were taken via syringes from the luer positioned in place of the diversion pouch (3, 10 mL aliquots). After the 3 rd sample, the line was sealed at the first Y-site and aliquots were then drawn through the second luer (20, 5 mL aliquots). Bacteria concentration in each fraction was determined using the pour plate method, and the total CFU in each fraction calculated. Results/Finding: Overall results for total CFU in each fraction show continued reduction of bacterial load with increasing volume collected/diverted (n=5). Data for the first 30 mL collected from the diversion line are consistent with those published by Wagner et al, showing that most bacteria are removed in the first fractions collected. Subsequent fractions show continued reduction of bacterial load resulting in an additional 1-3 log decrease from the initial 30 mL diversion.",

Sensitivity was 100% for anti-HIV-1 (1,016/1,016), 100% for anti-HIV-2 (232/232) and 100% for HIV-1 antigen positive samples (35/35). Sensitivity was 100% for 53 antigen positive viral isolate samples. Seroconversion sensitivity was better than the licensed comparator assay with 42 reactive samples detected with the Alinity s assay and 24 reactive samples detected by the comparator assay. Analytical sensitivity ranged from 0.80 IU/ml to 0.83 IU/ml.",

Also, the assay provided better seroconversion sensitivity than the licensed comparator assay. Background/Case Studies: In order to provide plasma for component therapy, whole blood goes through a series of manufacturing steps and is visually inspected for acceptability. A standard guide for performing visual inspection would be beneficial to improve consistency. There is no regulatory standard for plasma color or red blood cell (RBC) concentration in plasma, so it was necessary to first determine an acceptable cut-off which could then be used to develop a visual inspection aid. Study Design/Method: To determine the best cut-off between acceptable vs unacceptable plasma, a visual representation was created. Plasma units of similar size and color were injected with RBCs in incremental volumes ranging from 0.05mL -0.50mL. The plasma units were laid out in increasing RBC concentration. Techs and management inspected the plasma units to determine a common visual cut-off. The RBC concentration in the plasma was calculated based on whole blood with an average hematocrit of 45% (5 \u00d7 10 9 RBCs/mL),then doubled for a unit of packed RBCs to determine the number of RBCs injected into the units. Once the cut-off was determined, photos were taken of the plasma units and used to create a visual inspection aid. Results/Finding: The visual cut-off determined by techs and management fell between the 0.10mL and 0.15mL injected plasma units. Only one source was found that mentions a limitation of RBCs in plasma. It is a specification of <4 \u00d7 10 6 RBCs/mL in the package insert for our pathogen reduction technology for platelets, so it was used as a guideline. The 0.1mL unit was determined to have a concentration of 3.3 \u00d7 10 6 RBCs/mL. A visual inspection aid was produced and implemented in the component laboratory. During the initial use, 650 plasma units were inspected with 98% of plasma passing the visual inspection. The aid was then made available to the two hospital blood banks. Since the initial implementation, a flaw in our calculation was discovered and our visual cut-off has now been determined to have a concentration of 2.2 \u00d7 10 6 RBCs/mL. A survey indicated that 84% of respondents use the inspection aid, 87% believe that it is helpful in determining plasma acceptability and 92% expressed opinions on how the aid improved plasma inspection. It was found useful in training and gives new techs confidence to make inspection decisions.",

An additional 7 requests were for RBC units lacking other high prevalence antigens including Co a , Lu b , Di b , Jo a , Jr a , PPIP K and Ko. Even a request for RBCs for an AB + recipient, universal recipient based on ABO/Rh, was unable to be filled due to the rarity of the type (e-U-). One request was for a C-E-K-Fy(a-) RHCE allele match (RHCE*ce733G/RHCE*ce733G). Conclusion: Some requests for RBC units of rare type are submitted specifically for liquid units only. Of these, 92% were filled with liquid units. Of those unable to be filled with liquid units, 6 out of the 15 involved the U antigen and an additional 7 involved other high prevalence antigens. For these requests, frozen rare units were utilized to fill the gap when liquid units were not available. Without those frozen units, patients would not have received their transfusion in a timely manner. Because of potential delays associated with recruiting and collecting a rare donor, ARDP advises centers who request liquid units only to review the patients clinical course to determine if transfusion is eminently required and to reconsider if frozen units should be requested.",

Metrics were collected to determine the effects of implementing an automated track laboratory system on the number of samples processed per shift, the time to perform pre-analytical processing, turn-around time for sample testing, quality related issues, and the number of employees required to perform testing. Study Design/Method: Implementation of automation in the production laboratory occurred in two phases. Phase one was the integration of middleware across all primary testing platforms. Phase two involved fully automating the pre-analytical part of our testing process by installing a Track Automation System. This system included automation of the input of samples into the system, centrifugation, decapping, resealing and storage of sample tubes. Some analytical work was also automated by placing chemistry and immunoassay analyzers directly on the track system.

Quarantine storage including retesting the donor for HIV, HBV and HCV after 4 month is one routinely used method with an at least 4 month delay in a possible release process. Opposite, pathogen inactivation (PI) techniques allow an immediate use of the treated units after two to three days. However, PI means additional manipulation of the plasma with possible loss of coagulation factors during production and subsequent storage. Therefore, we studied influence of PI (Methylene Blue and Intercept) on factor I and VIII, the most common used quality parameters for frozen plasma, and compared the results with untreated stored plasma in a paired system. Study Design/Method: We produced 6 pools of 5 plasma units each and split each pool into three arms: Intercept treated plasma (IN), Methylene Blue (MB) treated plasma and untreated plasma (UP). Plasma was frozen immediately after inactivation and Fibrinogen and factor VIII was analyzed after 2 month, 1 year and 2 years. We report here our findings for factor loss, differences between both PI methods and between PI treated units However, difference was also not significant, but IN levels were significantly lower than UP (p < 0.05). Stability of both factors within the groups, defined as changes of values between 2 month and 2 years of freezing was given for Fibrinogen (p = 0.729) and factor VIII (p = 0.279) between the three arms. Conclusion: Manipulation of plasma, as caused by pathogen inactivation technique, leads to significant loss of factor I and VIII compared with not manipulated plasma. However, additional loss during the frozen state over 2 years is similar in all three arms and therefore not increased by PI techniques. Taking into account, that mean volume of an MB treated plasma is 250 mL whereas IN treated plasma is about 200 mL, the total content of both factors in the transfused unit is significantly higher in the MB group which can influence the total number of transfused units per patient.",

Acker 1,2 . 1 Centre for Innovation, Canadian Blood Services, 2 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta Background/Case Studies: Rare red cell concentrates (RCCs) are frequently cryopreserved and stored at \u2264-65\u00b0C using the high glycerol method with slow freezing rates. Prior to transfusion, thawed units must have the glycerol removed. This methodology can also be applied to reagent red blood cells (RBCs) to provide cells for testing purposes, avoiding liquid nitrogen storage. However, the deglycerolization process for RCCs requires extensive washing steps which when translated to a small 1 mL model are very labour intensive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a simplified wash process to provide a more practical deglycerolization method for reagent or small volume RBC cryopreservation. Study Design/Method: A RCC was glycerolized to a final concentration of 40% with supernatant reduction pre and post glycerolization. Glycerolized RBCs were aliquoted in 1 mL volumes into cryovials that were placed into a -80\u00b0C freezer for a minimum of 48 hours. Prior to deglycerolization the samples were thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath. Two deglycerolization processes were performed (n=9/process). Process 1 involved four wash steps (12% and 1.6% Saline, 1.6% Saline, and two washes in 0.9% Saline/0.2% Dextrose). Process 2 involved three wash steps achieved by increasing the volume of the wash solutions, eliminating the fourth wash step. All RBC samples were suspended in AS-3 post processing. Hemoglobin loss, hemoglobin recovery and glycerol concentration were determined. Additional samples were deglycerolized and tested for RBC hemolysis after 24, 48, and 72 hours of hypothermic storage (n=6/test point/process). Results/Finding: Both processes yielded approximately 1 mL of deglycerolized RBCs with hematocrits of 47 \u00b1 2% with < 1% glycerol concentrations in all samples. Hemoglobin recovery for Process 2 was 96 \u00b1 3% which was comparable to Process 1 at 97 \u00b1 3% (p=0.5). RBCs, post deglycerolization, stored at 1 to 6\u02daC for 24, 48 and 72 hours prepared using Process 1 had hemolysis of 0.47 \u00b1 0.13%, 0.47 \u00b1 0.04%, and 0.62 \u00b1 0.18%, respectively. Process 2 RBCs had hemolysis of 0.32 \u00b1 0.04%, 0.43 \u00b1 0.06%, and 0.38 \u00b1 0.05% at the same time points. When comparing Process 1 and 2 samples stored at corresponding time points there was a significant difference observed at 24 and 72 hours (p<0.05). Conclusion: A simplified 3-step deglycerolization method can successfully deglycerolize small volumes of RBCs. When RBCs are suspended in AS-3 post processing these samples can be stored hypothermically for 3 days increasing their utility as reagent cells or for small volume transfusions. .001 (4 cases were confirmed by neutralization, one case was identified as non-confirmable); HCV (EIA and NAT) = 0.001; HIV (EIA and NAT)=0.002 (one case was confirmed and two cases were identified as indeterminate); HTLV=0.0008; Serologic test for Syphilis=0.001 (two cases were confirmed as positive); and WNV=0.001. The U.S. Army Rangers account for 3,479 screening events, or roughly 46% of all U.S. Army prescreening events. The 75th Ranger Regiment has elected to screen only the blood type O donors for eligibility into this program. This program has identified a 97% accuracy in the selfreported blood type O of the U.S. Army Rangers. 3% of U.S. Army Rangers presenting for this program as blood type O were non-blood group O. Conclusion: The screening of \"Walking Blood Bank\" donors before deployment can mitigate the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases, as well as provide identification of any non-blood group O donors. Screening Walking blood bank donors informs Military medical leaders on the front lines and assists in decisions regarding donor eligibility for providing fresh whole blood (FWB) in far-forward and austere environments. Use of FWB at the Point of Injury (POI) can decrease the mortality of \"potentially survivable\" casualties. The screening of potential donors extends the availability of whole blood on the battlefield. Background/Case Studies: Project focused on improvements to whole blood component manufacturing, including process standardization to increase plasma yield, reduce waste, and streamline workflow by introducing the CompoMat G5 into production. Study Design/Method: A comprehensive G5 evaluation was conducted by the Biologics Manufacturing team. Process included completion of SOPs, training, qualifications, validations, implementation and optimization of equipment. Data was collected using OneBlood's proprietary BECS, RSA, and reviewed after evaluation and 4 months post implementation. Plasma volumes were compared between manual and G5 processing. Throughput was measured by timing operators to unload a completed unit and reload a new spun WB unit on the same G5. Multiple G5s were unloaded/reloaded for one hour. To allow for a realistic, full day labor load; throughput calculation was reduced to 75% of the measured data. Data evaluated 4 months post implementation was collected from two sites. Results/Finding: G5 was customized to use select detectors and tested with 3 bag systems from two vendors and seven component processes (hard/soft spins, source leukocytes, pediatric RBCs, AS5 RBCs, secondary process for single Cryo, single RDPs/FSC). Plasma yields increased overall with G5 compared to manual process. Yields varied by process type, centrifugation speed, and site. Using HAE RCPL bag system, initial soft spin and secondary hard spin for RDPs, a 4.8% increase in plasma yield was achieved. Using HAE RC2D bag system, initial hard spin and secondary hard spin (after freeze/thaw) for Cryo, plasma initially increased by 1.6% during the evaluation and by 6% after 4 month post implementation at both sites. Average throughput depended on average time an operator unloaded and reloaded a unit on a G5. Time variance observed depended on bag system complexity, practice, and number of G5s used. Two operators at 75% workload on 3 G5s produced highest throughput (81/hour) for secondary processes (single Cryo and single RDP). 69 units were produced per hour on hard spin process (RC2D bag type). Two operators and six G5s produced Background/Case Studies: Plateletpheresis units must be stored 20-24 C to maintain viability during storage making the units susceptible to bacterial growth that could be life-threatening or fatal for a patient. Since 2003 all units collected at our center were cultured before release to identify a unit possibly dangerous for the transfusion recipient. This review of that process illustrates its effectiveness and gives insight into the risk of the culture and release process. Study Design/Method: Product records were reviewed from June, 2003 when the culturing process was initiated, through March of 2018. Plateletpheresis units were held for 24 hours, then sampled and cultured using a rapid microbiological test system for aerobic culture. Cultures were held throughout the 5 day life of the products. Units were available to the inventory after culture. An immediate notification system by FAX was in place to every customer for notification of unit recalls as needed. A notice was sent immediately when a sample became positive. The culture bottles giving a positive report were sent to a nearby university microbiology laboratory for Gram stain, subculture and identification. Positives were evaluated as to probable source. If Gram stain and subculture were negative or no growth, the culture was classified as false positive. Notification of the culture outcome was then sent to customers if the shipped unit was reported as transfused.",

Waived cultures were exceptional release units that were required for immediate transfusion for a designated patient. Not Tested units were a failure in the process and were discarded. All positive culture products triggered actions that included discard from blood center inventory and 14 of the true positive collections were discarded by this process, or notifications to the facilities receiving the positive culture products instructing them to return or discard the units. These facilities were notified again regarding the outcome of further testing on units that were reported as transfused. Of the 24 collections found to be true culture positive, 10 were already shipped. Five of the collections were returned and discarded. Five of the positive culture units were transfused. No notifications of transfusion reactions were received for any of the units. Conclusion: Notifications to the 10 receiving facilities of true positives were successful and acknowledged. Of the 24 true positives, 19 were likely skin or environmental contaminants, and this group contained the transfused units. The more significant donor-associated positive cultures (5 collections) were all intercepted prior to shipment and removed from inventory. Culturing of plateletpheresis units after a 24 hour hold in conjunction with a robust communication system connecting to facilities receiving shipped blood components was an effective deterrent to bacterial contamination adverse events for the last 15 years. Enhanced culture techniques may add additional assurance to prevention of adverse events from contaminated platelets.",

A program to have donors drink water and eat salted snacks before donating was implemented on June 11 th 2017. The aim of this study is to measure the effect of the water/salted snack distribution on rates of VVR with and without loss of consciousness (LOC). Study Design/Method: Pre-implementation (PRE) was the 9-month period prior to implementation (11 Sep 2016 -10 Jun 2017) and post-implementation (POST) as the 9-month period following implementation (11 Jun 2017-10 Mar 2018). In PRE, donors were informed at registration to drink water before donating. Amount was not mentioned and supply varied from an empty glass the donor had to fill at a water tank, a 200-ml juice box, a 500ml water bottle or nothing at all. Snacks were offered after donation and were mostly sugary. On June 11 th 2017 a program was introduced at all collection sites with leaflets, posters and pictograms to inform donors on importance of drinking water and eating salted snacks. They were given a 500-ml water bottle and a bag of salted pretzels at arrival, were told to drink the whole bottle before donating and to eat the pretzels. Check points monitored consumption at registration, interview and venipuncture. Reinforcement was made at all check points if the bottle was not empty. All severities of VVR were reported on a standardized form. Rates of all VVR and VVR-LOC were calculated per 100 donations. PRE-POST rates were compared using chi-square tests. Results/Finding: There was a significant reduction in the number (PRE:11,609; POST:9873) and rates of all VVRs (see table) . Risk reduction was 13.8% (95%CI:11.5-16.0) for VVR and 11.4% (95%CI:1.5-20.3) for VVR-LOC. Conclusion: Capturing all severities of VVRs allows for quick evaluation of prevention program. For whole blood donors having a structured program for water and salted snacks delivery at blood collection sites significantly reduces the incidence of VVRs for both sexes and all age groups. It improves donor safety, making donation experience better and more likely for donors to return. this reactivity may mask clinically significant underlying alloantibodies. DTT treatment is a well-documented remedy for this interference; however, some blood banks have struggled to bring this protocol in-house and instead, send the test out to a reference lab at a great expense in terms of cost and turn-around time (TAT). The purpose of this study was to compare the inhouse DTT protocol versus the reference lab protocol in terms of cost and turn-around time. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively reviewed all blood bank patients on daratumumab therapy from February 2016 to April 2018. We included all patients on which a type and screen was performed during the study period. We collected the following data: age, sex, date daratumumab started, total number of type and screens, location of testing and TAT of testing. Patients that had no type and screens performed were excluded from the analysis. From February 2016 to December 2017, all type and screen samples were sent to our reference laboratory for testing, at a cost of approximately $325 per test. From January 2018 to current, we use our validated DTT in-house protocol for testing, at a cost of approximately $28 dollars per test (including tech time and reagent cost). Results/Finding: During the study-period, we were notified about 72 daratumumab patients that might require transfusion. We excluded 17 patients from the analysis due to lack of a type and screen ordered, leaving 55 patients for analysis. Samples were sent to the reference lab 124 times and were tested in house 28 times. The average TAT for the reference lab was 19 hours and 25 minutes compared to our in-house TAT of 5 hours and 9 minutes. This equates to a time savings of 14 hours and 16 minutes on average. In total, we spent approximately $38,350 for 117 samples tested at the reference lab versus $785 for in-house testing of 27 samples. Conclusion: After validating our in-house DTT protocol, we significantly decreased our TAT for type and screens on our daratumumab patient population. Additionally, we experienced significant cost savings by bringing the DTT testing in-house as compared to sending samples out to a reference laboratory. By bringing this testing in-house, we also significantly reduced the time to blood availability for this patient population.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: While blood donation is relatively safe, adverse events occur due to the insertion of a large bore needle, the physiologic response to the loss of roughly 500 ml of blood and/or the underlying condition of the donor. The most common adverse event (AE), vasovagal reactions (VVR), usually resolves spontaneously or with minimal medical intervention. When loss of consciousness (LOC) accompanies VVR, the donor may fall risking injury. While most falls do not result in significant injury (SI), some injuries require further medical intervention. Study Design/Method: We analyzed allogeneic apheresis and WB needlein collections between 6/1/2016 to 12/31/2017 (19 months). Vasovagal events were identified and any cases reported to have significant injuries based on classification by Medical Director consistent with AABB definitions were reported. Significant injury categories include closed head injuries/ concussions, dental injuries, fractures, lacerations and motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Record review was performed on reported cases of closed head injury to include those diagnosed as having concussion. Rates of significant injuries were calculated per 10,000 needle-in (NI) allogeneic donations overall and as a proportion of LOC events. Results/Finding: There were 1,319,625 allogeneic needle-in donations with 14,970 VVR (rate 113.4/10,000 NI), including 2834 LOC (rate 21.5/10,000 NI) reactions. There were 50 SI events from 45 donations with rate of 0.34/10,000 NI donations or 1.6/10,000 LOC reactions. The highest rates were for laceration (0.15/10,000 NI) and concussion (0.10/10,000 NI) and the lowest was MVA (0.02/10,000 NI). Females suffered more injuries than males (0.5/10,000 and 0.2,10,000 respectively, p=0.0093; young donors (<23 yo) had more injuries than older donors (>23 yo) (0.9/10,000 and 0.2/10,000, respectively, p<0.0001); and first time donors had more injuries than repeat donors (0.7/10,000 and 0.3/10,000 respectively, p<0.001). There were no significant differences in injuries between young male and young female donors or between older male and older female donors. Forty-three of 45 donors sought further medical intervention for their injury; exceptions were a donor with a small laceration and a donor with a broken tooth who was lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Significant injuries are very rare events and were associated with LOC in the cases recorded. Significant injuries almost always require further medical intervention with resulting incurred costs. Continued donor vigilance and safety measures to prevent LOC will help mitigate these potentially avoidable events.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The PGDprime rapid test for bacteria in platelets was developed as an improvement of the PGD\u00ae test currently used as a Safety Measure for platelet transfusion. It was designed to provide a simpler test procedure compared to the current product. The current PGD test employs intact IgG capture and detector antibodies and as such is vulnerable to a very low rate of false positive results with samples containing high levels of heterophile antibodies and rheumatoid factor. The new PGDprime test incorporates intact IgG for capture and F(ab') 2 fragments for detector antibodies for 5 out of 6 test lines, as well as a more stringent sample preparation regime, to further reduce the already low false positive (FP) rate. Study Design/Method: The specificity of the new test was evaluated in a limited study testing 624 culture-negative individual platelet units or pools of various types. Sample types included leukocyte-reduced apheresis platelets in plasma, leukocyte-reduced whole blood derived platelets (LR-WBDP), leukocyte-reduced whole blood derived platelet pools (LR Pools, pre-storage or post-storage), non-leukocyte-reduced whole blood derived platelets (NLR-WBDP), post-storage pools of non-leukocyte-reduced whole blood derived platelets (NLR Pools) and leukocytereduced apheresis platelets in platelet additive solution (PAS). In addition, 51 frozen plasma samples accumulated over >6 years from platelet units that had been identified as false positive by users of the current PGD test were run on the new test to determine its susceptibility to such samples. Results Background/Case Studies: Blood transfusion in many parts of the world relies on serologic screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to prevent transfusion transmitted HBV infection. Sensitive HBsAg assays must be capable of coping with a wide range of mutants without compromising specificity. In addition, continued pressures on laboratory operations demand that assays perform on platforms capable of increased walk away time and enhanced automation in areas of reagent management, retest options, and commodity/waste management. To address the need for such screening assays, an improved automated assay for the detection of HBsAg has been developed. Study Design/Method: The performance of a new automated chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection and confirmation of HBsAg was evaluated on a next generation automated platform, Abbott Alinity s. Reproducibility was assessed over 5 days. Sensitivity was evaluated using 432 known positive samples, 20 commercially available seroconversion panels, the 3 rd WHO International HBsAg standard 12/226, 52 HBsAg mutants, and 16 HBsAg genotyped specimens (A through H). Specificity was evaluated on samples obtained from random blood and plasmapheresis donors. Results/Finding: Within Laboratory imprecision was less than 5% CV for positive samples over 5 days of testing. The overall specificity was 99.96% (16,985/16,991) . Sensitivity was 100% for presumed HBsAg positive samples (432/432) and all genotypes (16/16). 100% of the mutants were detected vs 79% for the licensed comparator assay. Seroconversion detection was comparable to the licensed comparator assay with 100 reactive samples detected with the Alinity s assay and 99 reactive samples detected by the comparator assay. Analytical sensitivity ranged from 0.07 to 0.08 ng/ml. The Alinity s HBsAg Confirmatory Assay confirmed all positive HBsAg specimens, including 3 HBsAg mutant samples that were not confirmed by the licensed comparator HBsAg Confirmatory Assay.",

Even so, there is still a need for good communication on the importance of proper rest and hydration before and after blood donation. Reinforcement of proper donor care from staff to donor needs to be addressed as well. Conclusion: Donors who had experienced severe reactions as a result of blood donation may have been on a rise. However, it showed no difference between the demographic variables and the number severe reaction. Nevertheless, donor safety is the quintessential factor of blood donation, and optimally targeted to minimize the rate of reaction. By recognizing these vulnerable cohorts of donors, donation staff can take extra measures to communicate pre, during and post donation advice to these groups. Staff would also be able to anticipate a reaction, hence by monitoring them closely. Background/Case Studies: Forming partnerships is an important strategy to promote blood donations and support a donor center's entire community. Donor centers should strive to engage meaningfully with the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community while also complying with federal regulation deferring males whom have had sex with males (MSM) in the last 12 months. Our university LGBTQ group approached our campus-based donor center with the idea of hosting a blood drive to highlight current MSM donor regulations and provide others the opportunity to voice their opinion to the FDA. We worked with the group to organize a blood drive while also maintaining federal regulations for blood donation. To our knowledge, there have been no published reports of a donor center supporting an LGBTQ sponsored blood drive. Herein, we describe the development of our partnership and evaluation of its merits. Study Design/Method: The collaboration was initiated by the university LGBTQ group through email communication followed by in-person meetings to plan a blood drive. Prior to drive recruitment, donor center medical staff and the LGBTQ group leadership reviewed criteria on donor eligibility and the importance of product safety. Also, diversity and sensitivity education on donor self-identification guidelines were provided for donor collection staff. The LGBTQ group used fliers and social media to publicize the drive to its members. Members subsequently pledged to donate themselves (if eligible) or recruited others to donate (if personally ineligible). The group provided regulatory material on MSM donation to its members and recruitments prior to donation. On the day of the drive, the alliance set up their own table outside the donor center, where they provided information to interested participants about MSM regulations and the opportunity to sign a petition to the FDA. Results/Finding: The partnership resulted in successful implementation of a collaborative blood drive with the LGBTQ group which was repeated for a second year. In the first LGBTQ blood drive, 31 donations were collected the first day of the drive and 30 donations the second day. The second year",

Conclusion: SQU students reported higher rates of motivating and lower rates of discouraging factors factors toward blood donation compared to non-SQU students. This reflects the influence of the increasing efforts to improve the knowledge on blood donation and recruitment among the students at SQU, through running a yearly competition between the colleges in blood donation.

Recent evidence suggests that the main risk of introducing malaria into the blood supply in most nonendemic countries are from donors who are previous residents of malaria endemic areas. These donors are considered \"semi-immune\" with low level parasitemia but are asymptomatic. Malaria antibody testing has been used in several non-endemic countries to identify these \"semi-immune\" blood donors to prevent transfusion transmitted malaria. Reported here is the detection of Malaria DNA by PCR in a Malaria antibody non-reactive donor who is a previous resident of a malaria endemic area. Study Design/Method: The donor is a 35 year old male from India who donated for the 1 st time in Singapore. He denied any history of malaria infection and informed the blood bank that his last visit to India was 9 months ago. The donor was allowed to donate and malaria antibody testing and PCR were performed in parallel to assess the malaria risk in the donor. Results/Finding: Results showed the malaria antibody test to be non-reactive but Plasmodium DNA using PCR was detected in the donor's sample. The sample was sent to the reference laboratory and Plasmodium vivax was identified. The donor's donation was discarded and was immediately contacted by a senior medical staff to inform him of the results. A new sample was collected one week after for repeat testing and showed the same results. Both donation and follow up samples were sent to another laboratory performing malaria antibody testing and showed the same non-reactive result using a different test kit. Results of the investigation are summarized in Table 1 . The donor was permanently deferred and referred to an infectious disease clinic for further evaluation and management. Conclusion: The case presented demonstrates that transfusion transmitted malaria can still occur in countries which only perform antibody testing to screen blood donors. If malaria PCR was not performed in parallel to the antibody testing, the donation from the donor would have been issued for use and may have transmitted malaria to patients requiring blood transfusion. Further studies are required to determine the incidence and significance of antibody non-reactive but PCR positive cases especially in nonendemic countries wherein a significant number of donors are previous residents of a malaria endemic area.",

Although there are currently no confirmed reports of the transmission of SARS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals, recent research data indicate that transfusiontransmitted SARS-CoV is at least theoretically possible. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system to inactivate SARS-CoV in human plasma. The THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system (Macopharma) uses methylene blue (MB) in combination with visible light for reduction of pathogen infectivity in plasma. Study Design/Method: Leukodepleted plasma was prepared from whole blood using standard blood banking technology. Plasma units (n=2) were spiked with virus suspension (10% v/v). MB/light treatment was done according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Macotronic B2 illumination device. Samples were taken after spiking (load and hold sample) and after illumination with different light doses (30, 60, 90 and 120 (standard) J/cm2)). The titer of SARS-CoV (strain Frankfurt 1) was determined as tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) by endpoint titration on Vero E6 cells (ATCC CCL-22). Results/Finding: After spiking a SARS-CoV titer of 5.43 (bag no.1) and 5.55 (bag no. 2) log10 TCID50/mL was received in the plasma units. Already with the lowest tested light dose of 30 J/cm2 MERS-CoV was inactivated down to the detection limit of the system (2.37 log10 TCID50/mL), resulting in log10 reduction factors of \u2265 3.1 (bag no. 1) and \u22653.2 (bag no. 2).

Results/Finding: From September 1, 2017 and ends on March 31, 2018, Taicang Blood Transfusion Service issued 9486.5 units of blood components, in which were 5499.5 units of red cells, 235 units of platelets, 3248.5 units of total FFP and 503.5 units of cryoprecipitate; 3774 patients were transfused with 9162 units of blood components, thus 96.58% of blood components at pilot site have been traced from donor to recipient or vice versa. There were 11 donor complications among 6489 blood donations, 4 patients suffered allergic reactions and 138 adverse incidents of transfusion chain were reported or captured. Conclusion: An exemplary HWAN that covers the entire transfusion chain have been explored and works perfectly in Taicang district. This HV cloud is China's first regional HV network, which can realize bidirectional vein-to-vein monitoring and intervention of all activities in the whole blood transfusion chain, it's meaningful to practice this HWAN in China.",

            "text": "Can Survey Responses to Online Motivational Interview Questions Enhance Blood Donation Intention? Christopher R. France* and Janis L. France. Ohio University Background/Case Studies: Motivational interviewing can be effective in enhancing blood donor retention but implementation may be costly. To address this economic challenge, we conducted two studies to examine the impact of motivational interview content on donation intention when delivered as an online survey. Study Design/Method: In study one, 3,883 respondents (52.2% female; mean age 35.69 years, SD 11.3 years) completed a donation commitment measure and were randomly assigned to one of seven motivational interview-based questions or a no-question control group. In study two, 2,246 respondents (58.4% female; mean age 35.5 years, SD 11.4 years) with a moderate level of donation commitment were randomly assigned to receive zero-to-four motivational interview-based questions. In both studies, future donation intention was measured immediately following the intervention. Results/Finding: The first study revealed a significant effect of interview question on donation intention among participants with moderate blood donation commitment, F (7,1299) = 3.699, p = 0.001, but not among those with low commitment, F (7,1233) = 1.411, p = 0.20, or high commitment, F (7,1327) = 0.964, p = 0.46. Study two replicated the significant effect of interview questions on donation intention, F(1, 2230) = 2.168, p = 0.006. Relative to the no-question control condition, follow-up analyses revealed significantly higher donation intentions with 14 of the 15 question combinations (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings provide initial support that computer-administered survey questions modelled on motivational interview content may elicit personal reflection that positively impacts donation intention, particularly among individuals with a moderate level of donation commitment.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The blood center was seeing an increase in the amount of apheresis platelet products being rejected for high platelet concentration. The increase had been occurring steadily over a period of two years. During that two year timeframe, the blood center had discontinued running pre-donation platelet counts (pre-counts) prior to or during a platelet pheresis procedure. This process had been discontinued in order to streamline the process, eliminate paper, and reduce laboratory staff interruptions. The pre-count was collected on the day of donation, was tested the following day, and an average of the previous three platelet counts was used to program the instrument for the current donation. The increase in platelet rejections caused a decrease in the amount of available products and a loss of revenue for the blood center. Study Design/Method: A team led by quality staff was developed and implemented a plan to begin obtaining day of donation pre-counts on donors. Pros and cons for both collection and lab staff were evaluated, as it significantly changed the process for both departments, and re-introduced paper records into the process. It was determined that it would be implemented for a trial period of three months and then evaluated to determine product and cost savings. Results/Finding: A significant reduction in high platelet concentration rejections was demonstrated. The blood center was rejecting approximately 4.9 products per month before this project. After implementation, the center realized a reduction to 0.8 products rejected per month. This resulted in saving the blood center approximately $2,889 per month or $34, 671 annualized. Conclusion: Implementation of obtaining day of donation donor platelet counts resulted in decreased rejections of platelet pheresis products and significant cost savings.",

Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA Background/Case Studies: Apheresis platelet (AP) collection for our hospital-based donor center was limited to our two fixed collection sites and community blood drives were limited to whole blood (WB) donations. During the planning for a community WB drive our blood center evaluated the opportunity to hold a concurrent WB and AP mobile drive. Here we discuss our hospital based-donor center's first combined WB and AP mobile drive and our steps to maximize efficiency and reduce cost in a mobile platelet drive setting. Study Design/Method: Blood donor field recruiter requested a new WB mobile drive in a desirable region of the county where there is high interest in AP donations. On the day of the request, operational staff visited the desired mobile collection site to assess the space for donor registration, donor history, segregated WB and AP collections, donor recovery, and electrical outlet location and support for our apheresis machines. Donor center leadership set up weekly meetings to examine the feasibility of hosting a concurrent WB and AP blood drive where all aspects of platelet collection requirements and mobile blood drive prerequisites were evaluated. Standard Operating Procedures were reviewed and revised to include the allowance of AP collections at mobile drives. All AP supplies and equipment were reviewed for ease of transport. The field recruiter educated and recruited 12 adults from an area high school WB drive, of which 10 were prescreened for their ability to donate multiple products, HLA test results (multiparous female donors only) and donation history/red blood cell loss. Staffing for the mobile drive included WB collections staff, 3 apheresis operators, and 2 additional operational staff to mitigate unforeseeable issues. Results/Finding: From the prescreened donors, 4 were scheduled to donate; each time slot had two back up donors. One backup donor ultimately donated. Of the 4 AP donors, 3 were first-time AP donors. Total products collected includes seven platelet units (3 double products and 1 single product) and 57 WB donations over four and six hours, respectively. The 7 platelet units resulted in a $3,010 cost savings had the units been purchased from an outside blood supplier. The platelet collections bolstered our inventory on a normally low collection day. Post-drive review with our leadership team identified the need for specialized mobile AP collection chairs. Conclusion: Our hospital-based donor center successfully held a combined WB and AP mobile drive for the first time. The time from initiation of the plan to implementation was 2 \u00bd weeks. Our approach to AP donor selection resulted in an increase of 7 AP products in a cost efficient manner.",

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: Obtaining fast and accurate test results are essential for a hospital based donor center to have blood products labeled and available for patient use. With several different automated methodologies available for testing our facility wanted to compare our current methodology of solid phase, to an automated gel system. Study Design/Method: Compare the test results and run times of three instruments. Timings include: putting samples in racks, loading samples on instrument, ordering tests, run time of tests, review of results, and unloading of samples. ABO/Rh testing included both the front and back typing, including weak Du testing when applicable. Confirmation testing was forward Background/Case Studies: A consistent blood supply to support life-saving transfusions relies on regular and repeat volunteer blood donations. In this study, we focused on donors previously deferred for low-hemoglobin (Hb) levels to better understand the value of supplying post-deferral educational information, and the actions donors took based on their deferral. Study Design/Method: An anonymous national survey of active and inactive (no donation in past 12 months) donor groups who had been deferred for low hemoglobin levels (10,000 each) was conducted. The survey questions assessed post-deferral donor actions, preferences regarding post deferral education, understanding of their deferral, and demographic information. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare categorical survey results between donor groups with p < 0.05 denoting statistical significance. Results/Finding: The survey resulted in 722 and 103 active and inactive donor responses, respectively. Active donors were more likely to recall receiving educational materials post-deferral (52% vs. 35%, p=003), take iron and vitamin supplements (54% vs. 39%, p=0.009), lived within 30 min of a donor site (94% vs. 84%, p=0.006), and more likely to be older than 45 yr (62% vs. 42%, p=0.002) than their inactive donor counterparts.

In the last 100 days of the study period, 236 of females 25 years or older changed their answer for the Q from no to yes. On the other hand, 1,217 changed their answer from yes to no. As a precaution, the blood center has systems in place that prevent collection of apheresis platelet and plasma procedures, and that prevent the release of any transfusable plasma product, from returning female donors who have previously reported being pregnant, even if they now answer no. Conclusion: We are concerned that some female donors are either confused by the new format of the question or not taking the time to read the new question. Further study could reveal more effective communication strategies related to the donor questionnaire.",

Cogent efforts are made to minimize elective surgeries during the holidays due to decreased blood donations. This study was done to analyze the differences among four regions of the United States for the month of September and December in 2017 regarding blood supply levels of seventy-four blood centers. Study Design/Method: Data was accessed from Americas Blood Centers database for the months indicated. The number of blood centers in each region were as follows: West 23, Midwest 22, South 18, and East 11. Blood supply data was categorized as 0-1 day, 1-2 days, and 3 + days. The N number of days was 21. A repeated measures analysis of variance, Dunnett's t-test, and Paired t-test was conducted using SPSS to ascertain differences among the four regions studied. For the repeated measures analysis the independent variable was region and dependent variable was days of blood supply. Results/Finding: For the month of September a Dunnett's t test (two-sided) revealed significance among all four regions (P<.05) when analyzing days of blood supply. For the month of December the Dunnett's t-test also revealed significance among the four regions (P<.05). The means for the 0-1 day blood supply by region were 1.3% (East), 7.0% (Midwest), 1.2% (South), and 0.38% (West). The means for the 1-2 day blood supply by region were 32.7% (East), 14.5% (Midwest), 7.2% (South), and 18.3% (West). The means for the 3 + day blood supply by region were 51.7% (East), 67.9% (Midwest), 55.8% (South), and 56.5% (West). The Blood Centers in the Midwest region were the most affected by short blood supply levels in December compared to the other three regions. Eighteen percent of their centers had a 0-1 day blood supply on three occasions and 11% on five occasions. Blood Centers in the West region had the highest blood supply levels reporting only 2 days of a 0-1 day supply. For Christmas day only the East region reported a 0-1 day supply of blood in 2% of blood centers; the remaining three regions all reported a 3+day blood supply. A Paired ttest (two-tailed) was performed for each blood shortage category (0-1 day, 1-2 days, 3 + days) comparing the month of December to a non-holiday month (September). Significance was found for the Midwest and South region for all three blood supply categories. The East region revealed significance for the 0-1 day category only. The West region revealed no significant differences for any of the blood supply categories. Conclusion: This study compared blood supply levels between a holiday month and non-holiday month across four regions of the United States in 2017.The Dunnett's t-test determined that the differences in region and days of blood supply were significant. The paired t-tests revealed significant differences between September and December blood supply levels for the Midwest, South, and East but not the West region. The Midwest, on average, had more blood centers with a 0-1 day of blood supply in the month of December and September than other regions studied. It is prudent to continue to track blood supply levels in Donation and transfusion services across the country and identify regions that are most vulnerable to blood shortages.",

Conclusion: Psychological care can effectively alleviate the anxiety emotion of volunteers from universities, especially non-medical major students, so that most of the adverse reactions can be preventable. During donations, different methods of nursing including conventional care and psychological care should be chosen according to the actual situation. Timely, effective and holistic psychological care deserved the promotion to alleviate the anxiety emotion and the incidence of reverse reaction of volunteers. It is necessary to establish a scientific and effective mode of promotion,education and psychological counseling for voluntary blood donation. Background/Case Studies: Timing of platelet administration can drive blood bank inventory. A stable platelet inventory ensures timely delivery of life-saving blood products but can be challenging to maintain at a tertiary care center, where there is a hospital-wide demand for both emergent and prophylactic platelet transfusions (PPTs) in active surgical and oncologic units, respectively. A high volume of overnight PPTs can lead to early morning inventory shortages that last for hours, particularly when inventory shipments occur during regular business hours, which can delay transfusions for emergent situations. In addition, overnight PPTs increase patient sleep interruptions for non-urgent reasons. Study Design/Method: A single inpatient oncology unit was found to be the highest contributor to the number of overnight (12:00-7:00 am) platelet transfusions with > 98% of these being prophylactic. Transfusion medicine and oncology physicians/nursing partnered with leaders of a patient wellness initiative to explore patient-centric reasons for delaying overnight PPTs. Analysis demonstrated that daily labs were being drawn overnight which led to PPT orders for abnormal CBC results a few hours later. A solution, postponing lab draws from 2:00 am to 5:00 am, was implemented. Statistical analysis for significance, using the chi-squared test, was performed on percentage values. Results/Finding: Postponing lab draws on the inpatient oncology unit led to a significant reduction in the proportion of overnight platelet transfusions and PPTs. There was also a decrease in the frequency of platelet inventory shortages. Conclusion: The partnership between laboratory and clinical staff identified a simple yet impactful solution to reduce overnight PPTs: postponing laboratory collection times. Changing the timing of lab draws shifted the timing of platelet administration and stabilized platelet inventory. Collaborating with clinical staff on the oncology unit as well as those leading a patient wellness initiative helped frame the project's goals in a greater patient-centered Table 1 shows the negative antigen frequencies from our donor population, most of which are comparable to the published frequencies in the general population. The exceptions are: C-(40%), S-(69%), Fy(b-) (26%), Do(a-) (39%) and Vel-(0.1%) which are higher than the published antigen frequencies. When we sort the donor population into Caucasian and African Americans, the following antigen negative frequencies were higher in the Caucasian population: C-(37%), S-(57%) and Vel-(0.1%). More importantly, our African American donors have several antigens with higher than published negative antigen frequencies including the following: C-(70%), E-(84%), V-(64%), VS-(62%), Fy(a-) (84%), Do(a-) (52%), Co(b-) (99%) and Yt(b-) (97%).

Abrupt ending of the massive transfusion protocol (MTP) and return of those products can result in temperaturerelated waste. RBCs are wasted if not maintained at refrigerated temperatures; plasma, because it is brought to 37 C for thawing, is inevitably wasted if not cooled to the required 1-6 C. We implemented the Hemoroam 15XL mobile blood storage refrigerators (MBRs) (Roemer Industries, Santee, CA) for high-volume transfusion events at our university health system, which includes 2 hospitals, a Level I trauma center, an obstetrics service and a liver transplant service (750 inpatient beds, transfusion volume: 23,000 RBC units annually). We evaluated the impact on blood product wastage. Study Design/Method: Approval and funding were obtained from the hospital administration, and 10 MBRs were purchased and validated. A new standard operating procedure (SOP) for the MBR was implemented, and our blood issuing SOP was updated. The MBRs were piloted with the liver transplant program, and usage was subsequently expanded to the entire health system, including MTPs and other highvolume transfusion events upon request. Stakeholders including the liver transplant team and operating room staff received training on using the MBRs. Usage trends and temperature-related waste of RBC and plasma units for 8 months before ( Background/Case Studies: While publications have addressed sustainability of red blood cell supply, there are sufficient differences in the dynamics of red blood cell and apheresis platelet usage to consider separate review of experience with meeting inventory demands for these products.",

            "text": "Although there are challenges to meeting Group O red blood cell inventories, overall red blood cell demands have been reduced significantly by the effects of patient blood management. For apheresis platelets, however, demand has been more sustained, reflecting the fact that indications are more often prophylactic. Since the effects, over time, of an aging red blood cell donor base on collections have been demonstrated, we decided to see if similar considerations applied to the apheresis donor base. We also decided to find out the extent to which recent restrictions on donation by women with a history of pregnancy had an effect on their participation as apheresis platelet donors. Study Design/Method: We reviewed apheresis platelet donor and apheresis platelet distribution records for 2001 through 2017. Donors were classified by age and gender. The numbers of donors in different age brackets were expressed as a percentage of the annual total number of donors for each year. We also expressed, as a percentage, the contributions that each age bracket made to the annual total apheresis platelet inventories. Results/Finding: The age bracket that included most of the apheresis platelet donors increased progressively from the 41 to 45 years bracket in 2001, to 51 to 55 years in 2009, and to 56 to 60 years in 2017. In 2001, 14.3% of apheresis platelet donors were 56 years of age or older. In 2009 and 2017, these percentages rose to 26.4% and 33.6%, respectively. While there was an increasing reliance (see Table) on older donors, percent contributions to annual inventories from 31 to 50 year old donors decreased by more than half between 2001 and 2017. When 2016 and 2017, the first full year of restrictions on female donors with a history of pregnancy were compared, male donor apheresis platelet contributions to annual inventory increased by 6.9% and female contributions decreased by 22%. Conclusion: Significant aging of the apheresis donor base is such that reliance on older donors will be thwarted when, in the near future, they are more likely to be patients than they are likely to continue as apheresis donors. Restrictions on female donors have had significant effects on their participation as apheresis donors. To ensure sustainability in apheresis platelet inventories, programs will have to understand why donors aged between 31 and 50, who were dominant contributors previously, are now relatively inaccessible as donors.",

In any case, shipper validation requires measuring the temperature of the payload over a required period of time while exposing the fully packed shipper to different ambient profiles. However, the placement of temperature probes is not standardized and therefore varies across blood centers. This study aims to understand and demonstrate the effects of payload volume, temperature probe placement, on shipper validation. Study Design/Method: A series of experiments were performed, for a cardboard/Styrofoam shipper packed with 10 to 20 lbs. of wet ice. Representative volume and dimensions of water bags were used as substitute for RBC units. Number of payload units was varied to determine the effect of payload volume on measured payload temperature. Payload units were placed vertically inside a payload holder. A bag of wet ice was placed on top of the payload holder inside the shipper. NIST calibrated temperature-measuring devices were used to record temperature every 2 minutes, at different locations inside the shipper. The shipper was placed inside a programmable environmental chamber, and exposed to transient temperature profiles representative of summer and winter conditions for 24 hours to simulate ambient temperatures during transit. Temperature of the payload at different locations of the shipper as a function of time was recorded for each of the configurations. Numerical thermal simulations using finite volume method (FVM) software were also performed to visualize temperature distributions, in key configurations. For comparison, an insulated shipper specifically designed with phase change materials was tested under similar ambient conditions. Results/Finding: The temperature recorded for the cardboard/Styrofoam shipper tested with wet ice showed a variation of 5C and 3C between payloads at different locations inside the shipper during summer and winter ambient tests, respectively. The test results are presented in Table 1 . This identifies the importance of temperature probe placement during shipper validation.",

            "text": "Applying Background/Case Studies: In developing nations and remote areas, the transportation of blood was often inconvenient owing to poor infrastructure and geographical barrier. Once issued, the blood units cannot be taken back by blood bank with the concern of short shelf life and cold chain. Thus, there is a dilemma of blood storage in hospitals in remote areas: if the blood storage is too little, there will be a blood supply shortage; if the blood storage is too much, there will be a much higher blood expiration and waste. As the result, it causes a bottleneck of blood supply and decreases blood availability. To promote blood supply management efficiency and ensure blood availability in remote areas, an Internet of Things (IoT) -based blood cold chain monitoring system was developed. Study Design/Method: RFID cards were attached to red blood cells unit bags to monitor cold chain. Red blood cells units stored in remote hospitals that are due to expire in 15 days are taken back and redistributed to nearby hospitals after necessary tests. The study collected the data before and after using the new monitoring system in four island hospitals during 2009 to 2016, and analyzed the data of blood expiration with statistical methods. Results/Finding: Since the new monitoring system was deployed in 2013 among four hospitals in remote islands (inhabitants more than 70,000), the red blood cells unit storage has increased. The incident of emergency blood collection and supply was decreased from eight (year 2009-2012, prior to the use of new monitoring system) to one (year 2013-2016, since the use of new monitoring system), thus blood availability was increased significantly. Also with the comparison of the same time span, the number of expired red blood cells units was decreased from 1819 to 430, and the expiry rate declined from 27% to 6%. The difference of expiry rates in each hospital between before and after the use of new monitoring system is significant (P<0.05). There has been no adverse report of the reuse of the take-back blood units.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Blood inventory management is a tricky and challenging process, considering the absence of real constraints to control blood issuing upon its need. Therefore, maintaining the balance between guaranteeing blood availability and minimizing wastage is a continuous demand to make sure that the product is used effectively and efficiently. At King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) blood bank, over 12,000 blood units are donated each year to cover KHCC patient demands. Minimum stock limits for each blood type govern the amount of donations accepted on daily basis, in accordance with Jordanian ABO distribution figures. Daily total minimum stock limit is established based on the current patient need and is reviewed at least annually (189 blood unit in 2015, and was adjusted twice since: 210 in 2016 and 252 in 2017) based on increased demand. The aim of this study, is to examine KHCC inventory management performance in order to consider appropriate guidelines for best practice and to improve efficiency of blood bank services. For unused FFP we identified 26 providers: 23 with one (1) unused unit, one with two (2) unused units, one with three (3) unused units, and one with seven (7) unused units. Five (5) patients expired before transfusion, and three (3) FFP bags broke. For unused platelets there were sixteen providers, fourteen with one (1) unused unit each, one provider with two (2) unused units, and one provider with three (3) unused units. Blood Bank technologist(s) were involved with three (3) additional unused platelet units. Conclusion: There was a significant reduction in RBC discards in 2017 compared to the two prior years, due to a new real time on-line blood product ordering system real time on-line blood product ordering system with the blood supplier; and a lesser, sustained reduction in Platelet wastage in 2016. For FFP and platelets, the major reasons for discard were that the units were ordered and not used. Background/Case Studies: Although blood programs have a number of different approaches to providing apheresis platelet inventories at hospitals, including prohibiting returns, our large blood center elects to rotate and restock apheresis platelets maintained on site at approximately 30 healthcare facilities. While there is no charge for this service, it relies on many hospitals, which typically experience a relatively high daily transfusion demand for apheresis platelets, accepting shorter dated units that have been returned to the blood center through the daily rotation schedule. Recently, however, there has been an increasing number of requests from facilities to keep onsite inventories of apheresis platelets. This is to comply with anticipated maternal levels of care designation requirements, massive transfusion protocols, and trauma level designations. Against the background of continuing challenges to maintaining adequate inventories at hospitals, made more acute by increasing demand for product and aging of the apheresis platelet donor base, we decided to investigate our rotate and restock policy more closely. We wanted to pay special attention to the proportion of our overall apheresis platelet supply under rotate and restock management and also the proportion of this inventory eventually lost to outdate when short dated product, returned from rotation and restocking hospitals, was not transfused at busier transfusion services. Study Design/Method: We reviewed our annual apheresis platelet supply to rotation and non-rotation hospitals for 2015 through 2017 and selected for special attention those rotation hospitals returning more than 50% of their apheresis platelet stocks. A daily average was determined for the number of hours before outdate remaining on apheresis platelets at issue and at return. Further evaluation was carried out on the returned platelets for their eventual percentage outdate. Results/Finding: During 2015 through 2017, 131,882 apheresis platelets were distributed to all hospitals. Of this distribution 75,193 (57%) were provided to the rotation restock hospitals. Of the 30 hospitals on this platelet rotation restock program, 18 utilized less than 50% of the platelets shipped to them from 2015 to 2017. There was an average of 76 hours remaining on the platelets shipped and 44 hours remaining before outdate when these platelets were returned. The total number of platelets distributed to the 18 hospitals was 45,882, of which 18,332 (40%) were used. Of the remaining 27,550 returned, 4,794 (17.4%) were ultimately outdated.",

Studies have shown that the production of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies in iTTP is linked to specific HLA class II susceptibility (DRB1*11, DQB1*02, DQB1*03) and protective (DRB1*04, DR53) alleles. The current study aims to identify if iTTP patients from Lebanon display similar risk and/or protective alleles as those described in the literature. Study Design/Method: HLA-DRB and HLA-DQB loci were studied at the genetic level in two representative samples consisting of 18 Lebanese patients with iTTP on the one hand and 30 Lebanese healthy controls on the other hand. After extraction, DNA was amplified using HLA-DRB and HLA-DQB PCR-Sequence Specific Primers and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis",

HLA-DQB1*03 was found in 12 patients vs. 26 controls with a p-value of 1.000. Conclusion: In the Lebanese population, HLA-DR53 appears to be a protective factor against the development of iTTP and HLA-DQB1*02 appears to be a risk factor for developing the disease. This result is consistent with previous studies reported in the literature and that were conducted on other populations.

Hospital Sirio Libanes Blood Bank Background/Case Studies: HTLV-1/2 infection is endemic in our country and testing blood donors for these viruses is mandatory since 1993. From the initial detection and isolation of HTLV-1, HTLV research has been expanded and led to the development of more sensitive and specific methods of anti-HTLV-1/2 antibody detection. Our legislation requires HTLV antibody detection and recommends supplemental assays (like Western blot -WB) in reactive cases. In our experience, there is one HTLV-1/2 indeterminate (ind) WB out of six HTLV reactive screened donations",

Among the 103 individuals, 54 were typed as M+N\u2212 and 49 were M+N+, while none of these individuals was S+s+. Five individuals were S+s\u2212 and other 98 individuals were S\u2212s+, however, both of the S and s antigen densities of their RBCs were almost half as compared with the control S+s\u2212 RBCs and S\u2212s + RBCs, respectively, by flow cytometric analysis. Among the 103 individuals, no expression of low incidence antigens such as Miltenberger and St a was observed. Cloning and sequence analysis using cDNA revealed that an individual with PRM comprised exon A2 or E2 with M specific sequence fused to exon B5-B6. Long-range PCR amplified a large fragment of GYPB from gDNA showed that E2, E3 and E4 replace B2, B3 and B4 in the GYP (B-E-B) hybrid allele. E-B junction occurred 795 to 1247 bp upstream of exon B5. Conclusion: PRM is predicted to be encoded by a GYP(B-E-B) hybrid gene. The primary structure of the polypeptide encoded by this hybrid gene comprise amino acids residues 20-45 (1-26) of GPE fused to residues 46-78 (27-59) of GPB. This polypeptide expresses M antigen but not S/s antigens.IGT25Development of a Next GenerationSequencing Based ABO Blood Group Assay and Typing Software Abigail Joseph* 1 , Helen H.

We propose the term En(IND) (for India) for this novel variant. Conclusion: The En(IND) insertional GYPA variant is the first new genetic basis for the En(a-) phenotype in 30 years and is undetected by the commonly used M/N-locus probes.

Taken together, the family investigation confirms c.\u221272G>A to occur on the B allele. Conclusion: We found a previously unreported mutation, c.\u221272G>A, which is located in the same area of the ABO promoter as three previously described substitutions: c.\u221268G>T and c.\u221277C>G giving rise to the B 3 phenotype as well as c.\u221276G>C resulting in the A 3 phenotype. Both Takahashi et al. (Vox Sanguinis, 2014) and Isa et al. (Vox Sanguinis, 2015) have confirmed by luciferase assays that the c.\u221268G>T/c.\u221277C>G/c.\u221276G>C mutations reduce promoter activity in vitro. Thus, it is not unlikely that c.\u221272G>A acts via a similar mechanism to cause downregulation of B transcripts and thereby decreased expression of B antigen on RBCs. In fact, the \u221272G>A mutation is positioned close to a KLF7 site and in the absence of other deviations from the consensus B sequence, is proposed to explain the B 3 -like phenotype in this family.

Preliminary results from this study shows the potential for transfusion-associated microchimerism in chronically transfused pediatric patient populations. If confirmed, this would be the first reported finding of this transfusion associated consequence within this patient population. This would also indicate that leukodepletion/irradiation of RBC units does not eliminate the risk of this transfusion-related outcome. Australian governments fund the Australian Red Cross Blood Service to provide blood, blood products and services to the Australian community. SDPs were FDA approved with no age restrictions. Due to inventory limitations from our blood supplier during the conversion period, a dual inventory of CONV and PR platelets was, of necessity, maintained. This offered an opportunity to analyze, over a 14-month period, PR versus CONV platelets regarding platelet usage patterns and the incidence of transfusion reactions in patients 0-18 years. Study Design/Method: From December 2016 to January 2018, a dual platelet inventory was maintained. CONV platelets, analyzed with a bacterial detection assay as a safety measure, and PR platelets were both used as the standard of care. When platelets were requested, either product was issued per blood bank inventory management policy. We reviewed transfusions from this period to assess platelet usage patterns and transfusion reactions to CONV or PR platelet products in our pediatric patient population. Transfusions reactions were ascribed to the appropriate platelet product based on proximity to the transfusion and categorized per National Hemovigilance Network Guidelines. Statistics were mean\u00b11 SD, significance was p<0.05. Results/Finding: Patients from 0-18 years received a total of 1,334 transfusions over this time period. There were 725 CONV platelet and 609 PR platelet transfusions administered to 180 unique patients. There were 99 patients who received only one type of platelet (CONV or PR). The other 81 patients received both types of platelets and were only included in the analysis of transfusion reactions. Of patients who received only CONV 49% of transfusions). No cases of TRALI, septic reactions, or other transfusion transmitted infections were reported in either group. For patients under 4 months who received ultraviolet blue light phototherapy and PR platelets, no reactions attributable to the PR transfusions were reported. Conclusion: PR products are similar to CONV platelets in regard to platelet utilization patterns and the number of transfusion episodes per patient. The use of PR platelets in our pediatric patients also appears to be safe, with similar numbers of transfusion reactions compared to CONV platelets. glucose and mannitol; absence of sodium chloride; pH=8.5) has optimized the quality of RBCs during storage. The key is maintaining the internal pH>7.2, so that the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase remains able to synthesize 2,3-DPG without decreasing ATP. This can be achieved by a high external pH, and also by the absence of chloride in the RAS. Addition of the RAS leads to chloride moving out of the RBC, and to maintain the electrolytic balance, hydrogen enters the cell, thus increasing the internal pH (\"chloride shift\"). Extra bicarbonate in the RAS can serve as additional buffer, preventing the drop in internal pH. Further, guanosine is known to shift RBC metabolism towards the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in synthesis of NADHP, which can be used to synthesize 2,3-DPG and ATP. The aim was to study the effect of addition of extra bicarbonate and guanosine to Sol-X RAS on the in vitro quality of stored RBC concentrates. Study Design/Method: One leukoreduced packed RBC concentrate was split in 4 equal parts. To each part, 24 mL of Sol-X was added: part A, standard composition (with 26 mM bicarbonate); part B, extra 26 mM bicarbonate (52 mM total), part C, with 1.4 mM guanosine, and part D, with extra 26 mM bicarbonate (52 mM total) and 1.4 mM guanosine. The concentrates were stored for 56 days with weekly sampling to determine various in vitro quality parameters (n=3 replicate experiments).Results/Finding: The results are shown in theTable.The addition of bicarbonate led to an increased external and internal pH, due to the chloride shift. However, this did not have an effect on 2,3-DPG levels, and had a minor effect on ATP content. The presence of guanosine in addition to",

In a recent study we demonstrated that PLT storage performance was consistent by donor. A main difference between 'good' and 'poor' storage properties involved metabolic activity, resulting in a faster decline of pH during storage of 'poor' PLT concentrates (PC). This might be caused by mitochondrial defects which have been associated with age and age-related diseases like metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that PLTs obtained from young whole blood (WB) donors have better storage properties than PLTs from aged donors. The young group had only one outlier (pH=6.37), whereas the aged group contained 5 sPCs with a pH <6.3, not being outliers and including the two donors with high HbA1c. Also other in vitro variables reflected better in vitro quality of the young group than the aged group. However, no differences in mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured with JC-1, were detected. Conclusion: PCs prepared from buffy coat, obtained from young WB donors showed better storage performance than those from aged donors. Levels of ibuprofen in PC were <10 mg/L.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the relation of perioperative RBCT with cancer recurrence in patients undergoing surgical tumor debulking due to primary ovarian cancer. In PSM adjusted analysis, confounders were well balanced and RBCT did no longer increase risk of cancer recurrence or death. Findings of the meta-analysis of 3 trials, including data from this study, confirmed that perioperative RBCT did not affect disease-free survival after ovarian cancer surgery. Conclusion: Worse oncological outcomes in patients without macroscopic tumor residuals after surgery for ovarian cancer who received perioperative RBCT are caused by the clinical circumstances requiring transfusions, not due to the blood transfusions themselves. Concerns about oncological outcomes should not be an issue in the decision-making process for perioperative RBCT.",

In addition to the established clinical value of RBC genotyping in many clinical scenarios, NGS has the potential to query every known blood group variant and to identify novel variants in patients and donors. Processing and interpretation of NGS output files requires considerable computational resources and informatics expertise. To facilitate application of this technology by the transfusion research community, we present an opensource software designed to predict an extended RBC phenotype from NGS, illustrate its function through the analysis of exome sequencing (ES) data from 1018 participants of the ClinSeq\u00ae sequencing cohort, and validate its predictions by serology. Study Design/Method: RyLAN (Red Cell and Lymphocyte Antigen prediction from NGS) is as an open-source Python application that takes an NGS sorted binary alignment matrix (.bam) file and index as input. The software interacts with a non-relational database that encodes genomic coordinates and phenotype interpretation rules and yields a predicted RBC phenotype with associated quality parameters. Multiple hard filters can be modified per individual coordinate. The output is provided as a MongoDB document to facilitate complex bulk queries and statistical analysis. We employed RyLAN to analyze 1018 ES NGS files from the ClinSeq\u00ae cohort using a database of 368 known blood group variants and validated phenotype predictions with CLIA-certified serologic assays.

Although smokers have higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels, smoking may affect the quality of donated RBCs.

Study Design/Method: RBC segments from 100 unique donors were tested for cotinine using a mass spectrometry assay and COHb with the GEM Pre-Thirteen percent of RBC units tested positive for cotinine at levels consistent with active smoking, accordant with the estimated CDC national smoking rate of 15.1%. Our preliminary data show that smoker RBC units had greater COHb content and reduced hematocrit increments following transfusion. However, these results must be validated in a larger sample size of smoker RBC units with careful attention to potential confounding variables, including age, gender and underlying disease of recipients.

Results/Finding: ng/ml in females and <30 ng/ml in males) was estimated for 16, 17, 18 yo donors. Operational databases provided demographic and donation activity in the prior 24 months. Modified Poisson regression assessed AIS and LF risk by demographic and donation factors. Results/Finding: >117,000 donations from 16-18 yo donors were tested for ferritin between 1/29 and 3/29/18. The prevalence of LF was 34% overall, 22% in males and 45% in females vs AIS of 13% overall, 3.2% in males and 22% in females. LF was less prevalent in 16 vs 18 yo in unadjusted analysis, but the difference disappeared after adjustment in regression analysis. Risk for LF showed the expected gradient in risk for increasing donation frequency (not shown), a higher risk for females (Risk Ratio, RR=2.0), but only modest differences over time since last donation (seeTable). In AIS regression models, stratified by sex, differences emerged compared to the models for LF: in males, but not females, both 16-and 17-yo had risk for AIS statistically distinguishable from 18 yo donors (RR = 1.36 and 1.15, respectively). Also, the impact of interval since last donation was an important predictor, with AIS risk duration to 39 weeks following donation controlling for other covariates.Conclusion: The prevalence of LF and AIS in 16-18 yo donors varies by age, sex, and donation frequency, as in adult donors. This analysis indicates, for the first time, a higher AIS risk in 16 yo male donors compared to 18 yo. The importance of interval since donation as a strong predictor for AIS but not LF suggests that AIS may be a more relevant indicator of physiological response to the stress of donation. Analysis of on-going longitudinal data will be useful to assess the impact of ferritin testing, optimal cutoffs for donor management, and appropriate deferral lengths.Background/Case Studies: Donors need education and time to make an informed decision to proceed or decline whole blood donation.

NEM include current education topics such as iron replacement, not found in CEM. This study was IRB approved as an exempt protocol. ND with CEM, Group 3 RD with NEM, and Group 4 RD with CEM. Participants completed a previously validated pre-and post-quiz about blood donation. Each quiz had the same ten multiple-choice questions using single best answers including the answer option, \"I don't know.\" For example, \"You need photo identification to donate blood.\" Answer options: True, False or I don't know.Results/Finding: Demographics and quiz results are shown in table 1. Groups 1 and 3 showed greater knowledge acquisition using the NEM versus Groups 2 and 4 using the CEM. Groups 1 and 3 also showed a greater reduction in, \"I don't know,\" responses and in incorrect responses.

If platelet antibody screening or crossmatch testing is needed in patients receiving anti-CD38 or anti-CD47 therapy, positive platelet antibody detection tests in these patients should be interpreted with caution.Background/Case Studies: Rh antibodies are common despite serologic Rh-matched transfusions for patients with sickle cell disease. Rh specificities can be complex and result from absence of high prevalence Rh antigens or altered Rh epitopes due to RH gene variation. Antibody identification can be complicated by lack of reagent red cells expressing uncommon Rh phenotypes. We hypothesized that human induced pluripotent stem cells could be reprogrammed from rare donors or genetically engineered to produce red cells (iRBCs) in culture as reagents to aid complex antibody identification. We aimed to generate iRBCs for use in blood bank assays. Study Design/Method: We generated customized iPSCs that included 1) Rh null cells, 2) cells lacking the high prevalence Rh antigen hrS, or 3) hrB. For the Rh null line, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering in a WT iPSC line to disrupt the RH alleles by a large deletion and/or via frameshift mutations resulting in an early stop codon. For lines lacking high prevalence Rh antigens, we reprogrammed group O donor cells whose RH genotypes confirmed the absence of hrS or hrB antigens, respectively. Two independent clones from each customized line were characterized for pluripotency and a normal karyotype confirmed. Results/Finding: We differentiated customized iPSCs by an embryoid body protocol with combinations of hematopoietic cytokines. We harvested hematopoietic progenitors on day 8 and cultured these cells with erythroid specific cytokines. We demonstrate progressive maturation to Band 3 high, alpha integrin low iRBCs that became smaller in size and had condensed nuclei. Rh expression by flow cytometry was comparable for D + iRBCs compared to donor-derived D + red cells, while Rh null iRBCs showed complete absence of cell surface Rh. We assessed RBC agglutination by gel card assay of cultured untargeted and Rh null iRBCs using standard Rh typing reagents. The untargeted iRBCs agglutinated as expected with anti-Rh reagents while the Rh-null iRBCs showed no agglutination with all 5 common Rh antibodies (DCcEe). In testing with patient serum containing anti-e, untargeted cultured iRBCs agglutinated and Rh null iRBCs showed no agglutination. Similarly, in testing with patient serum containing anti-hrS, hrS + iRBCs agglutinated and hrS-iRBCs showed no agglutination. Conclusion: Customized iPSCs can be reprogrammed from rare donors or genetically engineered to express rare blood group antigen phenotypes or antigen combinations that are difficult or impossible to find from donors. iRBCs produced from customized iPSCs can be used as blood bank reagents and potentially standardize antibody identification in patients with complex specificities. When scale-up technology is available, Rh null iRBCs could be used as universal donor cells for therapeutic application. Patients with a suspected diagnosis of primary ITP were included once they met pre-defined clinical inclusion criteria. The presence of GP IIb/IIIa-, GP Ib/IX, and GP V-specific aabs was investigated by monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens (MAIPA) assay, both on patients' autologous platelets (direct MAIPA) and in serum (indirect MAIPA). Serum IgG fractions were tested by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology for the presence of anti-GP V aabs. Clearance of human platelets from the circulation in the presence of anti-GP V aabs was studied in a NOD/SCID mouse model. Anti-GP V is often detected on platelets from ITP patients. Our study has important implications for both, further development of laboratory testing, and guidance for clinical decision making. Comparison between MAIPA and SPR reveals that free aabs may be more frequent than reported, since aabs appear to escape detection by standard laboratory methods because of low affinity. Anti-GP V by itself induces platelet clearance. Predicting disease severity and/or tailoring ITP therapy should not be restricted to the previously postulated difference between anti-GP IIb/IIIa and anti-GP Ib/IX, and further prospective studies are required to understand the impact of different platelet aabs on the clinical course of ITP.Background/Case Studies: Variant RHCE alleles encoding weak or partial antigen expression can result in false negative typing by licensed serologic testing. We investigated 16 donor RBC samples with variant C, E or e antigen expression that were found as discrepancies between PK7300 (Beckman Coulter) and HEA PreciseType, and were then fully RH genotyped. Our aim was to see if these variant/partial antigens would be detected in the crossmatch when tested with immune plasmas containing the corresponding antibody specificity. Study Design/Method: Compatibility testing was done by LISS, PEG IAT and Gel with appropriate controls.Conclusion: While the PK7300 is FDA licensed for labeling of donor units, some RHCE variants (RHCE*CeVA, *cEEW, *cE type IV, *ceMO, *CeRN and *cE697G) are not detected as antigen positive and donor units are labeled as antigen negative. An IAT crossmatch must be performed for patients with atypical antibodies, however, IAT crossmatch testing of these variant RHCE genotype RBCs with a battery of immune anti-C, -E or -e gave variable results. Most were missed when using LISS enhancement. PEG was consistently more likely to detect the reduced antigen expression. The clinical significance of transfusing weak partial Rh antigen positive RBCs to a patient with the corresponding antibody has not been reported, but should be considered if compromised survival of transfused RBCs is noted.Study Design/Method: ALTRUYST (NCT02655055) was a randomized, longitudinal, controlled clinical trial designed to determine if repeated exposure to citrate through apheresis donation reduces BMD. Male donors, 18-65 years of age with no more than five previous apheresis donations and no diseases of bone or mineral metabolism, agreed to make \u226520 apheresis donations in the subsequent one year period. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed at baseline, before randomization into a high frequency apheresis or no apheresis arm, and again after one year of participation. Paired t-test was used to assess change in mean BMD.Background/Case Studies: Anti-A and anti-B antibodies pose a risk of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions in recipients with the corresponding antigen. Debate continues on the titer of anti-A and B and which antibody class, IgM or IgG, to test to ensure optimal safety. The US military uses a single titer cutoff of <1:256 of IgM anti-A and B as safe in non-group O recipients. With the resurgence of whole blood use in civilian traumas, it is important to determine the prevalence of these antibodies in the current donor population. Study Design/Method: O Rh(D) positive male fixed site donors with a history of 2 or more donations were selected for testing study. This mitigated for transfusion related acute lung injury while allowing for a robust, committed donor pool. IgM Anti-A and Anti-B (IgM anti-A/B) antibodies were deter-Donor age ranged from 16 to 84 years. The table below shows the data stratified by donor age. Using Fisher Exact, the prevalence of IgM anti-A/B antibodies was statistically lower in males aged 50 and over. Conclusion: In this population of male O Rh(D) positive donors, 18.25% had anti-A and/or anti-B IgM titer levels of 1:256 or greater. The prevalence of antibody declined with age, reaching statistical significance in males over 50.

Services least frequently ordering plasma deemed NI were Emergency Medicine (NI=10/104, 10%) and General Surgery (NI=13/100, 13%). Conclusion: At our institution, plasma is frequently ordered for non-indicated reasons, exposing patients to unnecessary transfusion-associated risks. No clear trends in NI orders were noted among trainees of differing academic years, suggesting medical service culture may affect order entry more than level of academic training. Our data identified the services that most commonly order non-indicated products, illustrating an area that could be targeted for focused education and improvement.PBM21 Anemia Diagnosis and Management Utilizing a Reflexive Algorithmic Laboratory Panel Christine Cahill* 1 , Amy E.

Sweeney 2 . 1 Rhode Island Hospital,Lifespan Academic Medical CenterBackground/Case Studies: It is problematic to compare blood usage between institutions of various sizes and complexity. A large tertiary care hospital will use more blood components than a small community hospital, but this does not mean that the usage at either hospital is appropriate or otherwise. There are three hospitals in our hospital system: Hospital A, a tertiary care teaching hospital licensed for 719 beds, Hospital B, a 247-bed teaching hospital, and Hospital C, a small community non-teaching hospital with 129 beds. Since the absolute number of red cells transfused per hospital differ substantially and likely related to patient volume and acuity, adjusting the red cell usage for both variables could allow for a more valid comparison of usage. Study Design/Method: Data were collected for a five-year period, 2013 through 2017 for all three hospitals. Included were: total red cell usage, number of discharges, and the mean case mix index (CMI). The CMI is a value representing the clinical complexity and case diversity of patients. In general, the CMI varies from 0.5 to 18 per discharge; patients with more complex medical problems, complications, or surgery have higher CMIs. Thus CMI was used in this calculation as a surrogate for acuity. A higher CMI, should correlate with greater blood usage. The comparison was performed first by calculating usage of red cells per 1000 discharges to correct for patient volume. A second calculation divided the usage per 1000 discharges by the CMI, to correct for patient acuity.Results/Finding:Results are shown in the table. The first three rows show data for gross usage, discharges, and CMI. The fourth row adjusts for patient volume, and the final row adjusts for volume and acuity. Using this calculation, it is clear that Hospital C, the small community hospital, has higher adjusted rates of transfusion and should be targeted for educational intervention. Conclusion: Blood management focused on red blood cell usage per discharge as a metric for appropriate usage does not take into account the complexity of the cases. Our proposed calculation may give greater insight into appropriate usage and identify hospitals which would benefit from interventions to change transfusion practice.",

Bolger 3 and Frank Caruso 2 . 1 Parkway Pathology Group, 2 Missouri Baptist Medical Center Laboratory, 3 Missouri Baptist Medical Center Background/Case Studies: It is estimated that approximately 11.3 million red blood cells (RBCs) were transfused in the United States in 2015.Although transfusions have decreased in recent years, they are still considered one of the five most overused procedures in hospitals. Blood transfusions can be harmful, and have been shown to increase the risk of hospital acquired bacterial infections and length of hospital stay, as well as exposing the patient to transfusion reactions or alloimmunization. In addition, the cost of blood components is one of the greatest hospital expenses after personnel. It is estimated that a large percentage (up to 40% by some estimates) of blood transfusions are performed without a valid clinical indication and/or potential for clinical benefit.Patient Blood Management programs aim to reduce unnecessary transfusions. Study Design/Method: A hospital-wide initiative was launched in 2008 with a goal to decrease blood utilization at Missouri Baptist Medical Center (MBMC), a 489-bed community hospital in St. Louis. A Blood Utilization committee was formed in November, 2008, comprising Laboratory and Blood Bank personnel, as well as the Chief Medical Officer (CMO). The CMO personally invited Clinical Champions from Oncology, Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Critical Care. Transfusion triggers were established by the transfusion service. Educational outreach programs were presented by physicians to all departments and Chiefs and at quarterly staff meetings. Grand Rounds was presented by the Clinical Champion for Oncology and video was made available on the hospital intranet site to all employees. A Tableau dashboard was created to track transfusions according to hemoglobin values, patient care area, and physicians. Implementation of clinical decision support tools is ongoing as the hospital system transitions to an EPIC electronic medical record in phases during 2017-2018. Results/Finding: From 2008-2013, MBMC reduced RBC transfusion from 9,691 to 4,640 units, a 52% reduction. Reducing transfusion improved patient safety by reducing the risk of transfusion reactions to a similar degree. Blood transfusion rates have remained flat since 2014, despite an increase in case mix index (CMI) from 1.56 in 2008 to 1.76 in 2017. Transfusions per CMI adjusted discharges decreased from 0.2721 in 2008 to 0.1370 in 2017. Blood costs decreased from $2,766,724 in 2008 to $1,591,459 in 2014, a reduction of 42.5%. Since its inception, the blood utilization program has saved $7 million in blood component expenses. Conclusion: A robust PBM program can reduce transfusion rates, reduce adverse events, and save money in a community hospital setting. Sustained reductions are possible with physician engagement, prospective review of transfusion requests, real-time transfusion data, and employment of clinical decision support tools.

Turgeon 5 and Ryan Zarychanski* 1 . 1 University of Manitoba / Cancer-Care Manitoba, 2 University of Manitoba, 3 The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute / University of Ottawa, 4 The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,Background/Case Studies: Perioperative bleeding is a major indication for allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In the era of widespread blood conservation initiatives, transfusion rates in major non-cardiac surgeries are poorly quantified, outdated and do not reflect interval efforts to minimize perioperative transfusion. A current assessment of transfusion patterns in high-risk non-cardiac surgeries is needed. The objective of this study is to describe contemporary transfusion practices in patients undergoing major high-risk non-cardiac surgery. Study Design/Method: We completed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate all patients ( \u2265 18 years of age) undergoing non-cardiac surgery at five hospitals in two cities between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016.We used standardized Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) procedure codes contained within the hospital Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). We linked the DAD with transfusion databases and laboratory databases to obtain supplementary transfusion and laboratory data. We excluded uncommon ( < 15 procedures) and low-risk ( < 5% transfusion rate) procedures. For the remaining procedures, we characterized the proportion of patients transfused, the mean number of RBC units transfused, and the number of RBC units transfused annually. Results/Finding: In 5 centres, we identified 74,906 patient admissions with a surgical procedure in the main operating room. We identified 95 open non-cardiac surgeries associated with a transfusion rate \u22655%. In these procedures, the baseline transfusion rate was 16%, and ranged from 5% to 49%. 37% received 1 RBC unit, 32% received 2 RBC units, and 11% were transfused \u2265 5 units. Of those transfused, the mean number of RBCs transfused was 2.8 units( \u00b1 1.1 units). The ten procedures with the highest trans-In the era of blood conservation, we have described the transfusion practices in major non-cardiac procedures at high risk for transfusion. This has implications for patient consent, pre-operative planning and blood bank utilization.PBM27Risk-Adjusted Blood Utilization Across All Inpatient Hospital Stays Ryan A. Metcalf* 1 , Sandra K. White 1 , Scott Potter 1 , Reed Barney 2 , Michael White 2 , Cheri Hunter 2 and Robert Blaylock 1 . 1 University of Utah and ARUP, 2 University of Utah Background/Case Studies: Blood transfusion is a high-volume activity that is often overused and risk-adjusted benchmarking may be useful. The aim of this study was to define risk-adjusted blood use across the entirety of all inpatient hospital stays using diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Study Design/Method: All adult inpatient hospital stays from 5/2014-3/2018 at a large academic center were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Blood usage, Medicare Severity (MS)-DRGs, All Patient Related (APR)-DRGs, and other variables were captured over entire hospital stays. Results/Finding: 97955 hospital stays were evaluated(Table 1). Burn, cardiac surgery, trauma, and surgical ICU showed the highest correlation between RBC use and DRG weights (Spearman Rho ranges 0.5-0.6). Hematology, cardiothoracic surgery, gastroenterology, and transplant surgery showed the highest correlation between platelet use and DRG weights (Spearman Rho ranges 0.39-0.54). All p-values for RBCs and platelets were <0.003 except for a couple services performing very few transfusions. Conclusion: Blood use for services with the greatest number of blood components per hospital stay correlated most strongly with DRG numerical weights across entire inpatient hospital stays.

Infusion reactions, malignancies, and autoimmunity (e.g., Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)) may occur. To date, TTP has not been reported in pts during or after treatment with ALE. Here we report a pt with ALE-associated ITP who subsequently developed autoimmune thyroid storm and TTP. Study Design/Method: Case Report. 31 year old male with MS (diagnosed 3 years prior to admission (PTA)) received ALE (last dose 16 months PTA) and developed ALE-associated ITP during post-treatment surveillance 4 months PTA. Five days PTA due to dark urine and a platelet count of 5,000/mm^3, he was referred to a local hospital for evaluation. At admission a diagnosis of ITP exacerbation was made. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and prednisolone. His hematuria continued and due to severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hgb) = 6.5 g/dL), he received multiple RBC transfusions. Due to his worsening status and refractoriness to hemotherapy, further studies were performed showing platelets=6000/mm^3, creatinine=1.3 mg/dL, total bilirubin=3.9 mg/Dl, and LDH > 2000u/L. Peripheral blood smear inspection showed schistocytes/spherocytes. He was emergently transferred to our hospital for therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for presumed TTP. Results/Finding: Upon admission laboratory studies revealed Hgb=6.1 g/dL; platelet count = 11,000 /mm^3. Studies for ADAMTS13 activity/ADAMTS13 inhibitor levels were collected and subsequently measured, confirming TTP (<5%; 1.2 BU, respectively). Despite multiple RBC/FFP transfusions prior to TPE initiation, he experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure and was admitted to the critical care unit. Additional testing (TSH < 0.02 mIU/mL, free T4 = 3.09 ng/dL, and sodium=148 mmol/) supported a further diagnosis of thyroid storm (autoimmune etiology based on subsequent studies). TPE (1.0 plasma volume) using FFP replacement was begun. He underwent a total of 21 TPE procedures, and a 4 dose cycle of Rituximab with normalization of platelets, Hgb and LDH levels. His mental status/neurological functioning returned to baseline post stabilization of T4 and sodium levels.Conclusion: ALE may cause severe life threatening autoimmune disorders. Although ITP has been reported as the major autoimmune cytopenia in pts, the development of TTP needs to be considered. Early recognition/treatment with TPE of this drug induced autoimmune disorder necessitates clinical hyperawareness during the post therapy surveillance period for this at risk pt population. Further studies regarding the risk and etiology of TTP in this setting are warranted.TA5Antibody Mediated Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage in Pulmonary-Renal Vasculitides: Enhanced Resolution with Emergent Adjunctive Plasma Exchange Jan C. Hofmann* and Dobri D. Kiprov. California Pacific Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Antibody mediated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in pulmonary-renal vasculitides is an acute, often life-threatening condition. While high dose immunosuppressive (IS) therapy is paramount in controlling this condition, plasma exchange often proves to be critically important. Study Design/Method: We reviewed the medical records of 81 patients (pts) who were diagnosed with DAH from 1/08-1/18, and referred for immunotherapy evaluation and treatment. Of 192 pts with ANCA (antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody) or anti-GBM (anti-glomerular basement membrane) antibody renal vasculitis (RV), or severe SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) treated with adjunctive plasma exchange during this 10-year period, 42.2% (81/192) pts were diagnosed with DAH: 43.0% (37/86) pts with myeloperoxidase positive ANCA RV, 40.4% (23/57) pts with proteinase-3 positive ANCA RV, 32.1% (9/28) pts with anti-GBM RV, and 57.1% (12/21) pts with severe SLE. Pts were defined as having DAH if the pt had progressive hemoptysis and/or evidence of DAH by bronchoscopy. Median pt age was 54 years (19-85 years old; 59% (48/81) pts were female. Majority of pts presented with cough, dypsnea, and hemoptysis; hypoxemia; and diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities. 84% (68/81) pts underwent bronchoscopy; 73% (59/81) pts were intubated during hospitalization. All pts received the following IS regimen: high dose corticosteroid (CS) therapy, plasma exchange (TPE), and cyclophosphamide (CP) or rituximab (RTM). Pts received pulse CS (methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV X 3-5 days) followed by prolonged prednisone taper (initially 1 mg/kg/day), and CP (500-750 mg/m 2 IV every 4 weeks or 75-150 mg/day PO, for 3-6 months) or RTM (375 mg/m 2 weekly X 4 weeks, or alternate bi-weekly protocol X 2 infusions). Pts received daily TPE treatments (1-1.5 plasma volumes with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) replacement, or 5% albumin followed by FFP, 0.5-0.75 plasma volume each) until DAH resolved. TPE treatments (txs) were initiated within 4-8 hours of the referral. Results/Finding: 88% (71/81) pts experienced resolution of DAH \u22647 days after starting IS regimen. Resolution of DAH was defined as: complete (or near complete) resolution of alveolar bleeding or hemoptysis, and improvement in oxygenation (decrease in FI02 requirements \u2265 0.30, and/or increase in SA02 \u2265 10%), with or without improvement in chest x-ray findings). The mean number of TPE txs was 3.7 (2-8 txs). 88% (52/59) of intubated pts were extubated. 86% (70/81) pts had significant improvement in oxygenation and 77% (62/81) pts had decreased pulmonary infiltrates. 11% (9/81) pts died of complications of pneumonia and sepsis. 7% (6/81) pts experienced recurrent DAH over a median follow-up of 67 months (3-117 months). Study limitations include: 1) retrospective case series, and 2) no historical control group. Conclusion: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is an uncommon, but potentially life-threatening complication of pulmonary-renal vasculitides, including SLE. High dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide or rituximab, and plasma exchange are useful treatment modalities and, when initiated promptly, appear to be highly effective in providing rapid resolution of antibody mediated alveolar hemorrhage.TA6 Individual Selection and Plasmapheresis Help to Fight Refractoriness to Transfusions of Platelet Concentrates in Hematological Patients Anzhelika Rakhmani*, Elena Mikhaylova, Igor Dubinkin, Olga Kalmikova, Vladimir Galuzyak, Vera Troitskaya and Tatjana Gaponova. National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian FederationBackground/Case Studies: Refractoriness to platelets concentrates (PC) transfusions adversely affects the conduction of comprehensive therapy in hematological patients. Individual selection of PC is recommended for such cases. When individual PC selection is complicated because of the high degree of alloimmunization due to the formation of antibodies (HLA/HPA), plasmapheresis procedures (PPs) are included in the treatment program. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of transfusions of individual selected PC for patients with refractoriness, and the use of PPs as the second line of therapy. Study Design/Method: From September 2015 to December 2017, 91 out of 1263 hematological patients with PC transfusion showed refractoriness and were enrolled in the study. All enrolled patients received PC transfusions after individual selection by cross-matching using Immucor Capture-P solid phase technology. In 28 (30%) out of 91 patient individual PC selection was unsuccessful so PPs were used as a second line of therapy. on average -4) for each patient. All patients after the PP procedure immediately received transfusions of individually selected by cross-matching PC. The efficacy of PC transfusions was assessed by API, CCI, and hemorrhagic syndrome relief. Results/Finding: In 26 of 28 patients with refractory to PC transfusions, in the absence of compatible donor's platelets, PPs in combination with subsequent transfusions of individually selected PCs promoted relief of hemorrhagic syndrome, change in API from 3,3\u0445109/l to 29,5 x109/l and CCI from 1,3 to 10,7. PPs combined with individual selection of PC allowed reducing the degree of alloimmunization (ratio of incompatible donor-recipient pairs during PC selection, %): for patients with AA (n=4) -from 91.7% to 50.2%; MDS (n=8) -from 89.6% to 31.6%; AML (n=12) -86.0% to 40.5% and ALL (n=4) -from 91.7% to 37.7%. In 2 patients with high degree of alloimmunization after PPs, selection of compatible platelets was unsuccessful, and therefore PC transfusions were ineffective (API = 5 x109/l, CCI=1), and hemorrhagic syndrome was not completely managed, although its severity was reduced. Conclusion: Development of refractoriness to PC transfusions and unsuccessful individual selection of platelet in one hematological patient calls for PPs as the second line of therapy. PPs combined with the individual selection of PCs decreases the degree of alloimmunization, and therefore increase donor-recipient compatibility and clinical efficacy of PC transfusions. When PPs combined with the individual selection of PCs is ineffective, it is necessary to seek for the syndrome of increased consumption and other mechanisms of development of refractoriness.TA7Mathematical Model and Smartphone App for Predicting Coagulation Factor Levels after Therapeutic Plasma Exchange Ray Zhang* 1 , Aaron Dahl 1 , Bryan Marchant 1 , Ronald Jackups 1 , Hope Karnes 2 , Priyank Shah 1 , Marian Dynis 3 , Suzanne Thibodeaux 1 and George Despotis 1 . 1 Washington University School of Medicine, 2 Veteran Affairs Medical Center, 3 Barnes-Jewish Hospital",

Fresenius Kabi Background/Case Studies: While the mechanism of action of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has not been fully elucidated, several theories ascribe a key role to ECP treated lymphocytes as the starting point for the immunological cascade that follows in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to ECP; a majority become apoptotic 48-72 hours post treatment. The reported effects of ECP on monocytes have been mixed. Short term studies show that monocytes are resistant to apoptosis, while longer term studies show that monocyte viability is ultimately impacted by ECP. Additional studies on monocyte to dendritic cell (DC) maturation post ECP have suggested that monocytes treated with lower doses of ultraviolet A (UVA) light differentiate into mature DCs while those treated with larger doses of UVA become immature DCs. In light of these reports, an investigation was undertaken to evaluate the impact of nominal and high UVA dose ECP on monocyte apoptosis and differentiation into DCs. Study Design/Method: Mononuclear cells obtained from healthy subjects using leukapheresis were diluted with plasma and saline and transferred to polyolefin treatment containers. 8-Methoxypsoralen was added (330 ng/mL) and the cells were treated with either 1.5 (nominal) or 3.0 (high) J/cm 2 of UVA light under constant agitation (1 Hz) using a standalone photoactivation device. ECP treated cells and leukapheresis only controls were purified using density gradient separation and cultured for up to 3 days in 10% human serum or plasma in RPMI 1640 with 2 mM glutamine in gas permeable containers at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Flow cytometric analyses included lymphocyte and monocyte apoptosis (LA and MA, respectively) and monocyte/DC subsets and enumeration. Cytokine induced DCs were prepared as positive controls from healthy subject monocytes. Results/Finding: LA levels were higher in ECP arms compared to controls throughout storage, with levels converging to 90-95% in the ECP arms by Day 3 vs 14% in controls (n = 5 per arm). MA levels on Day 1 were similar between control and nominal UVA (14 vs 16%, p=0.72), which were both lower than high UVA (53%, p<0.01). After Day 1, MA levels in nominal UVA increased above controls and approached levels in high UVA by Day 3 (81 vs 92%, p=0.06) compared to 27% in the control (p<0.02). Approximately 5% of monocytes differentiated into mature DCs overnight in nominal UVA and controls (p=0.79) compared to 2% in high UVA (p<0.04). During storage, mature DC levels declined more rapidly in the ECP treated arms. Immature DC levels remained low (1% or less on average) during storage in all arms. Conclusion: ECP treatment promoted monocyte apoptosis and reduced the number of monocyte-derived mature DCs during in vitro culture. ECP with high UVA doses led to a more rapid decline of monocyte viability and did not promote monocyte differentiation into immature DCs. The implication of these findings with respect to ECP's mechanism of action remains to be determined.TA9Heterogeneity of Pediatric Apheresis Provider Opinions and Utilization PatternsLaura Cooling* 1 , Meghan Delaney 2 and Jay S.

Kiss 2 , Joan Sevcik 3 and Alesia Kaplan 1 . 1 Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, 2 Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, 3 Blood Systems Inc.Background/Case Studies: Urgent red blood cell (RBC) exchange is required for sickle cell patients with severe complications such as acute chest syndrome and stroke. There is no consensus on the recommended time from request to initiation of RBC exchange in these patients. Study Design/Method: A retrospective review of the electronic medical records and blood bank records from 2012 to 2016 was conducted to identify patients with complications of sickle cell disease requiring an urgent RBC exchange procedure at three hospitals serviced by a centralized hemapheresis center. Demographics, clinical features and laboratory parameters, such as hemoglobin/hematocrit, hemoglobin fractionation results and history of RBC alloantibodies, and temporal parameters, including time of procedure request, line placement, nurse/ equipment arrival, time of RBC issue and start of the procedure, as well as outcome data were recorded. Results/Finding: Thirty-eight patients (22 females and 16 males, mean age 30 \u00b1 15 years) received a total of 42 RBC exchanges for stroke/ TIA (13) and acute chest syndrome (29). Thirty patient had SS disease, 3 patients had SC disease, 4 patients had S/\u03b2 thalassemia and 1 patient had S/ O(Arab) disease. Nine patients (24%) had current/historic RBC antibodies. Most (40/42) procedures were performed using central venous access; two procedures were performed using peripheral access. Temporal data for major steps in the process are shown inTable 1. The presence of current or historic RBC alloantibodies did not result in a significantly longer time to initiation of RBC exchange (p=0.09, independent samples t-test). All procedures were successful in reaching targeted hematocrit and fraction of cells remaining. There were no in-hospital deaths. Conclusion: The major delay in initiating urgent RBC exchange was due to finding compatible RBC products (Rh, Kell match and honoring allo RBC antibodies) and not in obtaining central venous access. Benchmarking the steps of urgent RBC exchange in sickle cell patients can facilitate quality improvement of the process and establishment of local and national guidelines for patients with severe complications of sickle cell disease.TA11 Efficiency of Plasma Exchange in Patients with Inflammatory Dilated Cardiomyopathy Victoria Kulikova* 1 , Alexandr Nedostup 1 , Olga Blagova 1 , Vladimir Zaidenov 2 , Ilya Nechaev 1 and Aligeydar Ragimov 1 . 1 I.M.

Finnish Red Cross Blood Service Background/Case Studies: Erythrocytapheresis (automated RBC exchange transfusion, RBCX) is increasingly used in the treatment of sickle cell disease, with benefits over simple transfusion including the ability to limit iron loading. Erythrocytapheresis practice was initiated in Finland in February 2017 at a single center. All blood products in Finland are provided by a single blood bank, which allowed the monitoring of the use for phenotyped RBC units in erythrocytopheresis practice and consequently the adequacy of the supply of phenotyped blood. Study Design/Method: Data of RBC units provided by the blood bank to the erythrocytapheresis center was collected during 2/2017 -3/2018. The patients were genotyped well in advance before the start of the treatment by using the ID Core XT kit. RBC units used in erythrocytapheresis were always matched for RhCE and K, and for JK, FY and Ss whenever such units were available in stock. Fy(a-b-) patients were matched for Fya but not for Fyb. Starting from the beginning of 2018, after a patient had been transfused with 12 units unmatched for a certain antigen, the particular antigen was not matched in future transfusions. Phenotype matched units were reserved for each patient starting from one week before the procedure. Blood group determination, antibody screening and crossmatching were done by the blood bank on the day before the procedure, and crossmatched units were sent to the treatment center. Results/Finding: Eleven patients (age 1-44 years) received 2-16 RBCX each during the study period of 13 months. The number of RBC units used varied from 3 to 12 per RBCX and 10-166 per patient. Four patients received fully phenotype matched units only. Of the units transfused to the seven other patients, 56 % were unmatched for one or more antigens. Jkb was the antigen that was most often not matched: 293 Jkb positive units were transferred to five Jkb negative patients. In addition, 142 S positive units were transferred to S negative patients, 24 Fyb positive units to one Fy(a+b-) patient, and 17 Fya positive units to four Fy(a-b-) patients. In order to match the R 0 (Dce) phenotype, which is common in people of African ancestry, but rare in Europeans, 408 RhD negative units were transferred to RhD positive patients. None of the patients were alloimmunized during the study period. Conclusion: Erythrocytapheresis practice requires careful planning in a close collaboration between blood bank, laboratory and treatment center. Erythrocytapheresis with phenotype matched RBC units poses a challenge to the supply of phenotyped blood, because of the large number of units required, but furthermore due to the differences in ethnicity between donor and patient populations. This necessitates the review of donor phenotyping strategies and highlights the importance of recruiting blood donors representing ethnic minorities. TA18 Central Venous Catheter Infection Rate with Use of Chlorhexidine Gluconate 2% Rebecca T. Lewis*, Grace B. Sese, Ashley Marinacci, Jennifer Scott and Joanne Im. Inova Fairfax Medical Campus Background/Case Studies: Multiple clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) to reduce infection. The most common complication of long-term tunneled catheter is central line associated bloodstream related infections (CLABSI) which strongly contributes to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Patients requiring the use of a central venous catheter (CVC) as an access either for hemodialysis, Apheresis and others have been found to have an increased risk CLABSI. The CDC issued guidelines to reduce CLABSI August, 2002. This process to reduce CLABSI was implemented in our Apheresis department prior to March 2003. There are several recommended antiseptic agents: 2% CHG, tincture of iodine, iodophor and 70% alcohol. Biopatch\u00ae was added in 2003 for CVC dressing changes with Apheresis patients (pts). Study Design/Method: Data was collected retrospectively. In March 2003 the new process was implemented to reduce CLABSI. The patients were either on long-term (>6 months) or short-term ( < 3 weeks) use of CVC. CVC site was disinfected with betadine swabs followed by occlusive dressing. The CVC dressing was changed every 48 hours. In March 2003 the skin adjacent to the CVC was antiseptically cleansed during dressing changes with CHG & Biopatch\u00ae applied. The frequency of CVC infection was calculated. CHG is a cationic biquanide with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It is shown to be active against most of the pathogens using long-term catheters. There have been no reports on the resistance patterns for CHG. It is a purely topical agent with minimal to no absorption from the skin, and without any reported toxic effects. Biopatch\u00ae is a hydrophilic foam impregnated with CHG, designed to deliver a large amount in the first 3 days, followed by a steady release for the next 7 days. This antiseptic dressing has been shown to decrease the skin microbial colonization at the exit site, thus reducing the catheter tip colonization. Results/Finding: Prior to implementation of CHG for CVC line dressing, the rate of CVC line related infection was about 11-13% in 2002. The infection rate significantly declined to 1.23% from January to September, 2004. Thereafter, the annual rate a 0.0% rate or the absence of CVC related infection was achieved and maintained from late 2004 until 2017. Early 2018 data remains similar. Conclusion: CHG along with Biopatch\u00ae has decreased the incidence of CVC line infection for patients undergoing Apheresis procedures at Inova Fairfax Medical Campus' Apheresis department. The application of Bio-patch\u00ae significantly decreased the incidence of exit site infections.

Results/Finding: A total of 48 patients were identified, but 8 were excluded due to lack of baseline fibrinogen before TPE. One patient underwent two separate series of TPE. TPE was initiated for neurologic disorders in 27 (65.9%) patients, renal-related disorders in 11 (29.3%) patients, and other disorders in 2 (4.9%) patients. Of the 41 TPE series included, in 31 (73.8%) series the patient received steroids and in 11 (26.2%) series the patient did not receive steroids. Of the patients taking steroids, 16 required FFP while 15 did not require FFP at any point during the TPE series. Of the patients not taking steroids, 3 required FFP and 7 did not require FFP at any point during the TPE series. Patients on steroids were no more likely than patients not on steroids to require FFP at any point during the TPE series (p=0.4913). Fibrinogen recovery before the last TPE procedure was compared for patients who received only 5% albumin; mean fibrinogen of patients on steroids was 77.3% of baseline while mean fibrinogen of patients not on steroids was 69.1% (p=0.7199). Conclusion: Steroid use was not associated with a higher risk of using FFP at any time during the TPE series. For patients receiving only 5% albumin during the TPE series, the fibrinogen recovery did not differ between patients on steroids and those not on steroids. In this small sample, steroids had no effect on fibrinogen in patients receiving only 5% albumin during TPE.TTB1Cardiac Valve Allograft Decontamination and Bioburden Reduction as a Tissue Banking Process Christina Crossie 1 , Graeme Dowling 1 and Jelena L.

Results/Finding: The patient received 18 blood components prepared from 25 donors in the perioperative period. Patient/suspect platelet donor events are summarized inTable 1. All donors contacted during lookback investigation denied symptoms of WNV in the month after donation. Negative followup serologic results were also obtained for 9 donors, corroborating negative symptom reports; the remaining were lost to follow-up. Conclusion: We describe a case of fatal neuroinvasive WNV disease in a heart transplant recipient, presumably acquired from a WNV ID-NAT negative platelet transfusion identified during a lookback investigation. The low S/CO in the ID-NAT positive donation likely represents the tail end of the donor's viremic period. The suspect ID-NAT negative donation, 26 days earlier, suggests the donor was in the initial phases of WNV infection with viral load below that which is reliably detected by ID-NAT. The small residual risk of TT-WNV when viral load is below levels detectable by ID-NAT may best be addressed by pathogen reduction technologies, as well as robust mosquito surveillance and control measures.TS29 Monocyte Monolayer Assay (MMA) to Predict Clinical Significance of Alloantibodies: A 22-Year Review Joan L.

The study objective was to assess TRA occurrence and potential risk factors among the inpatient US elderly, ages 65 and older, during 2012-2017 study period. Study Design/Method: This retrospective claims-based study utilized large Medicare databases for January 1, 2012-April 30, 2017 in coordination with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Transfusions were identified by recorded procedure and revenue center codes, and TRA was ascertained via the diagnosis codes. Our study evaluated TRA rates (per 100,000 inpatient transfusion stays) among the elderly, overall and by calendar year, age, gender, race, number of units and blood components transfused. Fisher's exact tests were performed to compare TRA rates, and Cochran-Armitage tests were used to ascertain TRA occurrence trends by calendar year, age, and transfusion volume. Results/Finding: Among 10,073,077 inpatient transfusion stays for elderly beneficiaries during 2012-2017, 711 had a TRA diagnosis code recorded, an overall rate of 7.1 per 100,000 stays. TRA rates (per 100,000) varied by calendar year, blood components and number of units transfused as well as by age, sex, and race. Annual TRA rates were 8.Our population-based study is the largest-to-date among U.S elderly and suggests a decline in TRA occurrence over time. The findings show substantially higher TRA rates with plasma and/or platelet transfusions as compared to RBCs only. The study also identified a significantly increased TRA rates with greater number of units transfused and a reduced TRA risk with advancing age. Our investigation suggests increased TRA risk in males versus females and in whites versus non-whites, which needs further investigation. Study was based on claims data, and thus limitations include potential under-or mis-recording of transfusion procedures, units, and diagnosis codes, as well as lack of clinical details to validate recorded TRA.TS32Post-Transfusion Purpura (PTP) Among the U.S. Elderly Medicare Beneficiaries, As Recorded during 2011-2017 Mikhail Menis* 1 , Richard Forshee 1 , Barbee I.

PTP rates (per 100,000) varied by calendar year, age, blood components and number of units transfused. Annual PTP rates were 1.9 in 2011, 1.6 in 2012, 1.4 in 2013, 1.Our population-based study is the largest-to-date and shows a significantly increasing PTP risk over time and with greater number of units transfused. The study also identified a substantially higher PTP rates with platelet transfusions, either alone or in combination with RBCs and/or plasma. Our investigation suggests decline in PTP risk with advancing age and no risk difference by race and gender, which need further investigation. The study was based on claims data and thus limitations include potential under-or mis-recording of diagnosis code, transfusion procedures, and units transfused, as well as lack of clinical details to validate the recorded PTP diagnosis.TS33A Retrospective Evaluation of the Hemostatic Efficacy of Pathogen Reduced (PR) vs Conventional (CONV) Platelets at an Academic Medical Center Eric Gehrie* 1,2 , Wade L.

To mitigate the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, we transitioned our platelet inventory from CONV platelets to FDA-approved, psoralen-treated PR platelets. From December 2016 to March 2018, we maintained a dual inventory due to supply constraints from our blood supplier. Both PR platelets and CONV platelets analyzed with a bacterial detection assay were considered standard of care and were dispensed as available per Pre-and post-Transfusion NT-proBNP levels*",

Of these, 949 patients received 1,429 transfusions of CONV platelets (1.5 \u00b1 1.2 transfusions/patient). In addition, 601 patients received 959 PR platelet transfusions (1.6 \u00b1 1.8 transfusions/patient), which was similar to the CONV group (p=0.28). In patients who received only CONV platelets during the study interval, 600 also received RBCs with an average of 6.5 RBC transfusions/ patient. Similarly, for those who received only PR platelets, 351 received RBCs, with an average of 5.6 RBC transfusions/patient. We also assessed RBC utilization in the first 24 hours after platelet transfusion, as a proxy for hemostatic efficacy. We again found that RBC utilization was similar, with an average of 2.3 RBC units/patient within 24 hours of receipt of a platelet transfusion in those receiving only CONV platelets, and an average of 2.6 RBC units/patient in those receiving only PR platelets (p=0.43). Conclusion: During our 16-month period of dual inventory, we determined that platelet usage patterns were similar in patients receiving only CONV or only PR platelet products. While not a direct measure of product efficacy, the additional evidence showing similar RBC utilization patterns in these groups suggests that the hemostatic efficacy of PR platelets is comparable to that of CONV platelet products.TS34 Gender Differences Unmasked by Suboptimal Interval between Perioperative Autologous Blood Donation and Surgery Sara Bakhtary*, Elena Nedelcu and Solmaz Manuel.

The ACS's Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) introduced massive transfusion protocol (MTP) guidelines in 2014 and all Level One Trauma Centers were required to have a MTP program by 2015. We received initial ACS verification of our trauma center in September 2014 with successful re-verification in 2017. Here we summarize the necessary blood bank (BB) resources implemented to ensure successful ACS verification/re-verification of our trauma center. Study Design/Method: Beginning 2 years before our initial verification visit, the Division of Trauma and the BB collaborated to meet the MTP requirements.1. A minimum of 10 O negative/10 O positive PRBCs, 8 AB/A thawed plasma and 2 platelets made available at all times. 2. A complete review/update of MTP written policy that established: 1. Time standards for delivery of blood products. 1. 15 minutes (min) for 1st MTP pack (4units PRBCs/ 4units Plasma/ 1unit Platelet). 2. PRBC/Plasma/Platelet transfusion ratio best practices. 3. A MTP flow chart placed in all operating rooms. 4. An on-line presentation created for MTP re-education as part of the Trauma Center's internal educational process. All Emergency Medicine, Neurosurgery, Orthopedic and Trauma surgeons required to review presentation. 5. An MTP worksheet designed for BB personnel to document all communications and time of issue for each MTP pack with retrospective monitoring of performance by Transfusion Safety Officer. 6. An electronic database for all MTPS created in 2014 and a MTP Performance Improvement Committee formed collaboratively between the BB and Division of Trauma. 1. Meetings held monthly to assess performance indicators, outcome analysis and necessary changes to the process. Results/Finding: The number of MTPs, average turnaround Time (TAT), % compliance with 15 min. TAT, average number of units of PRBCs, plasma, platelets and average PRBC:Plasma Ratio through the years is illustrated below. All MTPs have a quality audit which includes review of MTP worksheet and video of trauma team activations. An average TAT of 4 to 6 min. was demonstrated for delivery of first MTP pack. Evaluation of our process has indicated that a minimum of 3 staff is required to ensure uninterrupted MTP service. Frequency of perceived TAT issues, lack of appropriate notification, order confusion and wastage have remained minimal. Conclusion: An MTP process and quality review system collaboratively created by the BB and Division of Trauma has been robust at our center ensuring prospectively agreed upon standards. A high level of compliance with a 15 min. TAT for the 1st MTP pack and a low PRBC:Plasma ratio is attainable. Close collaboration between the BB and the Division of Trauma is imperative in successful planning, implementation and ongoing review of an MTP process.

These storage lesions are supposed to affect safety of senescent PRBCs, but it is still debated whether transfusion of senescent PRBCs increases risk for recurrent disease after surgery for cancer. Study Design/Method: Patients were identified from the prospectively maintained Tumor Bank Ovarian Cancer database. Patients were eligible if they underwent surgical tumor debulking due to primary ovarian cancer between 2006 and 2014, had complete cytoreduction after surgery, received transfusion of allogeneic PRBCs during hospital stay, and had PRBC storage data available. According to their oldest unit of PRBCs transfused, patients were assigned to 4 PRBC storage groups: \u2264 21, 22 to 28, 29 to 35, and long-term storage > 35 days. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to remove the effect of confounders on outcome. An ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee (Charit\u00e9 -Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, No. EA4/128/17). Results/Finding: A total of 408 patients with a median follow-up of 47.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.2-58.9) were eligible for analysis. There was an inhomogeneity in patients' characteristics including cancer stage, surgical complexity and transfusion requirements between the 4 PRBC storage groups. In unadjusted analysis, patients transfused with PRBCs stored for 22 to 28, 29 to 35, as well as >35 days were not at higher risk for cancer recurrence or death compared to patients transfused with PRBCs stored for \u226421 days (hazard ratio of DFS 0.95 [95% CI, 0.65-1.38], P = 0.77; HR 0.73 [0.5-1.07], P = 0.11; and HR 1.19 [0.84-1.72], P = 0.32). In PSM adjusted analysis, patients' characteristics were well balanced and it was confirmed that PRBC storage did not affect disease-free survival after ovarian cancer surgery. Conclusion: Transfusion of senescent PRBCs and even long-term stored PRCBs > 35 days is not related to worse oncological outcomes in patients without macroscopic tumor residuals after ovarian cancer surgery who received perioperative RBCT during hospitalization. TS39 Hemovigilance in Massachusetts: A Three-Year Data Summary Anthony Osinski* and Melissa Cumming. Massachusetts Department of Public HealthBackground/Case Studies: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) is the first state health department to require reporting of blood products transfused and adverse reactions (ARs) following transfusion via the National Healthcare Safety Network Hemovigilance Module (HM). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring blood bank activity in this way and summarize three years of data. Study Design/Method: Blood banks in MA reported transfusion, AR, and facility data according to the HM surveillance protocol. Analytic datasets for each data type were extracted and analyzed with SAS 9.3. Complete reporting months from 2015 to 2017, defined as months for which a facility reported both transfusion data and the presence or absence of ARs, were included in analysis. ARs failing to meet imputability or case criteria requirements, and other, unknown, or non-severe allergic ARs were excluded. AR rates were the number of ARs attributable to a particular group of products divided by the number transfused in that group. Facilities were categorized into three bed size groups according to the number of total beds licensed. Results/Finding: In total, 2,503 reporting months from 70 facilities were analyzed. Over the three-year period, 1,099,347 blood products were transfused. Annual transfusion volume decreased each year from 372,990 products in 2015 to 356,589 products in 2017. Discarded products totaled 81,351, also decreasing each year. A total of 1,722 ARs were reported of ten defined types. ARs increased each year from 501 in 2015 to 657 in 2017. AR rates by product type for the period were: 17.4 ARs per 10,000 RBC units transfused, 21.4 ARs per 10,000 platelet units transfused, and 5.2 ARs per 10,000 plasma units transfused. The platelet AR rate increased an average of 1 AR per 10,000 platelet units transfused per quarter. AR rates by facility ranged from 0 to 152 per 10,000 total products transfused. Conclusion:",

Johanna Wiksten*, Susanne Ekblom-Kullberg and Susanna Sainio. Finnish Red Cross Blood Service Background/Case Studies: The Finnish Red Cross Blood Service (FRC BS) is responsible for supplying blood products in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million. As of 2007, in accordance with the EU blood directive, serious adverse reactions (ARs) and events (AEs) that may affect the quality and safety of blood components must be immediately reported to the Blood Safety Office of FRC BS. Mild adverse reactions, incorrect blood components transfused (IBCTs), and near miss events are reported annually. Study Design/Method: All AEs reported in 2008-2017 were analyzed and classified as adverse reactions (ARs), IBCTs, or near miss events according to ISBT standard definitions. Results/Finding: The total number of blood components (NAT screened, leukodepleted) and plasma (S/D treated pooled plasma, OctaplasLG\u00ae) distributed from FRCBS to hospitals was 3 051 622 products, with a steady decline of 24% in use seen from 2008 to 2017. A total of 2480 ARs and 214 IBCTs (of which 20% ABO incompatible) were reported, the number remaining steady over the study period. The incidence of all ARs was 93.3 per 100 000 components issued, and the rate of serious ARs was 6.4 per 100 000. Of the 196 severe ARs, 38% were related to allergy/anaphylaxis, 21% to hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTR or DHTR), 14% to transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), 8% to transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI), and 8% to transfusion associated dyspnea (TAD). Transfusion-associated infections were extremely rare, with bacterial infection confirmed only in 4 cases (0.1 per 100 000).

Siniard, Stefanie G. Finch, Karen L. Smith and Raj S. Kasthuri. University of North Carolina Background/Case Studies: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder resulting in the formation of abnormal blood vessels. These patients develop recurrent, spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding and may require RBC transfusion. It has been previously suggested that HHT patients have an increased risk of RBC alloimmunization, with 15.3% of transfused individuals developing an RBC alloantibody, and thus may benefit from a RBC antigen matching policy(Zheng Y et al,  2018). As we do not currently provide extended antigen matched RBCs for our HHT patients, we sought to characterize RBC alloimmunization in these individuals. Study Design/Method: A prospectively maintained HHT patient registry at our institution was queried for performance of type and screen, RBC transfusion (including number of units), and RBC alloantibody formation. Findings were compared against previously collected data on RBC alloimmunization after simple transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that necessitates extended RBC antigen matching with Rh/Kell compatible units at our institution.Results/Finding: Of 467 HHT patients, 34 (7.3%) had been transfused with RBCs, and 7 of these 34 (20.6%) had RBC alloantibodies. Five of these patients had anti-E, one had anti-K, and one had anti-V. All patients had only one RBC alloantibody each, and all patients had been transfused with \u22655 RBC units (median 14, range 5-28). Compared to those 7 who developed an RBC alloantibody, the 27 HHT patients that did not develop alloantibodies were transfused with significantly fewer RBC units (median 4, range 1-18; p<0.01). There was no association between alloimmunization and ABO group. RBC alloimmunization in our HHT patients was markedly greater compared to the 11% of our SCD patients that developed an RBC alloantibody after simple transfusion(Desai PC et al, 2015). It was interesting that only 105 of our HHT patients (22.5%) had a type and screen performed. Conclusion: The rate of alloimmunization in transfused HHT patients is high at our institution and greater than that of transfused SCD patients. HHT patients transfused with many RBC units at our institution appear to have a high rate of RBC alloimmunization compared to those HHT patients receiving fewer units. It is unclear what patient or transfusion factors predispose certain HHT individuals to develop an RBC alloantibody. As this is a condition that may result in bleeding requiring RBC transfusion, we recommend that a type and screen be performed on all HHT patients, particularly since 2 valid assessments are now recommended prior to the issue of typespecific blood components. Given the rarity of HHT, multicenter studies are needed to determine whether an antigen matching strategy is appropriate for all or a subset of these patients.TS42 Granulocyte Transfusion in Medical Management of Neutropenic Acute Appendicitis Colin H.

SD: standard deviation, EGA: estimated gestational age, SDP: single donor platelet, %-IPF: percent immature platelet fraction, A-IPC: absolute immature platelet count, PPR: percent platelet recovery. Conclusion: There may be a trend towards higher count recovery in the presence of higher A-IPC. Higher number of patients will determine if these trends become statistically significant and if the potential benefit of higher A-IPC content of a unit is affected by irradiation of SDP units destined for neonatal transfusion. This case illustrates the importance of careful clinical evaluation and correlation with laboratory test results in order to provide the best care for obstetrical patients. Study Design/Method: A 35 year old group A, RhD-negative woman in her 2 nd pregnancy received a dose of RhIg at 28 weeks of gestation. She gave birth to a healthy group A, RhD-positive male baby via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks of gestation following an uneventful pregnancy. Eight vials of RhIg were administered to the mother postpartum after KB test revealed 5% fetal erythrocytes in maternal blood corresponding to estimated FMH of 240 mL. The KB test result and RhIg requirements was evaluated further at our daily management meeting where it was determined to perform further investigation. Results/Finding: The neonate clinical status was reviewed indicating no evidence of neonatal distress. The lack of correlation between the clinical picture and lab results triggered further laboratory investigation. Although a repeat of KB test was persistently elevated, a negative rosette test subsequently confirmed disparity in the calculated FMH suggesting the possibility of secondary causes of elevated HbF in maternal serum. Hgb electrophoresis revealed HbF of 2.3% before and 2.0% after delivery suggestive of elevation of maternal F cells during pregnancy or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Other hematological parameters were normal making the probability of maternal thalassemia minor or other hemoglobinopathies less likely. Conclusion: This case highlights the need for real time clinical correlation of patients with positive KB test results. This is especially important for patients with high volumes of estimated FMH based on results of the KB test. If the clinical picture is not consistent with a high volume of FMH, additional investigation must be performed in order to prevent unnecessary RhIg administration. Through a well-defined workflow and an internal benchmark, we demonstrated improvements in efficiency and target TAT compliance for RX and RO URBC by 0.6% and 35.3% respectively.

Fellows scoring in the 1 st quartile are at lower risk of failing TM boards. Results/Finding: A total of 293 transfusion medicine laboratory professionals were invited to take this survey, and responses were received from 84 (28.7%). The majority of our respondents were MT/MLS/CLS (68.7%), followed by SBB/BB/SH (44.6%). Approximately half (51.8%) of respondents had greater than 20 years of experience in the clinical laboratory. 40% of these in the last 10 years;Table 1). Three of the formerly accredited fellowship programs merged into a single program in 2002, and two others subsequently reopened in 2009 and 2015, respectively.

Both programs cited several years with a lack of applicants and significant ACGME administrative requirements to maintain accreditation as primary reasons for withdrawal. As of April 2018, two additional TM fellowship programs have been accredited to open in July 2018 with one position each. Conclusion: While the number of TM fellowship programs has remained steady since 2009, the number of available positions has increased. Onethird of these TM fellowship positions are unfilled annually, giving credence to the anecdotal difficulty in securing a fellow each year.

The medical director (MD) informed staff to provide anonymous concerns and recommendations about quality or safety. Access to the suggestion box is limited to the MD to ensure a mechanism for feedback that could involve senior peers or managers. All submitted suggestions are acknowledged as received by email on a weekly basis. Submissions are distributed to an accountable member of the executive management team and discussed at a monthly Executive Management Quality Meeting to determine actions. Implemented changes are communicated to staff in monthly meetings with MD, and staff is engaged to work out options for optimal resolution such as work flow changes and equipment selection. A retrospective review of all submissions since 2009 was performed. Each was categorized based on the Quality System Essentials (QSEs) used by AABB Standards. Items that did not align with a QSE were categorized as Work Culture. The percent resulting in a change was calculated overall and by category. Results/Finding: A total of 150 suggestions were received. Ten were not valid quality or safety concerns. There were 113 categorized by QSE, summarized inTable 1. There were 8 recurrences of 2 items (not included inTable 1data): one concerned IBST bar code scanners and the other cross coverage scheduling. There were 19 items classified as Work Culture, which included employee recognition, holiday staffing, and recycling suggestions. The primary reasons an entry did not result in change included cost, a preexisting alternate solution, or suggestions referred to a supplier or customer.Conclusion:The added suggestion box has become a productive component of the facility's quality system providing feedback across most QSEs. Overall, 77% of suggestions resulted in a meaningful change or addition including work culture enhancements. The findings indicate success of the suggestion box and employee engagement in continuous quality improvement. rd quartile and minimum/maximum outliers. A threshold line was added to the hct chart indicating results \u2265 40% met acceptance criteria as determined by AT. A threshold line was added to the hep chart indicating results \u2264 0.30 u/mL met acceptance criteria. Each quarter, all box plots were reviewed with the prior quarter results to track and trend the performance of each device. Results/Finding: Quarterly data showed that all 22 devices produced a mean QC result that met acceptance criteria. All identified outliers that did not meet acceptance criteria were investigated and QC was repeated with acceptable results. When reviewing each quarter at the end of 2017, AT identified two salvage devices box plots with significantly wider quartiles that the other devices. As a result of this review, the two devices were removed from service due to the wide variability of QC results. Conclusion: Utilizing box plots to monitor QC results are effective when managing multiple pieces of equipment at multiple locations.

The baseline TDN rate showed that 59.6% of patients, prior to intervention, had at least one incorrect or incomplete portion of their transfusion record. After education and role definition for nurses that perform transfusions, the TDN rate was lowered to 14.7% of patients being impacted the end of 2014. The interdisciplinary group of nurses, Transfusion Medicine personnel, and process engineers continued to meet and determined that an option to scan the blood's ISBT barcodes into the EMR, rather than manually typing the information into the EMR, should be developed. Additionally, the scope of the project included the Trauma Center which was recording all transfusion information from a trauma visit by hand on a paper document and the form was later scanned into the patient's EMR. Study Design/Method: The ED EMR programmer created fields that would accept data entry via barcode scanner for transfusion charting with the intention that both ED patients and Trauma Center patients would have transfusions charted in this manner. The barcode scanners in the ED and on the transfusion nurses' (IVTX) mobile computer carts were configured to read ISBT barcode labels. These scanners were tested while the nurses practiced scanning training units into the validation environment of the EMR. The scanners went into use in 2 nd quarter 2015.",

Initial challenges with charting transfusions in the EMR using a scanner included ensuring that all units were documented which was addressed through additional education and practice. Another source of error emerged, where the scanner would randomly drop a digit of the unit number or product code. IT resources were able to address the root of this source of error, and the TDN rate remains lower than it was prior to scanner implementation. 02X10E3/\u03bcL or greater were considered positive.

Results/Finding: The table summarizes the validity results for single donor platelets (SDP) and whole blood-derived platelets (PSPP or WBPC). Conclusion: The CBC does not have power of discrimination to produce an official count at WBC levels required to certify units as leuko-reduced yet it is a rapid and reliable test method in higher ranges and is easy to use. We find that it is an effective tool for screening out apheresis platelets with rWBC content in excess of allowable limits. Screening PSPP and WBPC is less efficient due to the frequency of false positives.

The patient's red cells were H-negative and reacted with monoclonal anti-A and anti-A,B but were nonreactive with a human source of anti-A, indicating group A+ w (A h ). The antibody was identified as anti-H. Genetic testing revealed a compound heterozygous FUT1 genotype with two rare mutations, c.349C>T and c.422G>A, and an FUT2 genotype predictive of a nonsecretor status. An allele with the former mutation encodes weak H antigen expression. An allele with the latter mutation encodes no H antigen expression. Thus, genetic testing results were consistent with the para-Bombay phenotype of RBC H-partially deficient, nonsecretor. Treatment of the patient's plasma with 0.01 M DTT, which destroys IgM, eliminated anti-H. The absence of residual reactivity, which would have been due to IgG, suggested low fetal risk. Sources of blood for possible transfusion to the patient were considered. RBCs from the patient's only sibling were group A and incompatible with the patient's plasma. Through autologous collection and the American Rare Donor Program, the patient's blood needs were met and a healthy newborn was delivered. Conclusion: We report a case of a pregnant woman with the para-Bombay phenotype associated with two rare mutations. Provision of RBCs for patients with this phenotype is an ongoing challenge. Early communication between the obstetrician, transfusion service and reference laboratory is essential to optimal transfusion management.IGT99Comparison of Two Methods for 2-Mercaptoethanol Removal from Plasma Specimens Used in Red Cell Antibody Identification Studies Sheri Hugan* and Laura Cooling.

The most common types in Europe and North America are types 1, 2 and 3. In Brazil, although these weak D types are less frequent, they are still considered the most common, followed by weak D type 4.0. Other types of weak Ds are rare and found in distinct populations. To date, only three examples of weak type D type 18 have been reported as part of the Eurasian cluster. Recently we found four unrelated blood donors with weak type D type 18 in Southern Brazil. As very little is known of this RhD variant, we performed a serological and molecular study on the samples of these individuals and their relatives to better characterize this rare phenotype. Study Design/Method: Donor samples showed atypical agglutination reactions in the D typing routine by tube and gel test. Additional serological tests were performed in gel with 12 anti-D clones using the \"Extended Partial RhD Typing Set\" (Bio-Rad). RhCE phenotyping was also performed in the gel. Molecular tests included conventional PCR techniques, RHD BeadChip (Immucor) and genomic DNA sequencing. All donor relatives were requested for the same serological and molecular studies. Results/Finding: DNA sequencing showed the presence of the 19C > T mutation in exon 1 of the RHD gene that leads to the substitution of the amino acid Arginine to a Tryptophan at codon 7 (R7W) of RhD protein, associated with weak D type 18 in the DNA samples of the donors and some of their relatives. Serological tests showed weak expression of D antigen (reactivity < 2+) in tube and mixed-field reaction for RhD phenotype in the gel in all red blood cell (RBC) samples molecularly characterized as RHD*weak D type 18. Positive agglutination results were obtained with the 12 anti-D clones used and the RH haplotype associated with this weak D type was DCe/ce. Conclusion: This is the first serological characterization of the RHD*D weak type 18 showing a mixed field reactivity. All individuals studied shared the RHD*weak D type 18-RHCE*Ce haplotype, confirming previously found in one example of weak D type 18. The presence of this rare variant in four unrelated families suggests a founder effect in this population of Southern Brazil.IGT101 Resolving Blocked Antigen Phenomenon in Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn Due to Anti-K Mitchell Moosavi*, Yao Ma, Alyssa Ziman, Dawn C.

Retrospectively analysis of samples from blood donors given to the 37 patients with irregular antibodies found that all 37 patients had infused red blood cells with incongruent antigens, resulting in ineffective transfusions. Of the 37 patients, 17 were re-transfused, and these patients were given infused red blood cells that did not contain the corresponding antigen. No ineffective blood transfusion occurred. Conclusion: The presence of irregular antibodies that cannot be detected in the blood by conventional detection methods is an important cause of ineffective transfusion. Irregular antibodies are mainly produced by immune stimulation such as blood transfusion or pregnancy, and antibody screening should be performed for patients who have a history of blood transfusions, pregnancy history, and repeated blood transfusion therapy. Some irregular antibodies cannot be detected by routine methods, and the enhancement method of irregular antibody identification should be applied.

The use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) is among the less frequent causes of severe hemolysis, which is mainly caused by the presence of antibodies directed against erythrocyte antigens, especially the ABO system in the immunoglobulin preparations or by passive transfer of alloantibodies present in the blood product. We report a rare case of severe IVIG-induced hemolysis during a treatment of Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Study Design/Method: Female patient, 24 years old, previously healthy, sought the emergency because of paresthesia and symmetrical paresis in the hands and lower limbs with progressive worsening, accompanied by pain of moderate intensity for 5 days. Still, she presented difficulty in walking, facial folding, and horizontal nystagmus when looking to the right, strength 4 in the right hemisphere, proportional hyperreflexia and Glasgow Coma Scale (ECG) of 15 points. Computed tomography (CT) of the skull and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed, both with the absence of acute lesions. The diagnosis of Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, Miller Fisher subtype, was confirmed.

Leininger* 1 , Mollie Bell 2 , David Oh 2 , Matthew Montgomery 2 , Jeffrey Papiernik 2 and Gregory Halverson 2 . 1 Mercy Health -West Hospital, Hoxworth Blood CenterBackground/Case Studies: There is no standard of care method for performing antibody screening on patient and donor samples in the United States. Clearly, it is more economical to employ an automated method of testing because the vast majority of samples will be negative. However, the method used can result in the increased detection of weak, unidentified (UID) antibody reactivity that does not react by the more established methods of antibody identification. (LISS, PEG, Enzymes, IgG Gel Card) Recent publications have shown the Solid Phase (SP) assay is the most sensitive in detecting prophylactic anti-D both immediately after injection and over several months post injection. Others have demonstrated that SP shows an increased sensitivity for UID reactivity, especially in females and those with a diagnosis of cancer or autoimmune disease. Many other factors affect the reactivity of an antibody such as isotype, concentration, antigen density, Fc receptor binding and C1q affinity. The question remains, what is the best method for antibody screening in your laboratory? This abstract presents Reference Laboratory cases where the only method that detected antibody reactivity was SP. Study Design/Method: All methods used in this retrospective study are the published procedures for Solid Phase (SP), IgG Gel (G) card and tube hemagglutination (T) using LISS or PEG and converting to anti-Human IgG (AHG) Results/Finding:Table 1. Shows 16 cases where reactivity was detected only with SP. In 8 cases the patient was pre-natal with identified antibody specificities of anti-C, -E, -Jk(a) or passive anti-D. In the remaining cases, the diagnosis was Warm Auto Immune Hemolytic Anemia (WAIHA) with Warm Auto Antibodies (WAA) that were reactive only by SP. Conclusion: So does this mean we should adopt the SP assay in all clinical laboratories? It is the decision of the laboratory director to determine which method of antibody detection fits best into their clinical laboratory setting. Some may choose to be more conservative and employ the most sensitive methods such as SP and accept the problem that they are more subject to detect UID reactivity. Immunohematology Reference Laboratories use many different methods to detect and analyze samples submitted from hospitals to determine if clinically significant antibodies are present. Historically there are many reports of antibodies detected only by enzymes, gel or SP. This is a small number of cases that, over 3 years, does not indicate the need for us to implement SP testing in order to confirm the results obtained by the hospital blood bank.IGT107Comparison of Flow Cytometry and MASPAT for Use in Platelet Cross-Matching Huijun Zhu* and Ping Lu.

The TT risk was expressed as the risk of transfusing a clinical product derived from an infectious donation given by a returning donor. Risk estimates were performed on a weekly basis. Input parameters were assumed to have a triangular distribution and the simulation was run with 10 5 iterations. Results/Finding: For the 3 countries reporting the highest WNV TT risk during the 2017 transmission season, the peak weekly risk was 1These results demonstrate a very low risk to blood safety in Australia from the 2017 WNV transmission season in EU and neighbouring countries. The estimated risks were so low that no additional risk mitigation strategies, such as the deferral of donors returning from these countries, were required. The model allows for regular estimations of the TT risk in non-endemic countries associated with returning donors and can be readily adapted to specific countries and other transfusion-transmitted pathogens. However, with such low levels of risk it is feasible to monitor reported case numbers of WNF with set trigger points for implementing risk modelling for each country.BBC34Comparative Efficacy of BacT/ALERT and eBDS Methods for Primary Culture of Platelet Products for Prevention of Bacterial Contamination of Platelet Components Swati Srivastava 1,2 , Michael R. Jacobs* 1 and Robert W. Maitta 3 . 1 University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, 2 Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 3 University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Department of Pathology Background/Case Studies: Testing of platelet (PLT) units was mandated from March 2004 and was implemented by primary culture single donor platelet (SDP) collections at that time and later of pre-storage pooled platelets (PSPP). Two FDA-approved methods for primary culture are available -BacT/ALERT and eBDS. As our PLT suppliers used either BacT/ALERT with an 8-10 mL test volume or eBDS with a 3-4 mL test volume since 2007, we were able to compare bacterial contamination and septic transfusion reaction rates between PLT units tested with these two methods. Study Design/Method: PLT units transfused at our institution between Jan 2007 and Dec 2017 were studied. SDP and PSPP units were tested by primary culture by suppliers using BacT/ALERT or eBDS systems. BacT/ ALERT testing (bioMerieux, St Louis, MO) was performed by inoculating 8-10 mL of SDP collections or PSPP units into BacT/ALERT BPA culture bottles at 24-48 h after collection. eBDS (Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, MA) was performed by inoculating 3-4 mL aliquots of SDP collections or PSPP units into eBDS culture pouches at 24-48 h after collection; pouches were incubated at 35 o C for 24 h and oxygen levels in head space then measured using eBDS Oxygen Analyzer. Units released for use if negative by these methods after testing for 24 hours. At-issue culture was performed by obtaining aliquots from all units at time of release for transfusion, with 0.1 mL volumes plated onto blood agar plates. Plates were incubated for up to 48 hours, and specimens yielding bacterial growth were cultured quantitatively. Records of patients receiving contaminated units were reviewed. Contamination and septic transfusion rates were calculated for each method and unit type. Results/Finding: A total of 90,243 PLT units were transfused during the 11 year study period; 40,144 tested by BacT/ALERT (35,188 SDP and 4,957 PSPP) and 50,098 by eBDS(34,898 SDP and 15,200 PSPP). Twenty-six units were found to be bacterially contaminated: 12 tested by BacT/ALERT (10 SDP, 2 PSPP) and 14 (12 SDP, 2 PSPP) by eBDS. Contamination rates (expressed as rates per million PLT units for units tested by BacT/ALERT vs. eBDS) were comparable overall and by PLT unit type: overall 299 vs. 279 (p=0.86); SDP 284 vs. 344 (p=0.65); PSPP 403 vs 132 (p=0.24). Twenty-four contaminated products were transfused and resulted in five septic reactions, one from a unit tested with BacT/ALERT and 4 with eBDS (25 vs. 80 per million, respectively; p=0.27). Conclusion: Despite the difference in volume of PLT tested by the two methods (3-4 mL by eBDS and 8-10 mL by BacT/ ALERT), rates of PLT bacterial contamination and septic reactions to transfusion of contaminated PLT were not significantly different between the PLT tested by the two primary testing methods used. Additional measures are needed to reduce rates of bacterial contamination and septic reactions to bacterially contaminated PLT products.BBC35Amotosalen/UVA Treatment Inactivates Multiple Anaerobes Present in a Single Platelet Concentrate Unit to Sterility after 7 Days of Storage Nidhi Patel 1 , Melissa McCormack 1 and Peter Bringmann* 2 . 1 Cerus Corporation, 2 Microbiology Department, Cerus CorporationBackground/Case Studies: The INTERCEPT\u00ae Blood System for Platelets was developed for the inactivation of a broad range of pathogens and leukocytes in platelet concentrates (PC). The system utilizes amotosalen and UVA light and is approved in the US to treat apheresis platelets in 100% plasma or in 65% PAS with doses ranging from 2.9 to 8.0x10 11 platelets. Despite the implementation of bacterial culture screening unrecognized bacterial contamination may still result in fulminant transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI). In particular, anaerobic bacteria that exhibit a longer lag period or slowly grow under PC storage conditions can be missed by culture based bacterial screening and result in TTI. To evaluate the efficacy of amotosalen-UVA to inactivate bacterial co-contamination by two anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium perfringens (a fast growing anaerobe) and Propionibacterium acnes (a slow growing anaerobe), contaminated PCs were treated with amotosalen-UVA, and stored under PC storage conditions at 22\u02daC for 7 days. Study Design/Method: For each experiment, PCs prepared either in 35% plasma/65% PAS or 100% plasma with a final volume of $280 to 326 mL and a dose of 3.4 to 4.4 \u00d7 10 11 platelets were used. Platelet components were divided in half and each half was spiked with either C. perfringens or P. acnes. Prior to the Amotosalen-UVA treatment, half units with one of each anaerobe were recombined and a sample was taken for plating assay.The co-infected PC was treated with amotosalen and UVA. Samples were taken: pre and post-illumination, post-CAD and after 5 and 7 Days of storage. A Control arm PC was also spiked to confirm the growth and survival of C. perfringens and P. acnes under similar processing (without S-59 and UVA) and PC storage conditions as Test. Results/Finding: C. perfringens (Cp) and P. acnes (Pa) inactivation is summarized below: Conclusion: Amotosalen-UVA reproducibly inactivated multiple anaerobic bacteria in co-contaminated PC to a high level of $6 log CFU/mL resulting in sterility as demonstrated by the absence of detectable bacteria after 7 Days of storage, while the Control arm demonstrated growth/survival of bacteria over the similar processing and storage period.BBC36Donor Characteristics Do Not Influence the Risk for Onset of Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury in a Secondary Analysis of Two Case-Control Studies Emma van de Weerdt* 1,2 , Anna-Linda Peters 2,3 , Femmeke Prinsze 4 , Dirk de Korte 5 , Nicole Juffermans 6 and Alexander Vlaar 1 .1 Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Academic Medical Center, 2 Laboratory of Experimental Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Academic Medical Center, 3 Department of Intensive Care, Medical Center, 4 Department of Donor Studies, Sanquin Research, 5 Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, 6 Laboratory for Experimental Intensive Care and Anesthesiology, Academic Medical Center",

TRALI patients received more products than controls (chisquare test p < 0.0001). There was no relation between TRALI incidence and donor sex (chi square test p > 0.5). Both TRALI patients and transfused controls received mainly products from donors over 41 years old (chi square test p < 0.05), but donor age did not influence TRALI risk (chi square test p > 0.5). Both TRALI and control patients received more blood products from blood type 0 and A (p<0.0001). TRALI was not related to blood group matched or blood type compatible transfusion (fisher-exact test p = 0.41). In the prospective case control study in cardiac surgery patients, 16 patients developed TRALI (75% male, median age 74, IQR 71-79). 32 patients were randomly selected as controls (63% male, median age 69, IQR 62-75). This cohort confirmed the results of retrospective study for donor blood type, donor sex and blood type-compatible and blood type-matched products. In this cohort, both groups received mainly products from males, and TRALI patients did not receive more transfusions.(chi square test p < 0.00001). Conclusion: We conclude that in two cohorts of TRALI patients, donor blood type, donor age, donor sex and the transfusion of blood type-compatible and blood type-matched products were not associated with an increased risk for TRALI.BBC37Measuring Red Blood Cell Deformability Using a Microfluidic Device: Development of an External Standard Based Approach to Reduce Chip-to-Chip Variations Jonathan Robidoux*, Eric Ducas, Audrey Laforce-Lavoie and Danny Brouard. H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9becBackground/Case Studies: An impaired deformability of red blood cells (RBC) can be related to diseases or consequent to red cell concentrate (RCC) storage. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device especially designed to reproduce RBC circulation in blood vessels was recently developed to assess RBC deformability. This single-use device is made of two inlets, two arrays of channels and a unique outlet. Flow rate measurements near the channel outlets correlates with RBC rheological properties. The analytical approach uses an external standard to account for chip-tochip variations. This study aims at validating microbeads as an external standard to monitor RBC deformability during storage. Study Design/Method: A dye-doped carboxyl polystyrene microsphere (d = 1 \u00b1 0.05) solution was used as external standard in this study. The stock solution (DCCR004, BangLabs) was dispersed 1:20 in filtered phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Glycerol was added at 16% to match the average RBC flow rate previously recorded with the same microfluidic device on fresh RBC. Multiple hardware and software parameters were tested for their respective impacts on the performances of the analytical method (i.e. precision, accuracy), measured as the rate of occurrence of plugging events.",

Heidi Krause, Roland Bassett, Tiffany Williams-Lara and Fleur M.

Inadequate dosages limited the usage in the past. The use of mobilizing agents and fully automated devices has improved the yield of the granulocyte concentrate, leading to improved clinical outcomes. It has now been established that the dose of transfused granulocyte is one of the most important predictors for the success of granulocyte transfusions. Study Design/Method: Clinical data from January 2017 to February 2018 of 96 first time consecutive female donors who were relatives and friends of patients was collected. BMI was calculated of the donors and the donors were categorized into three groups, normal BMI < 25, BMI 25 -<30 (overweight) and BMI > 30 (obese).The goal of the study was to see whether there was a correlation with increased BMI in the first time female donors with a greater increase in WBC after mobilization with G-CSF (Filgrastim [Neupogen]) plus dexamethasone.

Ongoing monitoring of HIV-1 molecular diversity in blood donors is an important component of a comprehensive surveillance system. We studied HIV-1 subtype distribution and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in HIV-1 infected blood donors from five Chinese regions. Study Design/Method: HIV-1 Western-Blot (WB) confirmed blood samples were collected from five blood centers from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016. The HIV Pol regions were sequenced to reconstruct phylogeny. The subtypes and the DRMs of each sequence were analyzed using previous published methods.Results/Finding: 119 sequences were successfully obtained from 217 HIV-1 infected donors. Subtype distribution is as the following: circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC (67.2%), CRF08_BC (7.6%), CRF01_AE (19.3%), B (2.5%), and CRF55_01B (2.5%). The predominant subtype in each blood center varied. 20 samples had DRMs, yielding a drug resistance prevalence of 16.8% (20/119). 24 DRMs were identified including 2 protease inhibitors (PIs) accessory DRMs (Q58E and V32E), 2 PIs major DRMs (M46L), 8 nucleoside RT inhibitors DRMs (F116Y, D67N, K70N and M184L), and 12 no nucleoside RT inhibitors DRMs (V179E, K103N, Y188D, E138A, L100F, L100P) (Table 1). Conclusion: The subtype distribution of HIV-1 in Chinese donors continues to show abundant diversity. Compared to previous results, the formerly predominant subtype B continues to decrease. This is the first report of subtype CRF_5501B in an infected donor. CRF_5501B is a newly identified subtype which has been associated with men who have sex with men (MSM). Our findings are consistent with the shift of predominant mode of HIV transmission from illegal drug injection to sexual transmission (including MSM transmission) observed in the general Chinese population. The DRMs prevalence increased from 13.2% (27/205, 2012-2014 data from the same blood centers) to 16.8% (20/119). While a limitation of this study is the relatively low amplification rate (54.8%, 119/217), our results support the need for continued molecular surveillance in donors. Better understanding of HIV risk factors will be important to further improve blood safety.BBC40Iron.Scan -Point-of-Donation Iron Deficiency Screening Li Jiang* and Dakota O'Dell. VitaScanBackground/Case Studies: Iron depletion poses a significant health risk to blood donors, yet as much as 50% of the blood collected is from donors who are already iron deficient. Donor screening includes testing hemoglobin, which is the best available rapid test that serves as a proxy for iron status, but is in fact a poor predictor of actual iron stores. Many low iron donors are thus further depleted by their donations. This problem has been recognized by the FDA and the AABB, who have pushed for new protocols to reduce the risk to donors. Serum ferritin is considered to be one of the best indicators of iron stores, but due to technology limitations can only be tested using laboratory machines, which are slow, expensive, and impractical for use as a screening test within the existing blood donation workflow. VitaScan has developed Iron.Scan, a rapid diagnostic test for quantitative assessment of ferritin in minutes from a finger stick of blood. Here we demonstrate its accuracy compared to the IMMULITE 2000 FERRITIN assay. Study Design/Method: A test for ferritin was developed as a lateral flow immunassay. Colorimetric lines develop on the assay as a function of ferritin protein concentration, which are analyzed by our optical reader to calculate a ferritin value. This was tested on 55 serum samples and 40 whole blood samples, and we compare linear correlation and agreement against the IMMULITE 2000 FERRITIN laboratory assay. Results/Finding: Serum and blood samples demonstrated strong correlation (R 2 = 0.95 and R 2 = 0.91, respectively). Using the HEIRS study designated cut-off of 26 ng/mL to define iron deficiency, we also demonstrate 93.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity for serum and 87.5% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity for blood.",

Abel. American Red Cross Holland Lab Background/Case Studies: Bacterial contamination of platelets may lead to septic events when organisms grow undetected by culture during platelet storage. An organism's growth might be influenced by the milieu in which platelets are suspended. This study evaluated the growth of 11 bacterial species that have been implicated in septic events in platelet additive solution (PAS) platelets or have been characterized as slower growers or exhibiting lag times in platelets. Study Design/Method: A hyperconcentrated double unit of aphersis platelets with a targeted yield of 7.2 \u00d7 10 11 and concurrent plasma were collected on the Amicus from a normal, consenting donor. The hyperconcentrated unit was divided equally into two aliquots. To one aliquot, PAS-3 was added to yield 35% plasma/65% PAS-3. To the other aliquot, an equivalent volume plasma that was used for preparing PAS-3 platelets was added. Following 1-hour resting and 1-hour agitation, aliquots were immediately split into 60 mL sub-aliquots in CLX containers and inoculated with 10-100 CFU/mL, for purposes of quantitative plate assay, with fresh overnight cultures of bacterial isolates including: S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, S. caprae, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, S. gallolyticus, S. warneri, and B. cereus. Platelet sub-aliquots were stored at 20-24\u02daC with agitation. Samples were obtained daily for quantitative plate culture (in duplicate) during 5-day storage. Depending on the organism, experiments were repeated 4-6 times. Results/Finding: S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, S. gallolyticus, S. warneri, and B. cereus had similar growth kinetics in PAS-3 and plasma (p>0.05). On Day 4, S epidermidis and S. gallolyticus had a trend (0.05<p<0.10) towards slightly greater or lesser growth, respectively, in plasma compared to PAS. A baumannii (days 1-3) and S caprae (days 4,5) had significantly greater growth in PAS compared to plasma (p<0.05). Conclusion: Nine of 11 organisms exhibited similar growth kinetics in platelets suspended in PAS compared to plasma. Two organisms displayed significantly faster early or late growth in PAS.BBC42Red Cell Alloantibody Evanescence in Blood Donors Jessica S.

A new nucleic acid test, the UltraQual \u00ae Multiplex PCR Assay (multiplex assay), was recently developed for simultaneously screening pooled source plasma donations for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), HIV-1, and HIV-2. Currently this new test is under review for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Study Design/Method: Over a six-month period, a total of 1,534,648 individual donations from 161,037 different donors from 54 donor centers were tested in 3,000 master pools containing up to 512 donations each. An FDAapproved pooling and testing algorithm was used for pooling aliquots of individual plasma donations and subsequently identifying any positive donations. Plasma pools were tested in parallel with the multiplex assay and the individual, FDA-approved UltraQual \u00ae HCV, UltraQual \u00ae HIV-1, and UltraQual \u00ae HBV Assays. Clinical specificities and sensitivities of the multiplex assay and the FDA-licensed assays were compared using McNemar's Test for matched pairs (p value). Results/Finding: There were 1,534,341 donations confirmed negative for HCV, HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV and 307 donations confirmed positive for at least one target virus. Both assays demonstrated clinical specificities of 100% when testing each target virus. Both the number of donations confirmed positive for a viral type and the calculated clinical sensitivities for both assay types are listed in the following table. Conclusion: The multiplex assay and the FDA-licensed assays showed similar clinical sensitivities (with p values > 0.05) when detecting HIV-1 and HBV. However, the two assay results were statistically different for HCV detection, indicating that the multiplex assay is superior to the FDA-licensed UltraQual\u00ae Assay at detecting HCV RNA. The difference in the HCV results can be explained, at least in part, by the dramatically improved analytical sensitivity (1.72 IU/mL versus 6.61 IU/mL) of the multiplex assay. Overall the UltraQual \u00ae Multiplex PCR Assay has demonstrated equivalence or superiority (in the case of HCV) when compared to the FDA-approved, individual UltraQual \u00ae HCV, HBV, and HIV-1 Assays.BBC44Prevalence and 9 Years-Incidence of HEV Infection in Italian Blood Donors: An Estimate of Transfusion Risk Marta Spreafico* 1 , Livia Raffaele 1 , Irene Guarnori 1 , Barbara Foglieni 1 , Alessandra Berzuini 1 and Daniele Prati 2 . 1 Department of Transfusion Medicine and Hematology, Ospedale Alessandro Manzoni, 2 Immunohematology Reference Laboratory, Department of Transfusion Medicine and Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Background/Case Studies: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide, and a possible threat to transfusion safety.

In addition, we used these data to estimate risk of transfusion transmission. Study Design/Method: The study was conducted within BOTIA, an EUfinanced repository of donor-recipient pairs. For the viremia study, nearly 10,000 samples were collected from anonymized donations in 2016. Samples were tested by individual-donation nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) for HEV RNA using the Procleix HEV assay (95% limit of detection 7.9 IU/mL). For the serology study, a subset of 2000 donations was tested for HEV IgG using DiaPro HEV ELISA kit(Diagnostic Bioprobes Srl, Milano,  Italy). HEV IgG and IgM were analyzed in ID-NAT positive samples at the time of donation and one year after the index donation. Furthermore, for the incidence study, 320 repeat donors for whom serial samples were available in the BOTIA biorepository was analyzed over a period of 8 to 10 years. The risk of receiving an infectious blood unit was estimated according to two different methods: the HEV RNA yield and the serological incidence data, assuming a duration of viremia of 30 days in seroconverting donors. Results/Finding: Nine out of 9,726 donor samples showed HEV RNA reactivity. Of them, one sample was confirmed to be reactive in repeated TMA tests and showed IgM and IgG seroconversion, indicating a primary HEV infection. Thus, the HEV RNA prevalence was 0.01% (95% CI: 0-0.06%). In the seroprevalence study, the proportion of confirmed anti-HEV IgG reactivity was 148/2000 (7.4%, 95% CI: 6.3-8.6). The incidence study(2007-2017,  median 9 years)  showed that 2 of 289 donors anti-HEV-IgG negative at baseline seroconverted (0.69%). The incidence was 7.6/10,000 personyears (95% CI: 2.5). The estimate of transfusion risk using HEV RNA yield was 1 per 10,000 blood donations (upper bound of the 95% CI: 1:1,666); using the incidence data was of 1 per 16,666 blood donations; (95% CI: 1:4350 -1:57,000). Conclusion: Our results does not suggest hyperendemicity of HEV among the blood donors of our geographic area as compared to other European countries. The estimate of the transfusion risks gave coincident results using two independent approaches (HEV RNA yield and sero-incidence in donors); the average risk is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 20,000 blood donations. This also suggests that the risk of acquiring (and therefore transmitting) the infection remained substantially stable over the past decade.BBC45Exploring the Potential Harm of Short-Term Blood Storage on Patients Undergoing Cardiovascular Surgery Shuoyan Ning* 1 , Yang Liu 2 , Na Li 2 , Rebecca Barty 2 , Jason P.

DeGroote School of Medicine, McMaster University, 2 McMaster Centre for Transfusion Research, 3 Centre for Innovation, Canadian Blood Services, 4 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, 5 University of Waterloo, 6 Canadian Blood ServicesBackground/Case Studies: The safety of long-term blood storage has recently been affirmed through multiple randomized trials. However, questions around potential harms of short-term stored red blood cells (RBC) have been raised. Cardiac surgery patients may be especially vulnerable to harm due to high rates of transfusion and the inflammatory state occurring with bypass. This study examined the association between in-hospital mortality and exposure to short-term stored RBCs in the cardiac surgery patient population. Study Design/Method: Adult (\u226518 years) in-patients who received at least 1 RBC transfusion in the context of cardiac surgery from 2002-2017 were identified in an academic centre. To assess the effect of short-term RBC storage on in-hospital mortality, Cox proportional hazards models were fitted. Patient exposure was defined as transfusions with RBCs of shortest storage duration and was analysed as: a continuous variable; by quartiles; by weeks of storage; and a 3 category model(1-7days, 8-35days, 36-42 days). Reference group was exclusive exposure to RBCs stored for the longest duration for all models. Timedependent (hemoglobin, creatinine, platelet/plasma/cryoprecipitate transfusion, ABO identical RBC transfusions) and time-independent covariates (age, sex, ABO blood group, admission year, comorbidities) were adjusted for in the analyses. All models met the Cox proportional hazards assumption.Results/Finding: From 2002,421 patients received 53,815 RBC transfusions. Median patient age was 71 (IQR 63-78) and 38.6% of patients were female. Median number of RBC units transfused was 3 (IQR 2-5), and median unit age was 20 days. Overall in-hospital mortality was 5.4%. Hazard Ratio (HR) for the continuous analysis was 1.004 (95% CI 0.998-1.019, p = 0.645) for every 1-day decrease in blood storage. The model using weeks of storage showed no significant differences when the reference group (exclusive exposure to RBCs stored 36-42 days) was compared to exposure to RBCs stored for 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks(Table 1). Similar findings were obtained for all other models (data not shown). Conclusion: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, an association between in-hospital mortality and exposure to short-term stored RBCs was not found regardless of whether exposure was analysed as a continuous variable or by categories of storage duration.BBC46 In Vitro Function of Amotosalen/UVA Treated Platelets in PAS-3 Using Triple Storage Processing Set Danielle Badgley 1 , Cheryl Heber 1 , Jeanne Cunningham 1 , Lisa Minogue 1 , Amanda Timson 1 , Hermelinda Evans 2 , Anna Erickson 2 and Fatbardha Varfaj* 2 . 1 Fresenius-Kabi USA, LLC, 2 Cerus CorporationBackground/Case Studies: The INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets Triple Storage (TS) processing set is CE mark approved for pathogen reduction of platelets in platelet additive solution (PAS), and is not currently FDA approved. The system utilizes amotosalen, with UVA light to inactivate pathogens and leukocytes. This study evaluated in vitro function of INTERCEPT PCs prepared using the TS set and over 7 days of storage. Study Design/Method: Amicus apheresis PCs were collected in PAS-3 (65% PAS-3/35% plasma). Inputs from 3 triple-dose collections and 3 pools from two ABO-matched collections containing doses of 9.1-9.8x10 11 platelets with counts of 1.5-1.6x10 9 /mL in 611-628 mL, were treated using the INTERCEPT TS set (Test). Untreated Control triple dose collections had doses of 10.3-10.5x10 11 with counts of 1.5-1.6x10 9 /mL in 573-625 mL. All PCs were stored at 22-24\u00b0C up to 7 days and assessed for in vitro physical/metabolic characteristics on Days 5 and 7. Results/Finding: Following treatment, the platelet dose recovery was \u226587% (91 \u00b1 3%) and PCs contained doses of \u22654.1 (4.4 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 11 per component. All treated PCs met the FDA requirements of pH\u22656.2 at Days 5 and 7. in vitro platelet quality at Days 5 and 7 post-donation was comparable to unpaired untreated Control PCs(Table 1). Conclusion: Triple-dose and pooled Amicus PCs in PAS-3 treated with the INTERCEPT TS set and stored up to 7 days retained in vitro metabolic and functional properties consistent with ranges for untreated Control PC and in vivo functionality.",

            "text": "HR from Cox regression model where exposure (RBC with the shortest storage duration) was categorized by weeks of storage time when the number of cases in general population was still increasing. Thirteen HAV-infected donors were detected in 2017 (vs 2 in 2015 and 3 in 2016). All 18 donors were confirmed asymptomatic at time of blood donation. Genotype IA MSM outbreak-associated strains were identified in 12 of the 13 cases detected in 2017. Viral loads in HAV positive donors (2015 to 2017) ranged from 1.2 to 8.59 log10 IU/mL and did not differ significantly between 2015-2016 and 2017. Despite a higher male to female ratio (5,5 vs 0,7 before 2017) and the identification of MSM-associated outbreak strains, only 1/11 infected male donors in 2017 self-reported as MSM. Other HAV risk factors (food or professional exposure mainly) were identified in 6 (5 males, 1 female) of the 12 evaluable donors in 2017 while no risk factors were identified for the remaining 5 donors (4 males, 1 female). Similar food or professional exposure risk factors were identified in 4 of the 5 blood donors identified in 2015 and 2016 (while none was found for the last case). Involved red blood cell concentrates were destroyed (n=9) if not already transfused (n=3). Platelet concentrates (n=9) were transfused before results were made available. All collected plasma were destroyed (n=17). Haemovigilance enquiry of HAV-RNA positive blood transfusions (n=12) revealed one case of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis A in 2017, confirmed by molecular comparison of donor and recipient viral strains. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the risk of collecting HAV-infected blood donations during hepatitis A outbreaks. During the 2017 HAV outbreak in France, the risk of collecting asymptomatic blood donors was increased while remaining a rare event. Nevertheless, at least one transfusion-transmitted hepatitis A occurred.BBC49An Example of Prozone Using Solid Phase Platelet Crossmatch Technique Cami Melland*, Connie Hintz and Samantha Mack. Blood Systems Mountain DivisionBackground/Case Studies: Platelet crossmatch solid phase testing is utilized when a patient demonstrates platelet refractoriness. The methodology detects incompatibility between patient plasma and donor platelets due to the presence of platelet, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and/or ABO antibodies. Platelet crossmatch technique should show compatibility with platelets lacking the antigen to which the patient has antibodies. This case demonstrates patient antibodies not detected by platelet crossmatch testing. Study Design/Method: The regional Immunohematology Reference Lab (IRL) received the patient sample request for platelet crossmatch and obtained 100% compatibility. The patient sample was also sent out for panel reactive antibodies (PRA) to detect HLA antibodies. PRA results are reported using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and while the result is not equal to a quantitative titer result, it is semi-quantitative. The PRA results showed 97% reactivity and MFI results up to approximately 17,000 which should have caused incompatible platelet crossmatch test results.",

Walensky 2 .1  Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, 2 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital Background/Case Studies: Due to risk of HIV transmission, the Food and Drug Administration recommends a ban on blood donation from men who have sex with men (MSM). Revised in 2015, the current donation restriction is limited to men who have had sex with a man in the past year. In light of advances in HIV screening, this ban may not represent the optimal strategy for ensuring a safe blood supply. Study Design/Method: Using a decision tree, we compared 3 strategies to screen the blood supply and its donors: 1) the current standard: a deferral for MSM followed by 4 th generation HIV Ab/Ag and viral load (VL) testing of all donated units; 2) test-only: no deferral, with 4 th generation Ab/Ag and VL testing of all donated units; 3) risk-based: deferral for all male donors who have had condomless anal intercourse in the past month, followed by 4 th generation Ab/Ag and VL testing of all donated units. The primary outcome was the expected number of accepted HIV + donations per million units of donated blood. Key model input parameters include MSM prevalence (3.6%), HIV testing sensitivity for chronic (99.6%) and acute (75.0%) infection, and false negative rate of both the current MSM deferral question and the risk-based screening question (2.6% for each). In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the impact of variation in these parameters. Results/Finding: In the base case, the current strategy resulted in 4.90 HIV + accepted blood donations per million; the testing only strategy resulted in 6.28 HIV + accepted blood donations per million; and the riskbased strategy resulted in the lowest risk, with 4.05 HIV + accepted blood donations per million. In sensitivity analyses, the risk-based strategy was superior across plausible ranges of HIV test sensitivity, for both acute and chronic HIV infection. The risk-based strategy remained superior as long as MSM prevalence is less than 6.7%; at higher MSM prevalence, the current strategy was superior. The effectiveness of the screening questions (i.e. the false negative rate for both the current MSM deferral question and the riskbased screening question) contributed the most uncertainty to the model. Compared with the current standard, a risk-based strategy could add 5 million low-risk MSM to the potential donor supply. Conclusion: A risk-based screening question, combined with universal 4 th generation HIV Ab/Ag and viral load testing, may be more effective than the current strategy that includes a 12-month deferral on donations from MSM. The quality and ability of screening questions to accurately assess risk is key to any pre-donation screening strategy.BBC51The Effect of Special Iron Information for Teenage Donors on Deferral Rates and Recruitment Success Rebecca Haley*, Jessica Lantz, Kimberley Cotten, James AuBuchon and YanYun Wu. Bloodworks Northwest Background/Case Studies: Blood donors are invited to begin their donation career during the last half of their teen years. The hoped for effect is that the young donors will absorb a sense of responsibility for the community blood supply. Recent donor studies have pointed out that the young donors may need additional information and encouragement to protect their iron stores. Teen donors tend to have less stored iron than older donors. Our blood center wished to supply information to these donors to help them become aware of this and maintain their iron stores. The questions raised in this sharing of information were: 1) Will the iron physiology information encourage or discourage donation, and 2) Will the percentage of donors with qualifying hematocrits be affected? Study Design/Method: Age appropriate materials explaining the importance of maintaining a healthy stored iron balance in their bodies were developed for the teenagers for the school year of 2017-18 (FY 18). Printed materials described the body's need for iron, the possible effects of blood donation on iron stores and suggested steps to maintain iron balance. Materials were sent to each high school where blood drives were planned, and also sent to the homes of potential donors addresses to the donor's parents along with information about the blood drive and a consent form to be signed where consent was required. A special letter was sent to the parents in this package explaining the importance of iron nutrition for teenagers and their nutritional needs. Iron supplements were offered at nearby collection centers if donors with consent wished to pick them up. The older teenagers did not require letters to their parents and only saw the iron information on the day of donation. The iron information was distributed again to all donors at the time of the blood drive. The numbers of donors presenting and the number qualifying by hematocrit from the first 6 months of the school year, September -February, FY 18 were compared with the same time in the previous year, FY 17. Results/Finding: Conclusion: More female than male donors volunteer for blood donation in the young donors evaluated in these young donor groups. Provision of information on the importance of iron physiology and the need for adequate iron stores and other donor promotion encouragement gave a 6.6% increase in donors volunteering in this time period of fiscal year FY 18 over FY 17. The explanation of the possible deleterious effects of blood donation and suggestions on how to mitigate those effects appeared to increase, and not decrease younger donor participation. The older group's gains in qualification were more modest. The numbers of 16-17 YO female donors increased 16.5%, while qualifying female donors in the group increased 3.3%over the previous year's same age group. Provision of iron nutritional information to teenagers and their parents was associated with increased numbers of young donors volunteering. More of the donors presenting also qualified for donation. This improvement was greatest in 16 -17 YO female donors.BBC52Safety Analysis of Long-Term Moderate Intensity Plasmapheresis Donation in Australia James Thyer*, Barbara Bell and Stephen Wright. Australian Red Cross Blood Service Background/Case Studies: Australia is facing an increasing demand for plasma-derived intravenous immunoglobulin, necessitating not only the recruitment of whole blood donors to plasma donation, but also to increasing donation frequency within the regulated limit of 26 plasma donations per year. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service database contains comprehensive donor demographic, donation and testing results from 2007 to the present. All first-time plasma donors require total protein (TP), albumin, IgG, IgM and IgA testing; all donors undergo subsequent annual measurement of TP, albumin, IgG and haematological markers. We used these data to evaluate the impact of plasmapheresis at different intensities on donor health using biochemical and haematological markers, and donor deferral information. Study Design/Method: Records were extracted for all donors who had made a plasma donation between January 2007 and end December 2016. Records were retrieved for 328,896 donors, who had made at least one plasma donation over 10 years. The effect of prior mixed donation count and donor age on IgG, IgA and IgM at the first electronically captured donor review was examined. Approximately 6 million donation records were collected, with analysis of yearly measurement of IgG, TP, albumin and haemoglobin, platelet and differential white cell count. Reasons for permanent deferral in the plasma donation panel are discussed. Results/Finding: Increasing donor age and increasing number of previous donations were associated with a small decrease in mean IgG and TP levels, however no effect was observed on IgA, IgM or albumin levels for first-time plasma donors. Over the ten-year period, donors showed a small decline in mean IgG levels of 5.7%. The highest donation frequency was associated with mean IgG levels 10.0% lower than for donors with the lowest donation frequency. These effects were greater in females than males. Changes in both albumin and TP were minimal and were not affected by higher donation frequency. Plasma donation had no effect on platelets, lymphocytes, neutrophils or eosinophils, regardless of donation frequency or donation mix. Haemoglobin levels increased slightly with time and plasma donation frequency. The most common reason for permanent deferral of plasma donors was for cardiovascular reasons (32%) at mean age 58.3 years, range 20-80, followed by donor reactions (28%) at mean age 46.7 years, range 18-80, and non-malignant clonal disorders (13%) at mean age 54.3 years, range 20-79. Conclusion: Review of routine annual biochemical and haematological data from plasma donors, suggests that long-term plasmapheresis up to 26 times per year is safe for donors.BBC53Enhanced Detection of Very Low Viral Loads Using Replicate Testing on a Fully Automated Nucleic Acid Amplification System Sonia Bakkour* 1 , Mars Stone 1 , Xutao Deng 1 , Scott Hauenstein 2 , Andrew Worlock 2 , Kui Gao 3 , Jeffrey M.

Plasma from 26 HIV elite controllers (ECs) had detectable HIV in 24/26 (92%) individuals, with a median of 7.5/18 reps detected. Plasma collected from 50 ART-suppressed HIVinfected individuals with consistently negative standard VL assay results had detectable HIV in 45/50 (90%) individuals at study entry using the replicate testing approach, with a median of 7/45 reps detected. Plasma from 53 ZIKV-infected blood donors had detectable ZIKV in 29/53 (55%) individuals at study entry (median of 9 days post-index donation) using the replicate testing approach, with a median of 1/8 reps detected. Lysed WB was available from 47 of these blood donors at study entry, where ZIKV was detectable in 41/47 (87%) individuals, with a median of 2/2 reps detected. Conclusion: Replicate testing is easily performed on the Panther platform and provides substantially lower LODs and enhanced detection of very low level viral RNA in samples from blood donors and clinical cases. These findings document HIV RNA in a high proportion of ECs and ART-suppressed patients, and extended detection of ZIKV RNA in plasma and WB from ZIKV infected donors.BBC54GPIb\u03b1 Shedding Is a Consequence of Damage to Cryopreserved Platelets, Not a Cause Katrijn R.

Warbington, M. Schott, G. Villegas, Nina Mufti and Anna Erickson*.Cerus CorporationBackground/Case Studies: A pathogen reduction (PR) system using amustaline and glutathione (GSH) is being developed for the inactivation of pathogens and leukocytes in red blood cell (RBC) components. Amustaline forms adducts with nucleic acids and inhibits replication of contaminating pathogens and leukocytes. Although leukocytes are effectively inactivated in PR RBCs, during clinical trials institutional practices may require irradiation (IR) of PR at some sites. This study characterized the in vitro function of PR and Control RBCs with and without IR on Day (D) 7 or D21 post donation and throughout 28-35 days of storage. Study Design/Method: Leukocyte reduced AS-5 RBCs were prepared from CPD whole blood collections within 24 hours of donation. For each replicate (n=6), ABO matched AS-5 RBC were pooled and divided into 3 Test (T) input components and 3 Control (C) components. Test input RBCs were treated with 20 mM GSH/0.2 mM amustaline while C components were untreated and stored at 2-6\u00b0C. On D7 and D21 post donation 1 T and 1 C component from each replicate were IR (IR-T and IR-C). Sampling for analysis of in vitro parameters was performed throughout storage. Results/Finding: On D2, all components contained \u226540g hemoglobin and had 50-70% hematocrit. On D35, T, compared to C, exhibited lower hemolysis, reduced extracellular K+, increased ATP levels and pH conserved pH and other physiologic functions. On D35, D21 IR-T had reduced hemolysis, pH, post rejuvenation 2,3-DPG, post rejuvenation oxygen dissociation and RBC deformability compared to D21 IR-C; however, all parameters remained within functional physiologic ranges(Table 1). Conclusion: Although IR is not expected to be required in routine use of amustaline-GSH RBC after licensure, this study demonstrated the robustness of PR treatment when combined with IR. All measured in vitro parameters of INTERCEPT treated RBCs, including ATP and glucose levels, were conserved within physiologic functional ranges.BBC60Winter Is Coming!

This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the DHHS; ASPR; BARDA; Contract No. HHSO100201600009CBackground/Case Studies: The Full-Length Donor Questionnaire (DHQ) was developed to streamline the donor process, with questions grouped by timeframe to optimize donor recall. Donor pregnancy status has continued to be included in the DHQ through numerous revisions. The recent DHQ modification changed the focus of the question from pregnancy within the last 6 weeks to lifetime pregnancy, thus changing its placement within the DHQ. This evaluation assessed whether the placement of the question impacted the response from donors. Study Design/Method: Every blood donor that presents completes the DHQ electronically. On 7/12/2014, the 7 th question of the DHQ determined if the donor was currently pregnant or had been pregnant within the last 6 weeks. Female donors answering no to this question were then asked if she had ever been pregnant as a follow-up question. On 5/22/2016, the pregnancy question was relocated to the 32 nd question and was modified to ask if the donor had ever been pregnant. Responses were gathered for each timeframe and the first date the donor indicated pregnancy was determined. This date was compared with each DHQ to determine if there were any inconsistencies in responses. Generalized estimating equations with dependent variable of pregnancy question answered correctly (0=no, 1=yes) and independent variable of DHQ group as the independent variable assesses the rate at which the question is answered incorrectly, after adjusting for multiple responses per donor ( < 36% of unique donors provided only 1 response). Statistical significance was defined as p-value < 0.05. Results/Finding: The data showed that from 7/12/2014 to 5/21/2016, 1.6% of females that had indicated pregnancy on a previous DHQ did not correctly answer the pregnancy question on subsequent DHQs. From 5/22/2016 to 3/15/2018, following the relocation of the pregnancy question, 3.2% of females that had indicated pregnancy on a previous DHQ did not recognize pregnancy history on subsequent DHQs. Conclusion: The position of a question on the DHQ could be a factor in the accuracy of donor responses, with the data showing a greater likelihood of an inaccurate response when the question was moved from the beginning to a later position on the DHQ. A potential solution is to order the questions on the DHQ by seriousness of risk to donor/recipient rather than by timeframe, thereby improving the likelihood of accurate responses to the most critical questions. Enhancing computer support to highlight donor responses that are answered inconsistently between visits would also aid in identifying discrepancies that could then be reconciled with the donor.BBC67Prevalence of Non-ABO RBC Alloantibodies in Blood Donors Monika Paroder* 1,2 , Anna Birbraer 2 , Shiraz Rehmani 2 , Bruce S. Sachais 2 and Connie M. Westhoff 3 . 1 Columbia University Medical Center, 2 New York Blood Center, 3 Immunohematology and Genomics Laboratory, New York Blood CenterBackground/Case Studies: The prevalence of RBC alloimmunization has been reported in blood recipients but little data exists on the prevalence of alloimmunization to RBC antigens in healthy donors. Positive antibody (Ab) screens in blood donors often lead to donor deferrals, because although the plasma volume remaining on RBC units is minimal, the unit must be labeled with the Ab specificity which causes operational challenges for the blood center and hospitals. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence and specificities of non-ABO alloantibodies in our blood donors over an 18 year period and quantify antibodies by gender, age and race. Study Design/Method: Dates of blood donation and corresponding Ab screen/ID results, gender, ethnicity, and age, were obtained from collection center records between 1999 and 2017. To determine the overall prevalence of alloimmunization to RBC antigens in our donor pool, we searched donor records to identify those with at least one positive Ab screen. Results/Finding: During the 18 year period, Ab screens were performed on 1,500,756 donors; 734,723 (49%) females and 766,031 (51%) males. A total of 4,963 donors (0.33%) had \u2265 1 positive Ab screen with Ab ID on record constituting 0.512% of all female and 0.16% of all male donors tested. The most frequent Ab ID was \"non-specific,\" accounting for 31.2% of female and 44.9% of male positive Ab screens. The most common specificity identified was anti-D, detected in 1196 (0.08%) of all donors screened and in 24.1% of the donors with identifiable specificities, with 3 female donors being Rh posi-0% respectively, of donors with positive Ab screens and ID on record. Anti-D was the most common Ab in females with positive screens (28.8% vs 9.26% of males with positive screens). Anti-D (n=1085) accounted for 10.9% of Asian, 23.6% of African American, 21.7% of Hispanic, 18.3% of Multiracial, and 31.4% of White female donors with positive screens. The most common Ab specificity in males was anti-K, representing 18% of specific Abs identified in males. The frequency of both anti-D and anti-K increased with age, with 0.017% and 0.003% positive donors, respectively, in the 18-24 age group, compared to 0.63% and 0.22% in the > 74 age group. Conclusion: The prevalence of positive RBC Ab screen in blood donors at our blood center is $0.33%, and as expected, is 3 times more likely in female donors, and 4 more likely female donors >74 years. Anti-D was identified in both males and females, implicating pregnancy and transfusion-related exposures. The presence of anti-D in 1,085 healthy female donors post introduction of RhIg in the 1960's indicates anti-D in pregnancy has not been eliminated.BBC68 Sensitivity Evaluation of the Verax PGDprime\u00ae Test for Bacteria in Platelets David LaVerda*, Lisa Shinefeld, Erica Boudreau, Nancy Best, Miranda Williams, Adam Lousararian, Brandi Salls, Nancy Staecker, Nicholas McKenzie and Remo Vallejo.

Previous studies on extended storage of thawed cryoprecipitate (TCP) have been performed for only up to 5 days. Study Design/Method: The aim of our study was to determine the stability of fibrinogen (Fb) and feasibility of prolonged (>5 days) storage of TCP at room temperature (RT) and refrigerated (Rf ) at 1-6\u00b0C up to 25 days. A total of 10 single units of type O CP were thawed in at 37\u00b0C. 3 TCP were then stored undisturbed at either room temp (n=3) or refrigerated (n=7) for up to 25 days respectively. Fb of TCP was measured at a 5 to 7 dayintervals. Results/Finding: Prolonged storage of TCP at RT showed that Fb was acceptable for up to 25 days. The average calculated amount of Fb after 25 days of RT storage remained stable at 227 mg per unit (178-277 mg), which is \u2265 150 mg per AABB standards. Of note, average labile Factor VIII activity was 32 IU (16-44 IU) below FDA requirement of \u226580 IU. In contrast, Rf storage showed that up to 73% of Fb could be lost by Day 7 due to precipitation which was not observed with the RT units. The precipitate did not disappear by warming the CP. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that prolonged Rf storage of TCP is not practical as precipitation not only led to poor recovery of Fb but also made safe transfusion of the product difficult. On the other hand, RT storage of TCP proved to be an effective method to maintain adequate Fb for up to 25 days. RT TCP can be a novel and enhanced means of providing Fb replacement with a superior turnaround time while limiting wastage.BBC70 Effect of Air Presence during Compound Adsorption on the Quality of Pathogen Reduced Platelet Concentrates Treated By Amotosalen and Ultraviolet Light A Herve Isola*, Arnaud Dupuis, Beatrice Belcour and Christian Gachet. EFS Grand EST Background/Case Studies: Since 2006, EFS Grand Est produces and delivers pathogen reduced Platelet Concentrates (PR-PC) using a photochemical treatment (PCT) combining amotosalen and ultraviolet light A (UVA) (INTERCEPT\u2122, Cerus). After UVA treatment, amotosalen isadsorbed by a compound adsorption device (CAD) during incubation time of 6h to 16h under agitation (Large Volume sets) to be \u2264 2 \u03bcM which is the limit specified by the French regulatory authority. Aims of study is to evaluate the quality of PR-PC processed with or without presence of residual air during the CAD step (the air can be removed with a manual operation). Study Design/Method: Two buffy coat PC (BCPC) from 5 donors were pooled and split to obtain two identical BCPCs: BCPC1 was treated for PR with a 16h CAD time after removing the air in the bag (Control), BCPC2 was treated for PR with a 16h CAD time in presence of residual air in the bag (Test). Biological parameters (swirling, platelet content, residual leukocytes, pH, pO 2 , pCO 2 , lactate, Glucose, LDH, soluble p-selectin) and residual amotosalen concentration were assessed. Results/Finding: the mean platelet contents were 4.2 \u00b1 0.3.10 11 for Control and Test before PCT and respectively 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 11 and 3.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10 11 after PCT. All the units presented maximum swirling and compliant pH. Residual amotosalen concentration was < 2 \u03bcM for each unit of PC. Evolution of biological parameters during storage period was similar for Control and Test(Table 1) except for pO 2 at day 2, due to air presence in Test PCs. Conclusion: The quality control of PR-BCPCs showed no difference when the CAD operation was performed with or without the presence of residual air in the bag. The quality of PR-PCs was preserved. This study allows to simplifying the PRT process of PCT by eliminating the manual operation of air removal before CAD operation. Thus, it contributes to reduce time process, variability and loss of platelet content.BBC71Additive Solution Diverted Plasma Does Not Cause More Transfusion Reactions Jason Kang*, Jessica Mallek, Catherine Saporito, Gregory Wright and James T.

However, the incidence of transfusion reactions from the diverted plasma has not been widely reported. Plasma and platelet transfusion reaction data from a multi-hospital, tertiary referral health system are presented here. Study Design/Method: Transfusion reaction rates for diverted-versus conventional plasma as well as for PAS-versus conventional platelets were calculated for a two year period(1/1/2016 to 12/31/2017). Statistical analysis was performed. Reported transfusion reactions deemed by the blood bank director to be unrelated to transfusion were excluded. Results/Finding: Between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2017 the overall difference between transfusion reaction rates in diverted plasma (0.5%, 1/202) and conventional plasma (0.7%, 15/1967) was insignificant (p 0.67, 95% CI -0.008 to 0.013). Allergic transfusion reactions accounted for 88% (14/16) of the reported plasma transfusion reactions; there were also two cases of circulatory overload. There was a trend to a lower transfusion reaction rate with PAS platelets (0.2%, 1/498) versus conventional platelets (0.5%, 15/2851), but it did not reach statistical significance (p 0.33, 95% CI -0.002 to 0.008). Allergic transfusion reactions accounted for 81% (13/16) of the reported platelet transfusion reactions; there were also two cases of circulatory overload and one febrile nonhemolytic reaction. The diverted plasma from the single implicated PAS platelet unit did not cause a transfusion reaction. Conclusion: Use of plasma diverted in the production of PAS platelets did not appear to increase (or decrease) the rate of reactions to plasma transfusion. Use of PAS platelets versus conventional platelets tended to reduce the recipients' transfusion reaction rate. The observed risk reduction associated with PAS platelets was consistent with literature reflecting the benefit of decreased recipient exposure to donor plasma proteins. More broadly, the demonstrated noninferiority of diverted plasma represents an additional benefit to blood collection and transfusion services that utilize cell separators with plasma diversion capability during PAS platelet collection.BBC72The Effect of Race on Anti-A/B IgM Antibody Prevalence in South Texas O Rh(D) Positive Male Donors Samantha Ngamsuntikul* 1 , Rachel Beddard 1 , Lorena Aranda 2 and Tiffany Wafford 2 . 1 BioBridge Global, 2 QualTex Laboratories Background/Case Studies: Anti-A and anti-B antibodies pose a risk of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions in recipients with the corresponding antigen. Debate continues on the titer of anti-A and B and which antibody class, IgM or IgG, to test to ensure optimal safety. The US military uses a single titer cutoff of <1:256 of IgM anti-A and B as safe in non-group O recipients. With the resurgence of whole blood use in civilian traumas, elucidating the prevalence of these antibodies in different donor populations is important to enhance donor recruitment. Study Design/Method: O Rh(D) positive male fixed site donors with a history of 2 or more donations were tested. This mitigated for transfusion related acute lung injury while maintaining a robust, committed donor pool. IgM Anti-A and Anti-B (IgM anti-A/B) antibodies were determined using a single titer of 1:256. Plasma from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) samples was tested using saline (0.9%) diluent. Diluted plasma (50uL) was mixed with 50uL of commercially available A1 and B cells, incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, centrifuged for 15 seconds at 3600 rpm, and read for agglutination. Reactivity for either anti-A or anti-B at 1:256 constituted a positive. Donor race, self-declared by the donor, was retrieved from the blood establishment computer system for all tested donors. Results/Finding: The table below shows the results of 1,052 male O Rh(D) positive donors tested, stratified by race. Hispanic is an ethnicity but these donors often self-identify as a separate race; therefore, Hispanic is a race choice on the donor history questionnaire. The results show the prevalence of antibody varies with race with the lowest prevalence in American Indian donors followed by Caucasian/White, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Black/ African American, Multi-Race/Other, Hispanic, and Undeclared. Using Fisher Exact, the prevalence of IgM anti-A/B antibodies were statistically higher in Hispanic donors as compared to Caucasian/White donors. Other race groups had too few numbers to reach statistical significance. Conclusion: In this population of male O Rh(D) positive donors in South Texas, the prevalence of IgM anti-A/B antibody varies with race with the lowest prevalence in Caucasian/White donors. This data can help target whole blood collections to maximize the availability of units low in IgM anti-A/B antibodies.BBC73Prevalence of Hepatitis B and C Viral Markers in Blood DonorsDeferred from Donating Blood on the Basis of a History of Hepatitis Related Risk Factors Ushasree Ravula 1 , Suchet Sachdev* 1 , Neelam Marwaha 1 , Ajay K.

Risk of testing reactive for hepatitis B and C was significantly higher on a deferral on high risk behavior when compared to the other risk factors deferral (P=0.00013). The authors acknowledge that a selection bias may be possible as they could not recruit all donors deferred on the basis of a history of hepatitis related risk factors.Conclusion:The findings of the present study support a deferral for a history of hepatitis related risk factors as the first step towards the pursuit of a safe blood supply.BBC74Metabolic Effect of Alkaline Additives and Guanosine/Gluconate inStorage Solutions for Red Blood Cells Angelo D'Alessandro 1 , Robin van Bruggen 2 , Julie A.

Main improvements in quality of RBCs in the last part of 20th century came from introduction of leukodepletion and PAGGSM and AS-3/5 as generation two AS. Still, storage in the blood bank results in progressive accumulation of a so-called storage lesion, characterized by a large number of in vitro changes in parameters like hemolysis, morphology, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, membrane stability etc. The storage lesion can be, at leas partial, mitigated by storage in novel storage additives, such as alkaline additive solutions. While several novel alkaline additive formulations have been proposed, no metabolomics characterization has been performed to date. Study Design/Method: We performed UHPLC-MS metabolomics analyses of red blood cells stored in SAGM (standard additive in Europe), PAGGSM or alkaline additives SOLX, ESOL-5 and PAG3M for either 1, 21, 35 (end of shelf-life in The Netherlands) and 56 days. Results/Finding: Metabolic linkage analysis provides at a glance an overview of metabolic rewiring across additives, indicating a strong effect on redox homeostasis, carboxylic acid, fatty acid and purine metabolism in alkaline additives when compared to SAGM. Results indicate that alkaline additives (especially PAG3M) better preserve 2,3-DPG and ATP.",

On the other hand, 172 donations were confirmed positive, and in all the regions of the country analyzed, core band was the most prevalent (53.9%). Finally, it was found that the least frequent band in the group of positive donations was NS5; in the North and Pacific Andean regions two band patterns were presented which were NS3-1 and NS5. It is noteworthy that the Caribbean region presented a specific pattern with four bands (NS3-1, NS3-2, NS4 and NS5). Conclusion: The Caribbean region has a different HCV reactivity and positivity in comparison with the rest of the country. The foregoing suggests having this information present to implement antigenic variants according to the geographic location for the screening tests used. Although all banks are located in different regions, it was found that in those confirmed indetermined reactive donors, the NS3-2 band was the most prevalent.BBC79Does Donor Gender Affect Red Cell Quality Following Rejuvenation? Alan D. Gray* 1 and Matt Landrigan 2 . 1 Citra Labs, LLC, a Zimmer Biomet Company, 2 Zimmer Biomet Background/Case Studies: Concerns persist whether Red Blood Cell (RBC) \"storage lesion\", donor age/gender, processing methods, and frequency of donation may impact the in vitro quality of the RBC and negatively affect transfusion quality and safety.[1],[2] RBC rejuvenation was shown to reverse many physical and biochemical changes.[3]  This retrospective analysis was to determine whether gender impacts the in vitro quality measures of RBC stored for 42 days, rejuvenated, and washed (intended for immediate transfusion). Study Design/Method: Leukocyte-reduced CPD/AS-1 (AS-1, n=67) or CP2D/AS-3 (AS-3, n=68) components were prepared from 530-550 mL of whole blood donated by healthy adults (age 18-64, n=80 males and n=55 females) at 2 US sites between 2014-15. After 42 days storage at 1 to 6\u00b0C, units were treated with rejuvesol \u00ae Solution (Citra Labs, LLC, 50 mL), incubated at 37\u00b0C \u00d7 60 minutes, washed with 2 L of 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.2% dextrose solution using the COBE 2991 Cell Processor (Terumo) and stored at 1-6\u00b0C for 24 hours. Funds and materials for this study provided by Zimmer Biomet. Results/Finding: In vitro quality measures for female donors (F) and male donors (M) are reported on the day of collection (D-0), after 42 days of storage (D-42), after rejuvenation and washing (PW), and after storage for 24 hours (24Hr) (Table 1). In vitro % recovery was > 97.5% for all units. No significant difference (p>0.05) was observed in ATP and 2,3-DPG on D-0, D-42, PW, and 24hr. Hemolysis was maintained < 1% through 24hr; however, M collected in AS-1 (D-0) or stored in AS-3 (D-42, PW, and 24hr) exhibited significantly higher % hemolysis. Conclusion: RBC rejuvenation provides a beneficial blood component whether RBCs were obtained from F or M as indicated by the in vitro quality measures evaluated. Although maintained below < 1%, RBC obtained from M exhibited slightly higher % hemolysis levels when stored in AS-3 when compared to RBC from F.

Nance 4 . 1 American Rare Donor Program and American Red Cross, 2 ARDP, 3 American Red Cross -National Molecular Laboratory, American Red Cross and American Rare Donor Program Background/Case Studies: It is certainly true that liquid red blood cell (RBC) units are more convenient and practical than frozen units with longer shelf life, easier shipping, no risk of breakage, less resource intensive and less expensive. However, liquid units of rare phenotypes are not always available, and frozen units are relied on in those cases to provide life-sparing and lifesaving treatment. Between 2016 and 2017, there were a total of 1,473 American rare Donor Program (ARDP) requests. Of those, 196 such requests to ARDP were for liquid units only. The outcome of these requests was investigated. Study Design/Method: Requests from calendar years 2016 and 2017 were reviewed for the outcome of requests for liquid units only to determine the number of liquid units found. Units were tallied by ABO/Rh type and other antigen phenotypes. Results/Finding: Facilities placed 196 requests for liquid RBC units of rare phenotypes. Of those requests only 15 (7.6%) requests for 29 units required frozen units to complete the request, all but one included an antigen of high prevalence. The rarity, the ABO/Rh and other antibodies played a factor in the units not being available in the liquid state. Ten of the 15 requests were for Group O RBCs, with 7 O + and 3 O-. Four of the 15 requests involved RBC phenotypes lacking U, with 2 more for RBCs lacking S and s (U VAR ) and accounted for 48% of the requested units not found in liquid state.

Risk questions that do not identify donors as MSM could allow low risk sexually active MSM to donate. Individual risk assessment questions could be included on the Donor History Questionnaire (DHQ) either individually to identify donors for deferral or to be used in an algorithm to identify low-risk individuals. It is unclear what impact such alternative risk questions would have on donors and collections. We surveyed whole blood donors to determine what proportion would answer yes to potential alternative risk questions, and to rate the acceptability of being asked the questions on the DHQ. Study Design/Method: Two questionnaires were developed. Q1 asked potential individual risk questions in recent time periods. Q2 asked donors to rate their comfort with answering these questions on a 5 point scale. Over a 3 week period in January/February 2018, all whole blood donors attending a collection site in Canada were invited to self-complete a paper questionnaire. The days of Q1 and Q2 were randomized.Results/Finding: Of 36,241 donors attending, 31,904 (88%) completed Q1. Of 34,947 donors attending, 30,278 (87%) completed Q2. First time donors were more likely to answer yes to risk questions than repeat donors (Table 1, p<0.01) although more said they used condoms. Many donors said they were uncomfortable (defined as somewhat uncomfortable, very uncomfortable or would refuse to donate) being asked about anal sex (18%) on the DHQ, and 7 -9% were uncomfortable with the other questions. Conclusion: Risk questions that are often proposed as alternatives to the MSM history questions identify significant proportions of donors, particularly new donors. Deferral based on any of these questions would have a substantial negative impact on blood collections in general, and particularly on recruitment of new donors. Questions about anal sex appear to be the most sensitive.

Of these, 28 were for liver transplants, 92 for apheresis (either plasma or RBC exchange), 33 for trauma with the remaining 54 cases being used by other teams including emergency medicine, obstetrics and critical care. Usage of the MBRs increased over time, with an overall average of 0.95 times/day (range 0.2/day in September to 1.36/day in February). Temperaturerelated waste of RBCs and plasma, as a fraction of total RBCs and plasma issued, averaged 1.48% before implementation (range 0.8% to 3.0% per month) and 1.17% after implementation (range 0.7% to 1.7% per month). The rate decreased more for plasma (2.30% to 1.38%, 40% decrease) than RBCs (1.19% to 1.10%, 8% decrease). At a cost of $216 per red cell unit and $30 per plasma unit, the cost savings, based on the improvement in average wastage, is $938 per month, for a total of $7,506 over 8 months. Conclusion: Implementation of MBRs for MTPs and other high-volume transfusions decreases temperature-related waste of blood products, largely by enabling thawed plasma to be returned to inventory. Benefits include saving technologist time to discard units and receive new units, and better stewardship of the donated products.

            "text": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT ABSTRACT Background/Case Studies: Our blood center has observed a seasonal increase in the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) repeat reactive rates (RR) using the Ortho enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) platform during fall and early winter months. During 2017, this increase was especially marked. The etiology of higher seasonal rates is unclear; however, interfering cross-reactive antibodies following influenza vaccination have been previously implicated. Study Design/Method: The RR for anti-HBc and other blood donor screening ELISA assays were analyzed for the past three years (2015) (2016) (2017) . We compared the RR for our blood center (BC), as well as all blood centers (ABCs) for whom we perform testing (10 total). We assessed the reactive rates for the other required hepatitis markers used for blood donor screening, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and the nucleic acid test for hepatitis B virus DNA (NAT-HBV). We also reviewed donor records for reported vaccinations within the past 8 weeks for all blood donors, as well as those with reactive anti-HBc results. Results/Finding: Seasonal increases in the anti-HBc RR were observed during the study period for ABCs. This increase was observed only with the anti-HBc assay and not with the other blood donor screening tests. The seasonal increase in the reactive rate was only observed with the anti-HBc assay and not the other ELISA tests. The RR of the other HBV donor screening tests (HBsAg and NAT-HBV) did not increase compared to the annual average in 2017 for ABCs (0.042% and 0.004%), respectively. During 2017, the RR for anti-HBc between the months of February and August averaged 0.14% for our BC and 0.21% for ABCs. During 2017, anti-HBc RR peaked in October and November for our BC at 0.77 and 0.68%, respectively, compared to 0.70 and 0.80% for ABCs. In comparison, the peaks for anti-HBc RR for ABCs were 0.46 and 0.61% in Oct and Nov 2016, and 0.34 and 0.40% in Oct and Nov 2015. The donor record review in 2017 during a selected period (Nov 20-Dec 28) revealed 53% of donors with reactive anti-HBc results reported a vaccination within the previous eight weeks, compared to 20% of all blood donors during the same time frame. Of those, the majority were influenza virus vaccinations. Conclusion: We document a seasonal increase in the RR of the Ortho anti-HBc assay used for blood donor screening during the fall and early winter months, which showed an exaggerated increase during 2017. While the cause of this phenomenon is unclear, the possibility that some donors develop antibodies after vaccination that cross-react with this assay cannot be excluded. This has resulted in a significant loss of blood donors, most of whom are presumed to be non-infectious for hepatitis B. Increased RR were not observed in the other hepatitis B markers used for donor screening. While the FDA allows a re-entry process for donors that have had repeat reactive tests on two separate occasions, this assay-specific problem has resulted in an excessive number of deferred blood donors. In the advent of NAT testing for hepatitis B, a larger question to address is whether this screening test increases the safety of our blood supply.",

In mainland France, the number of reported cases increased from 701 and 666 in 2015 and 2016, respectively, to over 2980 during the first 10 months of 2017 with a frequency peak in July 2017. A significant number of cases appeared associated with MSM activity as deduced from an 80% proportion of males among notified cases and the detection of MSM-associated outbreak strains in > 90% of analyzed cases. Study Design/Method: We report HAV incidence in blood donors, HAV risk factors, viral load and genotypes, involved blood products and recipient outcome before (2015 and 2016) and during the 2017 HAV outbreaks in France. Hepatitis A virus NAT screening is a requirement for donations contributing to plasma-derived medicinal products. Performed by EFS on behalf of the LFB, HAV testing is carried out using the Procleix HAV/B19 assay (Tigris System automation-Grifols) on all blood donations. Viral load in individual samples was assessed with the RealStar\u00ae HAV RT-PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics) with serial dilutions of the WHO International Standard for HAV RNA NAT assays as quantification curve. A 508 base-pair fragment encompassing the VP1/2A junction was amplified and sequenced for strain characterization. Results/Finding: Hepatitis A virus RNA prevalence of blood donations was $5 fold higher in 2017 than in 2015-2016 period (4,4/10E6 vs 0,85/10E6, p=0.0005). Frequency peaked at 9.4 /10E6 donations in April-July 2017, at Background/Case Studies: The Armed Services Blood Program (ASBP) was established in 1951 and became fully operational in 1962. As a tri-service organization, the ASBP collects, processes, stores and distributes blood and blood products to Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and their families worldwide on a daily basis. Through the use of customer service cards we listen to the needs of our customers and stakeholders to measure their donating experience. The Cadet Summer Training blood drives consist of 17 different Regimental blood drives between July and August. Three participating ASBP Donor Centers (designated as Donor Center A, Donor Center B, and Donor Center C) coordinated to accomplish the drives, process and ship blood components. All blood must be shipped within 4 days of collection to overseas locations in support of US military operations. These blood drives are large in comparison to a \"normal\" blood drive as they will produce over 3,000 units of whole blood collectively Study Design/Method: The comment card was used to measure cadet donor satisfaction with the length of time it took to donate blood. 1072 comment cards were distributed to 2908 cadet blood donors with a 57% response rate. \"Strongly Agree\" data was given a score of 5, \"Agree\" was a score of 4. The response percentage was multiplied by this score to determine a level of satisfaction with each donor center. This level of satisfaction was compared to the staffing model and mix of personnel that each of the three donor centers used at each drive. Staffing models differ in the number of phlebotomist, interviewers, and overall personnel. Results/Finding: Of the three staffing variables, only the number of interviewers seemed to be correlated directly to the amount of satisfaction that cadet donors had with the amount of time spent donating blood. The overall satisfaction rate was 4.2%. The individual donor center rate ranging from 3.5 to 4.6 percent. The total staffing ranged from 21-26 personnel and the number of phlebotomist ranged from 6-8, with little fluctuation in overall satisfaction. Simply stated, when the number of staff members performing donor interviews was increased, the donor satisfaction increased.Conclusion: This connection between interviewers and satisfaction will be used in the planning, budgeting and execution of future CST blood drives in the hope that ASBP might keep theses cadets as lifelong donors and advocates of the military program. Background/Case Studies: The algorithm for testing of repeat reactive (RR) results for antibodies against Hepatitis C (anti-HCV) has changed after production of the CHIRON RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA (RIBA) was discontinued by its manufacturer; the RIBA test was the only supplemental/confirmatory test for anti-HCV licensed in the US for testing of blood donors. While the assay was still available, our blood center was testing all RR anti-HCV where the HCV NAT was negative by RIBA. The current testing algorithm involves testing samples found to be RR for anti-HCV (initial test for anti-HCV is a chemiluminiscent assay anti-HCV 3.0 ChLIA) by an alternate screening method for anti-HCV (enzyme immunoassay Anti-HCV 3.0 EIA). The samples which were RR for anti-HCV and NAT HCV positive were not tested any further. Study Design/Method: We analyzed the RR rates for anti-HCV for five years prior to (2008 to 2012) and five years after discontinuation of RIBA (2013 to 2017) in order to see if there was any significant impact on donor deferrals due to RR anti-HCV, NAT HCV negative. Our blood center defers all donors who test RR for anti-HCV, regardless of results of supplemental or confirmatory testing, and we do not currently have reentry protocols in place, however reentry may be considered after six months. The indeterminate and positive RIBA results were associated with HCV lookbacks, and positive results by both anti-HCV screening methods are also associated with lookbacks. The RR rates were calculated as a percentage out of the total number of donors per year, and the results of the supplemental/confirmatory results were calculated as a percentage out of the total number of donors per year as well as a percentage out of the RR results.Results/Finding: The results are summarized in the table below.Conclusion: The discontinuation of RIBA did not have a major impact on either donor deferral, and subsequent donor notification, or initiation of lookbacks for HCV, as the percentages of RR donors testing positive or indeterminate by RIBA are similar to the percentages testing positive by the current methods. From our analysis, it seems that those cases previously resulted as indeterminate, may have been in fact not indicative of anti-HCV detection, as the negative rate on supplemental testing has increased after RIBA discontinuation, from 45% -69% to 62% -72%, but this cannot be concluded with certainty since samples were not tested by the current methods. Background/Case Studies: Blood Services Group (BSG) implemented whole-blood derived pooled platelet by buffy coat method in 2012. Back then, BSG prepared pooled platelets using conventional pooling kits by train-pooling method of 4 buffy coat units and a unit of plasma with centrifuges and semi-automated extractors. This method was tedious and time consuming with a significant amount of manual handling. In March 2017, BSG adopted the use of TACSI PL Kit by fan-pooling method of 4 buffy coat units and a unit of plasma with the TACSI PL system for pooled platelets preparation with the aim to improve efficiency for the platelet preparation process. Study Design/Method: This study is to compare the quality parameters, process efficiency and workflow after switching the pooled platelet preparation process to the TACSI PL system. All quality control (QC) parameters data over a 1 year period for both conventional platelet pooling kit system and TACSI PL System were analysed. The QC measurements studied were (1) volume, (2) pH measurement, (3) residual leukocyte count, (4) platelet yield and (5) sterility testing. Descriptive statistical and graphical analysis were performed using Microsoft Excel. The total time and number of staff required for processing a typical batch of 24 units of pooled platelets of the two different method were studied. Workflow and space requirement for both processing system were also compared. Results/Finding: All quality parameters for both methods were within the specified QC criteria with no significant difference. The total processing time for a batch of 24 units of pooled platelets had significantly reduced by 32% with the TACSI PL system. Staffing requirement also reduced from 3 to 2 headcounts with the new system. The workflow for TACSI PL system is also more streamline with fewer steps and shorter walking distance. Physical pooling of buffy coat is easier and faster with fan-pooling method as compared to the train pooling method of the previous system. Balancing of buckets for centrifugation in TACSI PL system is no longer required as the equipment is able to self-balance. Space requirement for pooled platelet processing for accommodating all equipment, workbenches and working space has also reduced by 28%. Conclusion: Quality indicators of pooled platelet using TACSI PL System were equivalent to those prepared from the conventional pooling kit. The TACSI PL system has streamlined the work processes and improved significantly in operation efficiency.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: In 2015 a pilot study was performed internally using a 2 cell antibody screen to retest for red cell antibody reactivity in RBC units after leukofiltration and addition of AS3 (110 mL) using integral segments. Data suggested that 28.2% of RBC units centrifuged hard (4150 RPM for 9 min) retested negative, while 10.3% of RBC units centrifuged soft (3000 RPM for 4 min) retested negative. Based on these data our institution applied for and received an FDA variance to retest RBC units with donor antibodies from segments. If retesting is negative, these RBC units are released into general inventory without additional labeling or antibody identification. This is beneficial as local transfusion service practice dictates very limited ability to transfuse antibody-positive RBCs. Study Design/Method: Red Cell antibody testing is performed on a 6mL EDTA sample using the Immucor Capture-R\u00ae Ready-Screen\u00ae (Pooled Cells). Reactive samples are confirmed by 2-cell antibody screen performed using Ortho MTS Anti-IgG Gel Card\u2122. Plasma products are discarded based upon the original antibody screen results. Background/Case Studies: Weak D testing is not currently required for prenatal or patients requiring blood transfusion, however it is still required to be performed on Rh negative babies of Rh negative mothers to assess the risk of D immunization and to determine if they are RhIG candidates. Because the reagents for D typing over the year have changed and Weak D testing is usually performed by the tube method, new technologies as the Gel methodology may be more sensitive by detecting Weak D phenotypes during routine testing without additional incubation at AHG phase. Therefore it is possible that if a laboratory performs routine testing using gel methodology, Weak D tube testing could be discontinued even for Rh negative babies of Rh negative mothers. But do we have enough data? Study Design/Method: Over a period of six months, from January 2017 to June, 2017, 66 cord blood samples were tested by three different methodologies, 42 cord blood were found to be Rh positive and 14 Rh negative. The cord blood were tested using automated gel methodology, manual gel methodology the tube method Weak D by incubating for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Automated and gel methodology was performed using the Erytra analyzer and gel cards manufactured by Grifols Diagnostics. The D tube typing was performed using Seraclone monoclonal anti-D (RH1) blend by BioRad Medical Diagnostics. Results/Finding: Of the 66 cord blood tested, 30.4% (14) cords were found to Rh negative and 69.6% (42) were found to be Rh pos. No discrepancy was found for all Rh negative cord blood tested by both gel and the tube methods however of the 46 Rh pos cord bloods, 2 were typed as Rh neg at Immediate spin tube method but yield a 4 + using the gel method, automated and manual. All Rh pos cord bloods were weak D positive at AHG phase using the tube method. No Rh negative cord blood in gel was found to be Rh positive by the tube method therefore proving the theory that no Weak D tube testing should be required if a cord blood is found to be Rh negative by the gel method.",

At this point it is believed that the gel methodology would detects most of types of Weak D or Partial D phenotypes during routine testing, therefore if the primary method of testing by a transfusion medicine laboratory is gel, the Weak D tube testing should be discontinued for cord blood testing. Background/Case Studies: Single donor platelets (SDP), derived by apheresis, had been used only as a second option at our institution due to their higher cost, with pooled random donor platelet concentrates (PC) being the first choice. To reduce patient exposure to PC originating from multiple donors and associated adverse effects, a Plateletpheresis Donation Subdivision capable to meet an annual need of 500 SDP units has been established at our blood bank. While the reason for such sustainable in-house production is mediated by clinical advantages of using SDP over PC, the economic efficiency of this approach is also a key factor in decision making regarding its implementation. Most of our donors are first-time donors, some with borderline venous access, which entails a search for an economically efficient device adaptable to a wide range of donors. Study Design/Method: Collection efficiency (CE) and rate, processing time, donor adaptability and exposure to anticoagulant (ACDA) were retrospectively compared using four apheresis devices: Amicus (Fresenius) and Cobe Spectra (Terumo BCT) using double-needle collection sets as well as Spectra Optia and Trima Accel-7 (both Terumo BCT) using single-needle sets. To evaluate device applicability to a variety of donors, they were categorized to 4 groups based on their venous access, group 1 being the most difficult to manage (smallest venous diameter). Results/Finding: This analysis included data from 800 procedures, 200 performed on each device. Males comprised 98% of donors, 93% were firsttime donors with an average age, TBV, hematocrit and platelet pre-count of 34y, 5376ml, 43% and 232 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively. CE was highest with Spectra Optia (65.4%) followed by Trima Accel-7 (63.7%), Amicus (52.6%) and Cobe Spectra (49.5%). However, Trima Accel-7 was significantly more economically efficient, with 72.6% of collections yielding double-dose units compared with 61%, 54% and 50.4% by Cobe Spectra, Spectra Optia and Amicus, respectively. Collection rate (yield/duration) of Trima Accel-7 was significantly higher (7.1 \u00d7 10 9 Plt/min) than that of other devices (6.3, 5.9 and 5.6 \u00d7 10 9 Plt/min for Spectra Optia, Cobe Spectra and Amicus, respectively). The ACDA volume used with Amicus was significantly greater than with other systems (p<0.0001). While Spectra Optia was suitable solely for donors in groups 3 and 4 (37% of donors), Cobe Spectra and Amicus (double-needle) were adaptable to a wider range of donors from groups 2-4 (88%). Only Trima Accel-7, although using a single needle set, could be adapted to 100% of donors due to its ability to adjust to both low and high venous resistance. product that is less useful/ less cost effective because production surpassed the transfusion needs of the hospital. A process was needed to improve and better utilize the staff and resources, avoid wastage and maximize blood component production. Study Design/Method: This quality improvement began in October 2014. It started with the transfer of excess production of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and unused platelets to the main hospital, a trauma center, prior to expiration. The project required obtaining large transport coolers and validation, revise the standard operating procedure (SOP), validate the shipping function of the blood bank computer system to create a packing slip and get statistical reports, revise the FDA registration, find an efficient and cost effective way to obtain wet ice for red cell transport, and dry ice for FFP transfer, establish an effective communication system between facilities and reliable and cost effective transportation of the product. Finally, a \u221280\u00b0C freezer was purchased to store the FFP collected by the blood donor center. Challenges included obtaining wet ice to transport red blood cells and dry ice for the FFP, reliable transportation and efficient communication with the receiving facility. Several innovative ideas were tried and discarded until a final solution worked. The main hospital later on started sending irradiated blood products to our transfusion service in return, avoiding the need to order irradiated blood products from a blood center, savings added up to an extra $124,970. Conclusion: The blood product transfer initiative had improved the blood product management and cost savings to the organization as a whole. Joint initiatives between similar departments in sister institutions can lead to substantial quality improvements as shown. Areas for collaboration in Transfusion Medicine in the future are blood collections, therapeutic apheresis, stem cell collection, antibody identification and provision of compatible blood products for complex red cell and platelet antibodies among others. Background/Case Studies: In 2006, in an effort to mitigate the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) the AABB recommended measures to reduce the incidence of transfusing high plasma volume products (HPVP) from donors who may possess HLA antibodies. Given that multiparous women have a higher prevalence of HLA antibodies, the majority of HPVP are now collected from male donors. Of note, the male donor pool expanded in December 2015 when the FDA changed its policy from indefinite deferral of men who have sex with men (MSM) to a one-year deferral from last sexual encounter. As MSM are now eligible to donate, the presence of HLA antibodies could have implications in HPVP donation. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HLA antibodies amongst a cohort of MSM.Study Design/Method: Banked serum samples were obtained from MSM enrolled in the Emory Involvement study, an observational cohort study of sexually active MSM conducted from 2010-2014. HLA antibodies were detected by flow cytometry screen (FlowPRA\u00ae, One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA). Results of Class I and Class II HLA antibodies were assessed in the entire cohort and compared between those with HIV-positive and -negative controls. Results/Finding: Serum samples from 81 subjects were tested. Overall, 6/81 (7%) individuals had positive FlowPRA screens. Three individuals had class I antibodies alone, 1 had class II antibodies alone, and 2 had class I and II antibodies. The average PRA was 10% (class I) and 12% (class II). Of the 81 MSM, 45 were HIV-negative and 36 were HIV-positive. The prevalence of HLA antibodies was similar in the HIV-positive and -negative groups with 3/36 (8%) and 3/45 (7%), respectively. Among the HIV-positive males, 2 had class I antibodies alone while the other had class I and II antibodies. In the HIV-negative group, 1 had class I antibodies alone, 1 had class II antibodies alone, and 1 had class I and II antibodies. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first description of the prevalence of HLA antibodies among sexually active MSM. We found that approximately 7% of MSM in our cohort had HLA antibodies, which is higher than previous reports of the general male blood donor population (1-2%). Also, we found no difference in the prevalence of HLA antibodies between HIV-positive and -negative MSM, indicating HLA sensitization is not impacted by HIV status. The data provided herein may prove useful in collection and testing practices and policies for MSM donors. In particular, as of 2014 AABB Standard 5.4.1.2 stipulates that previously pregnant women can donate HPVP provided that screening for HLA antibodies is negative. The higher prevalence of HLA allosensitization in MSM compared to the total male population warrants consideration of screening MSM prior to HPVP donation. Background/Case Studies: Universal blood screening is necessary to prevent transfusion transmitted HTLV infections (anti-HTLV I/HTLV II) in endemic countries. In non-endemic countries, selective testing may avoid unnecessary deferrals for donors at high risk, such as returning travelers from or donors born in countries with a high HTLV prevalence. Blood centers require high throughput anti-HTLV I/HTLV II assays with high specificity and sensitivity to prevent unnecessary donor deferrals while maintaining a safe blood supply. In addition, continued pressures on laboratory operations demand that assays perform on platforms capable of increased walk away time and enhanced automation in areas of reagent management, retest options, and commodity/waste management. To address the need for such screening assays, an improved automated assay for the detection of antibodies against HTLVI/II has been developed. Study Design/Method: The performance of the new chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to HTLV I and HTLV II was evaluated on a next generation automated platform, Abbott Alinity s. Reproducibility was assessed over 5 days using HTLV I and HTLV II positive samples. Specificity was evaluated on samples obtained from volunteer blood donors (n=15,877) obtained from the United States. Sensitivity was evaluated using 706 preselected anti-HTLV I, anti-HTLV II, and anti-HTLVI/II undifferentiated positive specimens, and samples from individuals with HTLV I/II associated diseases. Sensitivity and specificity samples were split across 3 reagent lots during testing. Confirmation of repeatedly reactive specimens was done using the MP Diagnostic HTLV Blot 2.4. Study Design/Method: The Transfusion Service (TS) reached out to the Clinical staff to review processes for ordering, receiving, storage in the Operating Room (OR), transfusing and returning of blood products. Wastage data was evaluated by service line to determine where products were being wasted as well as the number products that were sent to the OR only to be returned. Results/Finding: Three areas of focus were identified: 1) Massive Transfusion Protocols (MTPs), 2) Temperature indicators, and 3) OR Handling of blood products. MTP wastage is expected, but 50% of the cryoprecipitate (Cryo) was being discarded. The hospital system decided to update the MTP cycle to star Cryo on cycle 2 and subsequent even cycles rather than every cycle. Discussion with staff determined there was inconsistent notification to the TS when the MTP was being deactivated resulting in additional plasma and Cryo being thawed and wasted. On the nursing units, RBCs were being returned if the patient was not immediately able to be transfused. Communication was sent out to remind nursing staff to ensure that a consent was signed, vitals taken and a transfusion line established prior to requesting the blood. Also if a short delay was expected that it was better to keep the unit on the floor and start the transfusion as soon as possible as long as it was completed within the 4 hours post issue. All wastage was entered into the error management system including associated costs of the products. For the OR, data was collected by service line to show the biggest offenders for returning and wasting blood products. This was shared at the Transfusion Committee meeting to guilt the offenders into improving their ordering habits. In August 2017 over 50% of units sent for cardiac surgery were being returned (349 of 686). O negative blood is remotely stored in the OR. Review of the resupply process found that units were not being placed into storage in a timely manner. TS began tracking who was notified when replacement products were sent via the tube system to hold that individual responsible for timely storage. A decrease in wastage as well as number of returned units from the OR was seen over several months starting in September 2017. Conclusion: Although the wastage was not caused by the TS, the corrective action was expected to be led by the TS. Data was able to show clinical staff specific patterns to help drive needed changes. Understanding both the clinical and the TS side of a transfusion was key to understanding where improvement was needed. Associating a dollar figure to the wastage was a way to get clinical staff to understand the impact of blood product wastage.",

Bryant and Sean Yates. University of Texas Medical BranchBackground/Case Studies: The 5-day shelf-life of platelet products is intended to reduce the risk of bacterial proliferation and potential for transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections. Consequently, platelets have high rates of wastage due to expiration, which is problematic as they are a valuable resource in terms of therapeutic benefit and cost. Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its second draft guidance concerning bacterial risk control strategies, permitting the use of a rapid bacterial detection device to extend the shelf-life of apheresis platelet products up to 7-days. Given expectant finalization of these regulatory changes, the objective of our study was to evaluate the economic impact concerning acquisition cost and wastage of apheresis platelets before and after implementation of rapid bacterial testing at a large academic medical center. Study Design/Method: We conducted a retrospective review of apheresis platelet acquisition cost and wastage due to expiration at two successive time points: 12-months before and 6-months after implementation of rapid bacterial testing (RBT). Bacterial testing was performed on 6 and 7-day apheresis platelet units per FDA guidelines. Platelet units wasted due to expiration on day 5 owing to non-FDA approved storage containers were excluded from the study. Results/Finding: During the 12-month period before implementation of RBT, 332 apheresis platelet units expired out of 1,371 purchased, translating into an expiration rate of 24%. Conversely, annualized data from the 6months following RBT implementation resulted in 117 apheresis platelet units expiring out of 1,168 platelet units purchased, translating into an expiration rate of 10% and corresponding with a 58% reduction in platelet units wasted. Annualized, the direct cost of RBT equals $22,515.06. Using the mean apheresis platelet unit cost of $516.96 reported in the 2013 AABB Blood Survey Report and accounting for the direct cost of RBT, implementation of RBT corresponded with a projected annual cost savings of $88,823.66 at our institution. Conclusion: In a large academic medical center, the introduction of rapid bacterial testing led to a significant reduction in both apheresis platelet acquisition cost and wastage due to expiration. Our findings suggest that rapid bacterial testing can simultaneously enhance the safety of apheresis platelet transfusions and contribute to significant cost savings.",

Bellevue Hospital-NYULMC Background/Case Studies: On February 14, 2017, the NAC on Blood and Blood Products published a statement recommending that CMV safe (leukoreduced) and CMV IgG seronegative products be considered equivalent except for intrauterine transfusion. The NAC further recommend that the Canadian Blood Services stop providing CMV seronegative units to hospitals and develop a new process to maintain a small inventory of CMV seronegative components for the sole purpose of intrauterine transfusion. Given that our municipal public system exclusively uses leukoreduced products, does not support an organ or stem cell transplant program, and only infrequently preforms intrauterine transfusions at one facility, implementation of the NAC recommendations might be reasonable option to reduce laboratory costs without jeopardizing patient safety. We sought to evaluate the potential cost savings of adopting the NAC's CMV recommendations. Study Design/Method: Annual blood product orders from our sole supplier from 2015 to 2017 were analyzed to determine the number of CVM seronegative RBCs and SDPs purchased and the associated additional costs for the CMV enhancement. The actual costs were compared and evaluated to determine the impact of no longer offering the ordering providers the option of requesting CMV seronegative in addition to the already CMV safe (leukoreduced) blood products that they were receiving.",

All prescribed patients in the period were transfused (total, partial or untreated doses). In the same period before the implementation, a total of 2083 platelet doses was available, rendering 2059 TE, with 173 (8.3%) discarded; also, there were 3 TPD (0,1%) due to limited supply. All data are shown in Table 1 .Conclusion: Despite the increase in the number of transfused platelets after PR introduction, we were able to reduce the number of discarded units in the period (n=129 doses or \u22485% of the inventory) due to a more stringent inventory control (collection and transfusion), with reasonable savings in the final budget due to the high cost of PR. Our great challenge is the assurance of supply in situations with greater demand (disasters), since we are the only service in our country that has implemented this technology so far. Conclusion: A vital responsibility of blood bank is to ensure that the donated blood is used (minimizing waste) while having sufficient stock available to deal with emergencies. An effective inventory management procedure relays on simple daily monitoring of blood unit stock and waste. Patient demand varies within the same institution from time to time and this should also be taken in consideration to avoid either an increase or a decrease in ISI and WAPI values. Finally, setting a daily unreserved stock limits is very important to assure scrutinized monitoring and remedial action, but the benefit would only be maximized if the limits were set upon ABO hospital demand and ABO distribution percentages in the population. It is also worth noting, that keeping a strong donor recruitment base is very important to manage the inventory in a flexible manner based on daily changes.",

Duke University HospitalBackground/Case Studies: Receiving blood products in to inventory shipped from a blood supplier is a non-billable workflow in the transfusion service. Steps include unpacking the shipment box, comparing paper list of products to received units, scanning units into the Transfusion Service Information System (TSIS), set up for re-typing if an RBC, and then finally placing product into inventory. Antigen testing on units is particularly vulnerable to increased time and error as each result will have to manually added to the product entry in the TSIS. Electronic packing lists are currently available to move specimens around without the need to manually re-enter each item; this has not been available for blood products shipped from an outside supplier. We sought to quantify the time benefit an electronic packing list by measuring time spent receiving blood products into the TSIS. Study Design/Method: The electronic delivery step of receiving blood was timed for random staff and shifts over a 2 week period at a large academic tertiary care hospital. All shifts and technologist experience levels were represented. Unpacking, segment management and re-typing were excluded from the measured time. Data analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA). Deliveries more than 3 SD from mean were excluded from results. Results/Finding: The time study captured 1687 products during 129 separate delivery episodes for a mean of 13.1 units per episode. All product types were represented, with the majority being RBCs (54.5%). The average time of delivery across all products was 12.0 s/unit; component specific delivery times are presented in Table 1 . RBCs labeled with antigen testing results took a mean of 28.9 s/unit. Using 2 years of inventory data, average monthly product volumes were compared against the time required to bring in each unit. This calculation predicts that the Transfusion Service spends 17.3 hours per month on computer entry of blood products. ",
