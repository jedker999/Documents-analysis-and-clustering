Farmed animals are subject to human imposed constraints and for a very long time the choice of farming techniques was based primarily on the efficiency of production systems for the provision of food. However when choosing methods for keeping and managing animals in order to protect these animals against mistreatment and poor welfare, it is necessary to know how their welfare is affected by the various methodologies. These public concerns apply to cows. Fraser (1999 Fraser ( , 2008 point out that there are at least three different concepts considered when animal welfare is discussed. One set of concepts is focusing on the animal's health and biological functioning, a second set is focusing on the animal's ability to live a natural life, and a third set is focusing on the degree to which the animal experiences aversive or positive feelings, such as pain, fear or pleasure. As Fraser points out, there is actually a considerable degree of overlap between these three sets of concern. For example, both poor health and frustration of much normal behaviour of animals are likely to lead to suffering. However, Fraser did not advocate including degree of naturalness in the definition of welfare or its assessment. The separation into three aspects is also confusing because, as explained below, biological functioning is not distinct from suffering and other feelings since these are biological mechanisms. To some extent, the way in which any one person refers to how animals should be treated reflects his or her personal values. For example, farmers and veterinarians often see animal welfare primarily in terms of health and good biological functioning. In contrast, animal welfare groups place more emphasis on the extent to which animals are not suffering from pain etc. Most of the disagreements about animal welfare reflect the fact that people differ in which aspects of animal welfare they emphasise. It is sometimes claimed that the number of different definitions of animal welfare shows that there is a widespread disagreement, even between scientists, about what constitutes good and poor welfare. This is not so. Often the definitions of animal welfare differ in wording or place more emphasis on certain aspects of welfare compared with others. There is a considerable degree of agreement between scientists in what they consider as the most serious risks to animal welfare, as this report demonstrates. Hence this report on animal welfare addresses the scientific concepts relevant to the concerns of the public and other stakeholders and explains how these are taken into account.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 39, "end": 49, "text": "(EU, 1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 662, "end": 674, "text": "Fraser (1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF337"}, {"start": 675, "end": 690, "text": "Fraser ( , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF338"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1."}, {"text": "To be useful in a scientific context, the concept of welfare has to be defined in such a way that it can be scientifically assessed. This also facilitates its use in legislation and in discussions amongst farmers and consumers. As discussed below, knowledge of the types of environments in which animals have evolved can help identify some of the challenges to welfare that occur when animals are kept in conditions of modern agriculture. For example, cattle have evolved to graze outdoors with grass as their primary food source. In contrast, in modern agriculture, dairy cattle are often housed indoors, on concrete floors, with refined grains as their prime source of energy. These differences can pinpoint what are the most likely challenges to the welfare of dairy cattle (Spinka, 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 777, "end": 791, "text": "(Spinka, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1059"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1."}, {"text": "The concept of welfare is relevant to any kind of animal, although not to plants or inanimate objects. Welfare is a characteristic of an individual animal and is concerned with the effects of all aspects of its genotype and environment on the individual (Duncan 1981) . The common convention is to use the term -welfare\u2016 to refer to the state of the animal itself, while \u2017animal care' is used to refer to the way that people treat animals. Thus the welfare of an animal can be poor or good regardless of whether it is living in the wild or in contact with people. The degree to which the welfare of an animal is good or bad is taken into account when considering what constitutes proper animal care. Broom (1986) defines it as follows: the welfare of an animal is its state as regards its attempts to cope with its environment. Coping means maintaining control of mental and bodily stability in response to a challenge. Welfare therefore includes the extent of failure to cope, which may lead to disease and injury, but also the ease or difficulty in coping. Both the long-term and short-term costs of coping are important for an animal's welfare. For example, an animal may cope with an acute stress in the short-term by taking action that results in a long term reduction in its welfare. For example, dairy cattle may be able to cope with the stresses associated with high milk in lactation, but this coping may result in long-term health problems that are apparent in later lactations. Following the lead of Broom (1986) the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) defines animal welfare as the following. -Animal welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and humane slaughter/killing. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal. The treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment.\u2016", "cite_spans": [{"start": 254, "end": 267, "text": "(Duncan 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 700, "end": 712, "text": "Broom (1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1523, "text": "Broom (1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1."}, {"text": "The welfare of an animal is strongly affected by the extent to which it suffers from unpleasant emotional states or feelings such as pain, fear or frustration. It is likely that animals can also experience positive mental states, such as happiness, and these may have beneficial effects on their welfare (Duncan, 1996; Fraser and Duncan, 1998; Boissy et al., 2007) . Feelings are a part of many mechanisms for attempting to cope with good and bad aspects of life and most feelings must have evolved because of their beneficial effects (Broom, 1998) . Although feelings cannot be measured directly, their existence may be deduced from measures of physiology, behaviour, pathological conditions, etc. Therefore care is necessary to avoid anthropomorphic interpretations. Good welfare can occur provided that the individual is able to adapt to or cope, without much difficulty, with the constraints to which it is exposed (Broom, 2006a) . Hence, welfare varies from very poor to very good and can be scientifically assessed. Assessment of welfare means obtaining data that provides information about how good or poor the welfare is. This data will always be partial rather than complete. Some measures of welfare concern the short-term, i.e. minutes or hours, whilst others concern welfare during periods of days, weeks or longer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 318, "text": "(Duncan, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 319, "end": 343, "text": "Fraser and Duncan, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF341"}, {"start": 344, "end": 364, "text": "Boissy et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 535, "end": 548, "text": "(Broom, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 919, "end": 933, "text": "(Broom, 2006a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1."}, {"text": "Welfare measures relevant to the welfare of an animal in its living conditions, i.e. largely long-term problems, are described by Broom and Johnson (2000) and by Broom and Fraser (2007) , while the measures that are most relevant to cattle are described in Rushen et al. (2007) . There are many measures that we can use to assess the welfare of the animal. However, these measures generally indicate the existence of a particular welfare challenge rather than measuring the overall welfare of the animal. In order to judge the overall welfare of the animal, it is necessary to take a wide number of measures. Production criteria, such as measures of growth or milk production, have a place in welfare assessment but must be used with care. However, the failure to grow, reduced ability to reproduce etc. often indicates poor welfare, high levels of production do not necessarily indicate good welfare. For example, sudden drops in milk production, perhaps associated with an illness, might indicate a welfare problem. However, a low average level of milk production in a herd may reflect feeding management rather than the level of welfare per se. A high level of production could increase the risk of poor welfare. In general, to use levels of production to assess welfare, we need to know what the causes of the low production are. The same is true of measures of reproduction. A failure to reproduce does not in itself constitute proof that animal welfare is poor. In fact, the care and raising of young can itself lead to reduced welfare of the mother if the environment does not provide sufficient resources. However, a reduced ability to reproduce most often indicates that the individual is less able to cope with its environment. Therefore reduced fertility and other reproductive disorders can be used as indicators of poor welfare, provided that the causes of the reduced reproduction are understoood. Absence of reproductive opportunity is an obvious example of reduced reproduction that does not indicate poor welfare. More subtle problems can also suggest poor welfare, e.g. where farmers are trying to get cows in calf but the inter-calving interval is long, failure to reproduce or substantial delay in reproduction is likely to be associated with poor welfare. For example, a cow that is not cycling when cows that are coping well are cycling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 154, "text": "Broom and Johnson (2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 162, "end": 185, "text": "Broom and Fraser (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 257, "end": 277, "text": "Rushen et al.

In some situations responses to a wound may not occur because endogenous opioids which act as analgesics are released. In contrast there are many occasions in humans and other species when suppression of pain by endogenous opioids does not occur (Melzack et al., 1982) . However, the feeling of pain is not the only negative emotion that animals feel that can influence their welfare.

For instance, increased heart-rate, adrenal activity, adrenal activity following ACTH challenge, reduced heart-rate variability, or immunological response following a particular type of challenge, can all indicate that welfare is threatened more than following other challenges which do not result in such changes, or which result in smaller changes. Impaired immune system function and some of the physiological changes can indicate a pre-pathological state (Moberg, 1985) . In interpreting physiological measurements such as heart rate and adrenal activity it is important to take account of the environmental and metabolic context, including activity level. Glucocorticoids have various important functions in the body, including facilitation of learning, (Poletto et al., 2003) and are not produced in all potentially damaging situations. Some hormones, such as oxytocin, may indicate pleasurable mental states in animals (Panksepp, 1998; Carter, 2001) . In general, physiological measures have proven most successful in assessing the effect of short-term or acute procedures (e.g. dehorning) on an animal's welfare. Using physiological measures to assess longer term effects, such as those due to housing, is a far more complex enterprise, which has not proven as successful. Studies of the brain activity inform us about the cognitive ability of animals and they can also tell us how an individual is likely to be perceiving, attending to, evaluating, coping with, enjoying, or being disturbed by its environment so can give direct information about welfare (Broom and Zanella, 2004) . Cows have complex brains so must have a great range of possibilities for good or poor welfare. In studies of welfare, there is an especial interest on how an individual feels. As this depends upon high-level brain processing, it is necessary to investigate brain function. Abnormal behaviour and preferred social, sexual and parental situations may have brain correlates.

Studies of animal preference are very useful tools. The fact that an animal avoids strongly an object or event, gives information about its feelings that are evoked when it encounters this object or event and hence about its welfare (Rushen, 1986; . The stronger the avoidance the worse the welfare whilst the object is present or the event is occurring. An individual which is completely unable to adopt a preferred lying posture despite repeated attempts will be assessed as having poorer welfare than one which can adopt the preferred posture. Other abnormal behaviour, which includes excessively aggressive behaviour and stereotypies, such as tongue-rolling in cows, indicates that the perpetrator's welfare is poor. There is some evidence that the performance of some forms of abnormal, stereotyped behaviour can improve the welfare of the animals performing the behaviour (Mason and Latham, 2004) . This does not mean that the performance of the behaviour is a sign of good welfare. A large body of research shows that the conditions that lead animals to perform such behaviours are associated with poor welfare. However, in those conditions, the animals that do not perform these behaviours appear to fare worse than those that do perform the behaviours (Mason and Latham, 2004) . Very often abnormal activities derive from activities that cannot be expressed but for which the animal is motivated. A single physiological, behavioural or other measure indicating that coping is difficult, or that the individual is not coping, can be sufficient evidence that welfare is poor.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 88, "text": "(Wiepkema, 1983)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 324, "end": 338, "text": "(Rushen, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF960"}, {"start": 969, "end": 993, "text": "(Mason and Latham, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF714"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1376, "text": "(Mason and Latham, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF714"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1."}, {"text": "Many people have the opinion that the welfare of animals will be improved if they are allowed to perform more of the behaviour shown in a natural environment. However, although preventing natural behaviour will sometimes cause poor welfare (Lindstr\u00f6m and Redbo, 2000) , there is no reason to think that an animal will inevitably suffer simply because it does not perform all the behaviour patterns shown by its wild ancestors. Indeed, allowing animals to perform some natural behaviour, such as aggressive behaviour or infanticide, may lead to worse welfare. Furthermore, even within a population of animals in natural environments, there will be marked differences between individual animals in the types of behavioural strategies adopted, raising the question of what should be considered as -the\u2016 natural behaviour (Spinka, 2006) . Finally, many studies on different species have revealed how much artificial selection has altered the behaviour of domestic animals (e.g. Price 2002; Jensen 2006) . Applying the concept of natural behaviour is troublesome for cattle since the ancestor of domestic cattle, the wild ox or aurochs (Bos primigenius) of the near east has been extinct for several centuries (Clutton-Brock, 1999) . Furthermore, genetic analysis shows that domestic cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) diverged from the wild species of Bovini (e.g. bison and buffalo) many thousands of years ago (Ritz et al., 2000) . This makes it difficult to determine how much domestication has influenced cattle behaviour and to what extent modern breeds of cattle have retained the behavioural repertoire of their ancestors. From research that has been done on other species (pigs and poultry) it seems most likely that modern dairy cattle have diverged little from their ancestors in respect of most aspects of anatomy, physiology and behaviour. The changes are mostly to do with modifications that allow reproduction and some other functions when there is close human presence, together with changes leading to greater milk production.

Methods of assessing the strengths of positive and negative preferences have become much more sophisticated in recent years. The price, which an animal will pay for resources, or pay to avoid a situation, may be, for example, a distance travelled, a weight lifted or the amount of energy required to press a plate on numerous occasions. The demand for the resource, i.e. the amount of an action which enables the resource to be obtained, at each of several prices can be measured experimentally. This is best done in studies where the income available, in the form of time or energy, is controlled in relation to the price paid for the resource. Methodologies for evaluating the importance of resources to animals have been developed (Kirkden et al., 2003) . Good welfare in general, and a positive status in each of the various coping systems, should have effects that are a part of a positive reinforcement system, just as poor welfare is associated with various negative reinforcers. Once we know what animals strongly prefer, or strongly avoid, we can use this information to identify situations that are unlikely to fulfill the needs of animals and to design better housing conditions and management methods (Fraser and Matthews, 1997) . However, as pointed out by Duncan (1978; and Dawkins (2004) , all data from preference studies must be interpreted taking account of the following possibilities: firstly, an individual may show a positive preference for something in the shortterm which results in its poor welfare in the long-term, and secondly, a preference in a simplified experimental environment needs to be related to the individual's priorities in the more complicated real world.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 168, "text": "(Dawkins, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 905, "end": 927, "text": "(Kirkden et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF585"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1411, "text": "(Fraser and Matthews, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF340"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1454, "text": "Duncan (1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1473, "text": "Dawkins (2004)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "1."}, {"text": "In order to promote good welfare and avoid suffering, a wide range of needs must be fulfilled as the needs have a key role in the interaction between an animal and its environment.

When needs are satisfied there is, in some cases, an increase in a pleasurable experience, in some a decrease in negative experience, and in others a beneficial biological change without involvement of any feeling. Whilst the need may be satisfied by a physiological change in the body or by carrying out a particular behaviour, the need itself is reflected in a control centre in the brain.

Farm may also have a confined site outside the house with a concrete floor as an exercise area. But those areas require a lot of cleaning. Maton et al.

The main restriction to the application of loose housing with straw bed is the large amount of straw that is needed: about 10 kg per cow for a full bed and in deep litter, or 5-6 kg per cow if a separated feeding and exercise area with a concrete floor are applied.

This goal has received wide support because, other things being equal, it should optimise the use of resources, increase farm profit and reduce cost for consumers. In many European countries, yield per cow has more than doubled in the last 40 years. The dramatic increase in yield per cow is due to rapid progress in genetics and management.

Lower fertility reflected by such reproductive measures as longer interval to onset of cyclicity postpartum and lower conception rate earlier in lactation, are indicative of the cows coping with metabolic stress. This may not be a welfare problem if the cows are allowed to cope normally with this stress through a longer calving interval. Unfortunately, intensive production systems seldom provide this allowance. In some countries hormonal and other invasive interventions are used to kick start the reproductive system postpartum, which increases the stress and leads to increase risk of health problems during the transition period of subsequent calving.

Duration, prevalence and severity are aspects that need to be considered to assess the importance of any welfare indicator. For dairy cattle, the major indicators of poor welfare that are associated with selection for high milk production are lameness, mastitis, other metabolic disorders, sub-fertility, and longevity. The impact of selection and breeding can be judged on the basis of its impacts on the welfare of individual offspring and future generations.

The review of 11 epidemiological studies showed clear evidence that cows with high yield in the previous lactation are at increased risk of mastitis and ovarian cysts in the subsequent lactation, but for other diseases the phenotypic association was weak because of the large variability between studies. These results led Ingvartsen et al. (2003) to conclude that examining the relationship in terms of cause (level of milk production) and effect (disease incidence) is inadequate as cows producing more milk are also likely to eat more and make greater use of their body reserves in early lactation (Veerkamp, 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 243, "text": "(Russell et al., 1982", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 332, "end": 354, "text": "(Barkerma et al., 1994", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 355, "end": 378, "text": ", Philipot et al., 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF878"}, {"start": 379, "end": 403, "text": ", Boettcher et al., 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 418, "end": 430, "text": "Guard (1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF413"}, {"start": 457, "end": 477, "text": "Espejo et al.

In high yielding cows, especially during the first part of lactation, the udder can be an extremely large extrusion of the body. The selection for udder shape is performed using linear type traits. Udder shape is defined by a number of single traits like fore and rear udder depths, fore and rear udder attachments, udder width, fore and rear teat placement, or a composite (Short and Lawlor, 1992; Klassens et al. 1992; Boelling and Pollott, 1998, Koenen and Groen, 1998; Tsuruta et al., 2005) . Selection for increased milk production is likely to cause an increase of secretory tissue in the udder and therefore a tendency towards more voluminous udders will always exist. On the other hand by selection for better udder conformation, inconvenient depths or non-functional shapes (e.g. unbalance between fore and rear part) that may lead to early culling can be reduced (Hansen, 2000; Buenger et al., 2001) .

By implementing more balanced selection goals it has been possible to limit the decline of fertility in the SLB breed to about half of what has been observed in other Holstein populations and prevent it in the SRB breed which is much less influenced by germplasm from outside Scandinavia. Resistance to mastitis follows similar trends. There have also been recent improvements in the health of cows in Norway ( s et al., 2007) . In Nordic countries, records are available to include fertility and health traits in selection. The progeny testing of bulls is performed with large progeny group size (>120 daughters/bull) to handle traits with low heritability. The program has a positive impact on smaller breeds, such as the red and white breeds in the Nordic countries (Philipsson and Lindhe, 2003) . It is also clear that, as long as the majority of the black and white dairy bulls tested in the Nordic countries originate from sires outside Scandinavia, where no estimates for genetic merit for health and fertility traits are available, the Nordic effort to improve these traits will have only limited impact (Christensen, 1998 ). An active international germ plasm market makes breeding of dairy cattle truly global. For the Holstein/Friesian breed, which is the dominant dairy breed in the world and accounts for about 80% of all dairy cows in Europe (Van Arendonk and Liinamo, 2003) , increased emphasis on selection for fitness traits should occur in all countries, particularly those that dominate the international germplasm market.

The cows provide for the symbiosis the forestomach reticulorumen as a fermentation chamber with a carefully controlled microenviroment for the microbes. The host takes on the job of seeking feed, grinding it to increase the surface areas for microbial attack and maintaining acceptable pH conditions by volatile fatty acids (VFA) absorption and by a large production of buffering saliva. In return, microbes digest fibre by microbial fermentation and produce mainly short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, which can be used by the host.

Dietary NDF alone, however, did not have a significant relationship with ruminal pH (Allen, 1997), probably due to variability in ruminal fermentability and particle size across forages and fibrous by-product feeds. A variety of systems have been proposed to estimate the minimum amount of fiber necessary in rations for lactating dairy cattle. These systems have generally attempted to guide ration formulation by predicting the amount of chewing that various feedstuffs would generate, or their relative effectiveness at maintaining milk fat percentage (Mertens, 2002) . A new system, physically effective NDF (peNDF) attempts to relate the ability of a feedstuff to promote chewing relative to a hypothetical long grass hay corresponding to 100% physically effective NDF (4 hours of chewing activity per kg of hay) (Mertens, 1997 ). The peNDF system is of particular interest in this discussion since it more closely relates to ruminal pH than other proposed fiber systems. Indeed, the peNDF approach explained 71% of the variation in ruminal pH in published trials used to evaluate the system (Mertens, 1997) . The peNDF of each feed is the product of the Physically Effective Fiber coefficient (pef) and NDF concentration. It was proposed (Mertens, 1997) that the pef of a given feedstuff could be either estimated from tabular values or determined by measuring the proportion of dried sample retained on vertically oscillating screens >1.18 mm. Ideally, the NDF concentration of this retained proportion would also be determined. The peNDF>1.18 of a feed would then be determined by either multiplying its tabular pef by the measured NDF level, or by multiplying the percent retained on screens greater than 1.18 mm by the NDF concentration of the sample or of this retained portion. The authors concluded that the diet should contain at least 22% peNDF>1.18 to maintain an average ruminal pH of 6.0 when using the wet sieving technique to determine pef values (Beauchemin et al., 2003) . Yang et al. (2001) determined peNDFps as the proportion of dry matter retained by the 8 and 19 mm screens of the Penn Sate Particle Separator, multiplied by total dietary NDF content. Absence of an effect of variation in peNDFps on rumen pH when this measure is >16.5% DM was demonstrated. However, feeding diets with a peNDFps of 12.5% dry matter or lower resulted in rumen pH indicative of sub acute ruminal acidosis (SARA) (Plaizier, 2004) . These findings agree with Mertens (1997) who observed a curvilinear relationship between rumen pH and peNDF and the lack of an effect of dietary peNDF content on rumen pH in coarser diets. The limited relationship between peNDFps and rumen pH is also due to the multitude of animal and dietary factors other than peNDFps that affect rumen pH. Prominent among these factors are forage source, concentrate source, acidogenic value of the feed, feeding frequency, and the inclusion of inorganic buffers (Mertens, 1997; Oetzel, 2003; Kleen et al., 2003; Stone, 2004; Rustomo et al., 2006c) . Due to saliva contamination and diurnal variation in rumen pH, the monitoring of rumen pH by spot sampling is less accurate than continuous rumen pH measurement Alzahal et al., 2007) . However, studies using continuous measurement of rumen pH have also not demonstrated significant effects of various measures of peNDF and forage particle size on rumen pH, despite increased chewing has been observed when peNDF was increased (Yang et al., 2001; Beauchemin et al., 2003; Bhandari et al., 2006; Rustomo et al., 2006; Yang and Beauchemin,2006) . Hence, peNDF might be a better indicator of chewing activity than of rumen pH (Yang and Beauchemin, 2006) and of acidogenic value of the feed (Rustomo et al., 2006a,b,c) . This might be explained by the observation from Maekawa et al. (2002) that increased chewing did not sensibly increase daily saliva production, as increased chewing during eating and ruminating subsequently reduced saliva production during time periods when chewing activity was absent. Even when diets have been formulated to contain sufficient fiber and physically effective fiber, the feed eaten by the cows might not result in sufficient rumen buffering capacity due to sorting against long particles in favor of shorter particles (Calberry et al., 2003; Leonardi and Armentano, 2003) . Furthermore, errors in mixing the diet, differences between the assumed and the real dry matter contents of the forages and excess mixing of the diet resulting in excessive chopping up the coarse feed particles, which can result in diets with a lower than expected peNDF contents (Kleen et al., 2003; Oetzel, 2003; Stone, 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 819, "end": 834, "text": "(Mertens, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF741"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1096, "text": "(Mertens, 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF740"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1376, "text": "(Mertens, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF740"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1523, "text": "(Mertens, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF740"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2256, "text": "(Beauchemin et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2277, "text": "Yang et al.

Diets need to be well balanced to provide enough energy and protein to meet requirements and sufficient physically effective fibre for maintaining good ruminal fermentation. In the past, feeding different feed components of a ration separately to dairy cows (component feeding) was common. The major disadvantage of this feeding regime is that components are not necessarily fed simultaneously. When high yielding cows are fed forages with high amounts of NDF and concentrates with easily fermentable NFC, it is difficult to maintain a stable ruminal pH particularly if the number and size of concentrate meals is not properly established. The cows tend to introduce more concentrates under this feeding regime at the expense of forages.

For mixed rations either all feed components (concentrates, roughages, feed supplements and mineral and vitamin mixes; total mixed ration) or all feed stuffs except the concentrates (partly mixed rations) are mixed. Mixing of feed components according to the dietary calculation can be done precisely with mixer-feeder wagons. In order to ensure complete mixing and a stable mixture of forages, concentrates and supplemental feeds, which vary substantially in particle size, forages need to be chopped to about 18mm. In particular when particle size of forages is too long feed components may separate again in the feed bunk and cows are able to select and sort out preferred feed stuffs predominantly concentrates of high palatability. Rations are mixed commonly from fresh feed stuffs and offered to cows up to three times a day. Good maintenance of feeder-mixing wagons is of crucial importance for a precise mixing of feed stuffs according to the formulation. A water content of 40-50% must be also ensured to optimise the mixture uniformity and to reduce sorting. When some concentrate is fed separately to mixed ration, it is sometimes, with computer control, offered to cows in many small portions throughout the day in order to avoid considerable changes in ruminal pH, due to an overload with rapidly fermentable NFC. Cows are individually recognised at the concentrate feeding station by transponders which are carried either as ear tags or as a necklace. When transponder concentrate feeding is used a sufficient number of feeding stations is necessary to allow all cows easy access without stress or prolonged waiting periods. In high yielding cows offering concentrates only twice daily during milking is seen only exceptionally since ingestion of large amounts NFC from concentrates (more than 2.0-2.5 kg/meal) will lead to an immediate and considerable drop in ruminal pH and thus poses a high risk of SARA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Feeding practices"}, {"text": "To maximise feed intake, feed must be available for dairy cows 24 hours a day. Before fresh feed is offered, the feeding trough is cleaned. Enough feeding places and sufficient space at the trough (not less than 60 cm/head as suggested by De Vries et al., 2004) is important to allow stress free access at all times of the day, in particular when fresh feed is offered. Since cows are kept in confinement during the day, feeds need to be pushed up several times over the day, otherwise the remainder of the diet might get out of their range (see also section 6.1.2 -feeding area\u2016). In recent years feeding cows only on pasture is getting increasingly uncommon for different reasons. One reason is to protect cows from adverse weather conditions (heat, cold, rain, storm). Another reason is that a second cost intensive mobile or stationary milking parlour is necessary on pasture when the distance between the stall with the milking parlour and the pasture is too long for daily walking. When the stall is within a walking distance to pasture, cows may have to walk several kilometers, in particular when in large dairy herds. Long walks on a hard or even rough surface may contribute to overload to claws and thereby to the development of claw diseases (see also chapter 9 -lameness\u2016). But the main reason is that the nutritional value of grass is under constant change over the season and therefore difficult to evaluate. In particular for high yielding cows it is very difficult to calculate a well balanced ration when there is a high uncertainty about the nutritional value of one of the major feed components. Thus, many farmers prefer to feed cows with preserved feed stuffs which nutritional values are known from analysis or available feeding tables. This allows a more reliable ration calculation. In consequence many dairy cows are kept either year round indoors or have daily access to pasture for a restricted period of time (commonly a few hours) in order to allow cows some exercise and to expose cows to external stimuli (see also section 6.8). In other countries, e.g. Sweden, farmers with milking robots leave the door open between the pasture and the barn so that cows can themselves choose to go indoors and eat the total mixed ration (and be milked) and then go out again and graze.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Feeding practices"}, {"text": "Water of sufficient amount and quality is very important for high producing dairy cows.

From the viewpoint of environmental sustainability stanchion barns provide easier solutions than loose housing systems (Jongebreur and Metz, 1999) . In contrast, cows kept in loose housing systems can move around and engage in social behaviour. However, this also includes aggression and most often there will be some competition for resources such as feed and resting areas. A direct comparison of the welfare in different housing systems is complicated because a large number of specific features of the housing, such as for instance bedding material and design of the resting and feeding areas, can affect the welfare.

However, when fed in the barn, both in loose housing systems and in tie-stalls, the cow usually stands with both front legs together. Therefore it is easier for the cow to reach the feed if the trough is elevated above the floor level, and the risk of a cow falling as well as the risk of getting injuries on the front knees and the shoulder is reduced (Rom, 1989; Munksgaard and Krohn, 1990; Waiblinger et al., 2001b) . The risk of getting injuries at the shoulder is also reduced due to reduced load on the shoulder and forelegs (Waiblinger et al., 2001b) . It has been recommended to raise the feed trough 15-20 cm above the bedding level in loose housing and 12-15 cm in tie-stalls (Waiblinger et al., 2001b; Housing Design for Cattle -Danish Recommendation, 2001 ). However, the optimal level depends on the size of the animals. Furthermore, there is some evidence that a narrower feed trough, which ensures that the cow can reach the feed, reduces the risk of traumatic injuries (Munksgaard and Krohn, 1990) . However, when cows are kept in tie-stalls, the stall is also used for resting. Thus the separation between the trough and the stall should not be too high in order to avoid thwarting of the forward movement of the body of the cow when changing position from lying to standing. Also the level of feed trough should not be lower than it is in loose housing so that the head lunge movement is not hindered. Furthermore, it is also necessary to have some separation between the trough and the stall to avoid feed coming into the stall. In tie-stalls compromises between giving the cow easy access to the feed without dragging feed into the stall and easy access to change position from lying to standing is necessary.

During feeding with restricted amounts of feed restraining can limit displacement and provide protection for subordinate cows, and thus to a larger degree ensure that all cows can eat without disturbance. However, cows tied for four hours showed more aggression, increased grooming and lying behaviour when released compared to control cows indicating that tieing for four hours may lead to discomfort and increased motivation for lying down (Bolinger et al., 1997) . However, shorter duration of fixation may not have these negative consequences, and the effects of duration of fixation also seem to depend on the type of food and availability of water at the feed trough .

This, however, will depend on the degree of synchronization between the cows when they eat. For example, in an automated milking system there is less synchrony and so there should be less need for one feeding space per cow. However, if feed is delivered only once a day, there will be more synchronization when cows visit the feed bunk and so the effect of feeding space will be greater. One problem with TMR is that cows sort through the diet so that the cows that are able to have first access to the TMR are not eating the same diet as those that have later access. Increased stocking density can decrease duration of eating and lead to increased displacement from the feed trough (Albright and Timmons, 1984; Henneberg et al., 1986; Olofsson, 1999; DeVries et al., 2004) . When the stocking density increased from one to three or four cows per eating place the level of aggression increased Olofsson 1999) , and in agreement, DeVries et al. (2004) found that the level of displacement was more than doubled when there was 0.5 m per cow compared to 1.0 m per cow at the feed manger. When the stocking density increased both when using headlocks (1.33, 1.0, 0.67 and 0.33 headlocks/cow) and when using a neck bar (0.81, 0.61, 0.41 and 0.21 m/cow) the level of displacement increased and the eating time decreased with increasing stocking density. Furthermore, availability of feed for all cows may also depend on number of feedings per day, speed of milking, cow traffic and the degree of synchronization between the cows when they eat. If there is less synchrony, for instance in an automated milking system, it is likely that there is less need for one feeding space per cow.

Secondly, social space is the space needed to have appropriate social interactions and avoid social stress. Of course in practice physical space and social space often influence the same aspect, overlap or have to be added, for example regarding space at the feeding rack or cubicle width.

Another problem of size-dependent equipment is a large variation in cow size within herds, so that equipment may be appropriate for some animals, but may impact negatively the welfare of larger or smaller individuals.

The type of interaction differs: in high-space vs. low-space the number of threats is higher, but number of displacements including physical contact (butts) is much lower (Wierenga, 1984) . In practice different aspects contribute to the total space allowance and are often associated with each other: width and length of the different alleys, number of resources (especially cubicles, feeding places) per animal as well as possible additional space such as an additional running (idling) area inside or outside the barn. In a given indoor situation additional space in an outside area reduces agonistic interactions: cow herds showed less agonistic interactions when having access to an outdoor yard during the night compared with a closed yard . Reducing only feeding space (length or available feed bunk or number of feeding places) leads to increased aggression (DeVries et al., 2004; Huzzey et al., 2006) . There are also effects of space allowance on other behaviours, health and production. With a larger idling area (alley width behind the cubicles 11 m) more locomotion was observed and non-oestrus cows initiated mountings almost as often as the oestrous cows which was not the case in the small idling area (width of 2m) (Metz and Mekking, 1984) . Existence of an outside run, associated with more space allowance, as well as higher total space allowance (\u22658.6m\u00b2/cow) was associated with lower prevalence of lameness (M\u00fclleder and Waiblinger, 2004) . Especially when there are few other possibilities to retreat from herd members, i.e. low space allowance, cows stand in cubicles to avoid encounters with others (Potter and Broom, 1987) and such behaviour seems to relate to lameness (Galindo and Broom, 2000) . Lameness and hoof lesions were more among cows that spent more time standing half in the cubicle. Reduced space allowance reduces the availability of resources for low-ranking individuals, especially in case of small alleys in cubicle houses (Konggaard, 1983) . Small alleys (< 1.6 m between cubicles) were associated with production losses in dairy cows (Ostergaard et al., 1986) . However, studies investigating alley width are scarce. Considering the requirement that at least two cows should be able to pass each other without (major) social disturbance, both physical space and social space interplay and show dependence on cow size. For example, the alley behind the feeding place would need to be at least as wide as a cow length plus 2 times cow width to theoretically enable cows during feeding time (when many cows are standing in the feeding place) to pass each other For today's cow size, this would mean at least 360 cm alley width behind the feeding place.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 351, "end": 367, "text": "(Wierenga, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1260"}, {"start": 368, "end": 395, "text": "Miller and Wood-Gush, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF763"}, {"start": 539, "end": 563, "text": "(Baars and Brands, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 714, "end": 730, "text": "(Wierenga, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1260"}, {"start": 731, "end": 754, "text": "Metz and Mekking, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF749"}, {"start": 755, "end": 776, "text": "Andreae et al., 1985;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 777, "end": 801, "text": "Metz and Wierenga, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF750"}, {"start": 802, "end": 821, "text": "Menke et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF738"}, {"start": 822, "end": 849, "text": "Fregonesi and Leaver, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF342"}, {"start": 890, "end": 912, "text": "(DeVries et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 913, "end": 933, "text": "Huzzey et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1123, "text": "(Wierenga, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1260"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1824, "text": "(DeVries et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1845, "text": "Huzzey et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2192, "text": "(Metz and Mekking, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF749"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2395, "text": "(M\u00fclleder and Waiblinger, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF784"}, {"start": 2559, "end": 2583, "text": "(Potter and Broom, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF895"}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2656, "text": "(Galindo and Broom, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF356"}, {"start": 2901, "end": 2918, "text": "(Konggaard, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF604"}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3039, "text": "(Ostergaard et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF853"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Effects of space allowance on welfare"}, {"text": "However the cows' need for social individual distance is not yet considered in this calculation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Effects of space allowance on welfare"}, {"text": "The design of the given space is very important.

These interactions seem to be a result of subordinate animals trying to get access to resources (Wierenga, 1990) . A number of studies have shown that, when the stocking is increased to more than one cow per cubicle, lying time decreases. The time of lying down shifts, especially for low ranking animals, the level of aggression increases and the occurrence of low ranking cows lying in the walking alleys increases (Friend et al. 1979; Wierenga, 1983 , Krohn & Konggard, 1987 Winckler et al. 2003; Fregonesi & Leaver, 2002; Fregonesi et al. 2007 ). Wierenga (1983) found an average reduction of lying time for all cows in the herd of 20 or 30 min with 10% or 20% overstocking, respectively. Low ranking animals again were more affected: lying time was reduced on average by 30 min to 80 min for this group. Similarly, Leonard et al. (1996) found that the average resting time when cows were housed at a cow/cubicle ratio of 2 was 7.5 hours but that this varied between 2.7 hours/day and 11.9 hours / day for individual cows. The low resting times were associated with an increase in the incidence of sole haemorrhages and lameness. Fregonesi et al. (2007) showed that the linear decline in lying times with overstocking was parallelled by a linear increase in time spent standing outside the cubicle. It seems likely that even moderate levels of overstocking can increase the risk of lameness. This is supported by results where a cubicle : cow ratio of less than 1,06 : 1 was associated with higher prevalence of lameness in multivariate analysis including 80 dairy herds (M\u00fclleder and Waiblinger, 2004) . Bowell et al. (2003) found a negative correlation (r = -0.51) between ratio of cubicles to cows and locomotion score in 22 herds. Additionally, overstocked cows are more likely to lie down immediately after returning from the parlour; when stocked at 1:1 ration cows feed for on average 40 min before lying down (Fregonesi et al., 2007a) ; this extra time standing is thought to allow for teat end closure reducing the risk of intramammary infection when cows to lie down. Further, overstocking may lead to low-ranking animals lying down in the alleys (Wierenga 1983 ). Understocking has positive effects with respect to those welfare aspects (lying duration, lying time, lameness); additionally the cows more often can adopt more comfortable lying positions more often (Wierenga et al., 1985; Keil et al., 2004) . Time spent lying was higher, cows lay down more synchronously, time spent standing in cubicles and in the walking areas was lower in a largely understocked situation (23 cubicles for 12 cows; Wierenga et al. 1985) . In the already mentioned epidemiological study of 80 cubicle housed dairy herds, understocking of cubicles (at least 6% more cubicles than cows) was associated with reduced prevalence of lameness (M\u00fclleder and Waiblinger 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 319, "text": "(Wierenga, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1261"}, {"start": 624, "end": 644, "text": "(Friend et al. 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 645, "end": 659, "text": "Wierenga, 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF1259"}, {"start": 660, "end": 684, "text": ", Krohn & Konggard, 1987", "ref_id": "BIBREF615"}, {"start": 685, "end": 706, "text": "Winckler et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1270"}, {"start": 707, "end": 732, "text": "Fregonesi & Leaver, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF342"}, {"start": 733, "end": 754, "text": "Fregonesi et al. 2007", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 758, "end": 773, "text": "Wierenga (1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1259"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1048, "text": "Leonard et al.

The amount of social agonistic interactions as well as feeding behaviour is related to both housing (feeding space per cow, design of the feed barrier) and feeding management (frequency and amount of food; restricted/ad libitum feeding) (Olofsson, 2000; Huzzey et al., 2006) . A reduced ratio of feeding places to animals or feeding space per animal increases agonistic behaviour in dairy cows, also when fed ad libitum (Stumpf et al., 2000; Schrader et al., 2002; M\u00fclleder et al., 2003; DeVries et al., 2004; Huzzey et al., 2006) and in feedlot steers (Corkum et al., 1994) . The increase of agonistic interactions during this enhanced competition is not equally distributed, but depends on the social strategy of the individual (M\u00fclleder et al., 2003) . Further, reduction in feeding space / places per cow causes shorter feeding times and longer times standing as well as changes in daily rhythm with increased time feeding during night (Olofsson, 1999; Schrader et al., 2002; Huzzey et al., 2006) . Cows are highly motivated to feed after a relatively short period of food deprivation (Sch\u00fctz et al., 2006) . More feeding space (1 m compared to 0.5 m) did not only reduce aggressive interactions (57% less) but also allowed dairy cows, especially subordinate animals, to increase feeding activity throughout the day, especially during the 90 min after providing fresh feed (increase of 24%) (DeVries et al., 2004) and thus providing also low ranking cows access to the best quality food. With reduction in feed trough space (0.81, 0.61, 0.41, 0.21 m/ cow or 1.33, 1.0, 0.66, 0.33 headlocks per cow) a linear decrease in time standing inactively in the feeding area, a curvilinear increase in displacement from the feeding area and curvilinear decrease in time feeding is observed (Huzzey at al. 2006) . The competition at the feed trough in general depends on the whole system and thus on how synchronised the animals are in feeding, e.g. in automatic milking systems with (partially) forced cow traffic, competition may be relaxed. However, cows are highly motivated to start feeding after fresh food is supplied and even partially forced cow traffic seems to impair welfare compared with conventional systems (Hagen et al. 2005) . The effect of feeder space per animal will depend on how synchronised the animals are in feeding. In a robotic milker, there is little feeding synchrony and so competition for access to roughage is lower than when fresh TMR is delivered once a day. The effects of too little feeder space will also be greater if there are too few lying stalls or if the time taken for milking is long and there is less time available to feed and rest. As mentioned above, parallel overstocking in the lying area may enhance the problem as may long duration of milking so that cows have less time left for resting and feeding.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 145, "text": "(Miller and Wood-Gush, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF763"}, {"start": 241, "end": 265, "text": "(Boe and Faerevik, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 505, "end": 521, "text": "(Olofsson, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF843"}, {"start": 522, "end": 542, "text": "Huzzey et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 688, "end": 709, "text": "(Stumpf et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1089"}, {"start": 710, "end": 732, "text": "Schrader et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1014"}, {"start": 733, "end": 755, "text": "M\u00fclleder et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF784"}, {"start": 756, "end": 777, "text": "DeVries et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 778, "end": 798, "text": "Huzzey et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 821, "end": 842, "text": "(Corkum et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1021, "text": "(M\u00fclleder et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF784"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1224, "text": "(Olofsson, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF842"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1247, "text": "Schrader et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1014"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1268, "text": "Huzzey et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1378, "text": "(Sch\u00fctz et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1020"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1685, "text": "(DeVries et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 2052, "end": 2072, "text": "(Huzzey at al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 2483, "end": 2502, "text": "(Hagen et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF418"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Feeding space / feeding place to animal ratio / drinker space"}, {"text": "The drinker also can be a place for high competition and thus a source for aggressive interactions.

Consequently, animal temperature regulation starts with change of sensible and latent heat loss (e.g. through the skin) and, if necessary, due to higher environmental temperature more of the total heat must be lost as latent. When ambient temperatures exceed deep body temperatures all heat must be dissipated as latent.

The proportion of resting time spent lying by Hereford cows has been reported to be 0.55 (Dwyer, 1961) to 0.83 (Wagnon, 1963) , with no obvious differences between the seasons (Herbel and Nelson, 1966; Kropp et al., 1973) . Dwyer (1961) found that during the night most rest was carried out while lying down, whereas during the day climatic factors had stronger influence on proportion of lying while resting. In a study on beef cattle the proportion of resting time spent lying down decreased with increased temperature, especially when humidity was high (Larkin, 1954) . In warm climate Aberdeen Angus cows were found to always rest in shade during the day, whereas Brahman cattle did not (Rhoad, 1938 , see separate chapter). Growing beef steers lay down for longer as the temperature decreases and in very cold climate cattle lie more with increasing wind speed, presumably to reduce heat loss (Malechek and Smith, 1976) . When there is a milder winter condition, cattle have been found to have a larger proportion of their resting time standing than in summer (Rutter, 1968) .

The time dairy cows are lying has been found to vary from 6.7 to 14.7 h with the shortest durations being found on pasture and the longest durations on straw yards or deep bedded packs (Table 5 ). There are no obvious differences in lying time in tie stalls compared to cubicle systems. In cubicle systems the total time spent lying is affected by many aspects of stall design (dimensions), floor and type of bedding etc. Cook et al., 2004; Drissler et al., 2005) . In tie stalls, lying time can be reduced by hard flooring (Haley et al., 2001) . Lying times can also be longer if cattle are lame (Singh et al., 1993b; O'Callaghan et al., 2003; Juarez et al., 2003 ; see chapter 14.5.2). Presence of cows in heat has been found to reduce lying time and increase number of lying bouts (Sambraus, 1971; Beneke, 1985) . Typically, dairy cows lie down from 6-13 times a day in bouts that last on average 55-90 mins (Haley et al., 2001; Manninen et al., 2002; Tucker et al., 2004; Drissler et al., 2005 , Rushen et al., 2007 Norring et al., 2008) . Wechsler et al. (2000) found that individual cows were lying down 10-17 times per day. This number was 12-13 on average on different soft surfaces (soft comfort mats or straw mattress) with bout length ranging from 43-73 min for individual cows, and 53-67min on average on different mattresses. Cattle can lie down in a number of postures that can be classified according to the position of their legs and head (Schnitzer, 1971) . Haley et al. (2000) examined resting postures of cows in large pens with a soft floor. Most of the time the front legs were tucked under the cow. The front legs were extended for only 7% of the time. In contrast, the back legs were tucked under the cows for only 21% of the time. For 90% of the resting time, the head was held up, supported by the neck. The remainder of the time, the head was resting against the ground or against the cows' body. The type of stall provided may prevent cows adopting certain of these postures, although Haley et al. (2000) found no evidence that this was true for the tie-stalls examined. However, Oertli et al. (1994) found that cows extended the lower hind leg longer on soft surfaces than on hard surfaces and in cubicles Oertli et al. (1995) found 10,2 -13,8 % of lying time with front legs extended. Cubicle width in relation to cow size influences lying position so that larger cows (height at withers >1,45 cm) show less often comfortable lying positions with outstretched hind legs compared with smaller cows (Keil et al., 2004) .When understocked (1,5 : 1 cubicle : cow) cows more often adopt more comfortable lying positions (Wierenga et al., 1985) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 583, "end": 601, "text": "Cook et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 602, "end": 624, "text": "Drissler et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 685, "end": 705, "text": "(Haley et al., 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 758, "end": 779, "text": "(Singh et al., 1993b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1039"}, {"start": 780, "end": 805, "text": "O'Callaghan et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF828"}, {"start": 806, "end": 825, "text": "Juarez et al., 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF548"}, {"start": 945, "end": 961, "text": "(Sambraus, 1971;", "ref_id": "BIBREF983"}, {"start": 962, "end": 975, "text": "Beneke, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1092, "text": "(Haley et al., 2001;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1115, "text": "Manninen et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF695"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1136, "text": "Tucker et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1134"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1158, "text": "Drissler et al., 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1180, "text": ", Rushen et al., 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF332"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1202, "text": "Norring et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF821"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1227, "text": "Wechsler et al.

In a study on tied dairy cows and heifers the majority of the animals were lying from 19.00 to 04.00 and from 11.00 to 12.00 ( Figure 10 ). The heifers were even more synchronised in their lying, probably because they were not influenced by milking. However, Haley et al. (2000) found no strong evidence of diurnal rhythms in the cows' activity when in tie-stalls, with cows lying down during the light hours as much as during the dark hours ( Figure 11 ). No more than 60% of any hour of the day was spent in lying down, showing that, at any time of the day, a substantial number of cows were standing up. Thus, the degree to which cattle are synchronised in their lying times is highly variable and is strongly affected by management. In fact, robotic milking systems rely on dairy cows not being completely synchronised in their lying behaviour. The degree of synchrony depends on the availability of resources. When less feeding space or cubicles exist, cows shift feeding/lying time but they do not if enough feed/lying space is available (for more information see chapter on social space).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 469, "text": "Haley et al.

The motivation for lying in dairy cattle has been investigated in several experiments. In a study by Ruckebush (1974) cows were deprived of both feeding and lying (by use of a rope harness), except for a period of 4 h per day when they could do both. Initially, feeding appeared to be the priority behaviour with the cows spending most of the 4 h period feeding and very little time lying down. As the treatments continued however, the speed of eating was increased so that feeding time decreased, allowing the cattle to spend more time lying down. In another study, Metz (1985) prevented cattle from lying down for 3 hours each morning by placing them on slatted floors, and found that the amount of time lying in the subsequent period was increased, indicating that the cattle did attempt to compensate for the reduced lying time. In a second experiment the animals were also prevented from feeding for the same 3-hour period (Metz, 1985) . When the cows had not been prevented from lying down, the feeding deprivation resulted in a significant reduction in lying time during the subsequent 3hour period, because the animals were eating. However, when the cattle had been prevented from lying, the feeding deprivation did not result in a reduction in lying time during the subsequent period.

These results support the suggestions of Metz (1985) that lying time has a higher priority than eating. It has also been shown that the motivation to lie down in heifers increased with deprivation of lying time (Jensen et al., 2004a) . Jensen et al. (2005) found that pregnant heifers were prepared to make an effort to lie down for 12-13 h/d suggesting that this is the average preferred resting time. Lying bouts longer than 20 mins also seem to be preferred to shorter bouts. Together these studies show that dairy cows are highly motivated to lie down for a considerable period of time and that lying down can take priority over feeding. The results indicate that cattle protect lying times and compensate for reduced resting times.

In one study, lactating dairy cows were prevented from lying down for 2 periods of 7 h each day by the use of a specially designed harness. This resulted in reduced concentrations of growth hormone (Munksgaard and L\u00f8vendahl, 1993) . Munksgaard and Simonsen (1996) noted that deprivation of resting behaviour in cows resulted in increased grooming, and tended to increase the incidence of licking the pen equipment. Although the duration of eating and ruminating was not affected, feeding tended to occur in more but shorter bouts and more rumination occurred while the animal was standing rather than lying down. Reduced concentrations of growth hormone (GRT), cortisol and ACTH, nor the cortisol response to ACTH were affected (Munksgaard and L\u00f8vendahl, 1993) . In a similar experiment with growing bulls, deprivation of resting time did not affect basal cortisol or ACTH concentrations but tended to reduce cortisol and ACTH responses to CRF injections 3 days after treatment and increase cortisol responses to ACTH injections after 53 days of treatment . Behavioural changes were also noted: use of the harnesses did not affect the total time spent eating or ruminating, but ruminating occurred in more frequent and presumably shorter bouts, mainly while the animal was standing. There was also an increase in the occurrence of licking and chewing the pen fixtures and an increase in the frequency of grooming. Overall, there was an increased frequency of transitions between behaviours, which the authors interpreted as due to frustration . Fisher et al. (2002) prevented cows from lying down for a single 15 h period each day by using a harness that delivered a slight electrical shock each time the cow attempted to lie down. This reduced the time that the cows lay down from 8.1 hours per day to less than 4 hours per day.

Cattle get up and lie down in a quite stereotyped pattern of movements ( Figure 12 ). Before starting to lie down the cow walks slowly forward sniffing the ground, probably searching for a suitable lying place. The actual process of lying down occurs in a series of three movements: cows begin by bending the front legs, then fall onto the front knees, and finally let their abdomen and hindquarters fall sideward. As a last movement cow moves the front legs a bit forward allowing the belly a firm in contact with the ground. On pasture dairy cows usually have no problems with lying down and it is mostly accomplished within some seconds (Lidfors, 1989) . However, in tie stalls they may have problems to lie down due to bad design of the tethers (Mortensen, 1971) , the manger edge being too high (Hoffman and Rist, 1975; Metzner, 1978) , too short stalls (Hoffman and Rist, 1975) or a neck bow being in the way (Hoffman and Rist, 1975) . When dairy cows have problems in lying down this will usually take much longer time, and it has been found that it took up to an hour from when the cow started to sniff on the floor until she was lying (Muller et al., 1989) . Ladewig and von Borell (1988) found that it took 9 s from the first intention to lie down until the cow was lying on deep straw and 59 min in tethered cows. When cattle have problems lying down they may also have more interruptions before finally lying and fewer numbers of lying down (Kohli, 1987) . Once they are lying they seem to compensate these problems by lying for a longer time (Mortensen, 1971) . During the normal process of lying down, much of the weight of the cow is placed on her front knees. Hard floors in tie-stalls and in cubicles can lead to knee injuries, which make lying down painful (Rushen et al., 2007b) . This will reduce the willingness of cows to lie down, which is apparent in a decreased frequency of bouts of lying down followed by an increase in the duration of bouts of standing (Haley et al., 2001) . In cubicle housing the design of the cubicle can have detrimental effects on the cow's way of lying down (Koch, 1968; Sambraus, 1971; K\u00e4mmer and Schnitzer, 1975; K\u00e4mmer and Tschanz, 1975; Oester, 1978; K\u00e4mmer, 1980; K\u00e4mmer, 1981) .

For a more detailed description see Nickel et al. (1986) and Phillips (2002) . Flower et al. (2005) have recently used kinematics to describe the walk of dairy cows. The amount of time that three hooves are on the ground appears to be an important variable related to lameness (Flower et al., 2007) . It is desired that cattle walk with feet and legs straight. It is especially undesirable if lactating cows have their rear feet pointed outwards because the hocks then tend to point inward and then may rub against the udder (Albright and Arave, 1997) . Some traits of dairy cows, for example weak pasterns, hocks with too much or not enough set, shallow heels and toes that spread, may change the cows gait and eventually lead to lameness (see Chapter 14). The presence of milk in the udder can also affect gait (Webster, 1993; .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 141, "text": "(Nickel et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF809"}, {"start": 144, "end": 164, "text": "Flower et al.

When indoors, cattle can be fed conserved grass (silage), dried cereal grain (concentrate) or total mixed ration. With this feeding regime it is possible to increase the cows' total intake of nutrients over what she can accomplish on only grass, and thus ensure that she gets enough nutrition to produce the high amount of milk she has been bred to produce. Higher milk production can be achieved with controlled grain feeding . This will in the long run ensure that the dairy cow does not lack energy, and loose body condition due to the milk production. Cows on pasture tend to produce less milk and eat a different diet than cows without access to pasture . However, in some parts of the world, i.e. Australia and New Zealand, it appears possible to get a fairly high milk production from dairy cows that only feed from the pasture.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 210, "text": "(Phillips, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF881"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Why are dairy cows not kept on pasture?"}, {"text": "Over the last decades robotic milking systems have been developed and spread throughout Europe (section 11.1.3). These make it more difficult to keep the cows on pasture, because an individual cow has to take a decision to walk back to the milking parlour at regular intervals without being synchronised with the rest of the herd. It has been shown that dairy cows do not walk all the way out to pasture when it is too far from the milking robot, but rather lie down in the passage ways out to pasture, probably so that the distance they have to walk back will not become too large (Sp\u00f6rndly and Wredle, 2004) .

Summer access to pasture has been found to reduce mortality of dairy cows in Denmark (Thomsen et al. 2006; Thomsen et al., 2007) . A number of epidemiological or experimental studies in different countries have found that lactating cows without access to pasture suffer from a higher incidence of a variety of health problems including mastitis (Bendixen et al., 1986b; Bendixen et al., 1988a; Waage et al., 1998; Barkema et al., 1999a; Washburn et al., 2002; White et al., 2002) , tramped teats (Ekesbo, 1966; Geer and Grommers, 1975; Bendixen et al., 1986b) , metritis (Bruun et al., 2002) , Salmonella enterica infections (Veling et al., 2002) , dystocia (Bendixen at al, 1986a) , retained placenta (Bendixen et al., 1987a) and ketosis (Bendixen et al., 1987c) . Hock and knee injuries are also more common when cows have no or limited access to pasture (Haskell et al., 2006 , Rutherford et al., 2008 . Thus, zero-grazing can be considered to increase the likelihood of all of these health problems. In a large epidemiological study on Swedish dairy cows where tied cows were compared when tied and when kept on pasture during summer time with loose housed cows with no summer pasture (Bendixen et al., 1986a; 1987a; 1987b; 1987c; there were no significant effects of access to pasture on the relative likelihood of parturient paresis (Bendixen et al., 1987b) or tramped teats (Bendixen et al., 1988b) . However, tramped teats have been found to be lower in cows on pasture in other studies (Ekesbo, 1966; Geer and Grommers, 1975; Bendixen et al., 1986b) . The reason for not finding an effect in the study by Bendixen et al. (1988b) may be due to many other factors having a greater influence on the chance of tramped teats than pasture. Washburn et al. (2002) reported that cows without access to pasture had 1.8 times as many clinical cases of mastitis and were 8 times more likely to be culled for mastitis in comparison to cows at pasture. The studies do not allow us to identify the actual cause of the difference but providing cows with access to an exercise area or dry-lot does not seem sufficient (Bruun et al., 2002; Washburn et al., 2002) . Green et al (2008a) found the chance of having non-ambulatory cattle to be 4 times higher when the predominant flooring area was not pasture compared to when it was pasture. Another important aspect of giving dairy cows access to pasture is that they get vitamin D through the radiation of the skin. Vitamin D is the principal regulator of calcium homeostasis, and is important in skeletal development and bone mineralization, as well as for cell proliferation and the immune system (Horts et al., 1994; Holick, 2003; Mikkelsen, 2006) . It has been found that solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation can supply the body with up to 80-100% of its requirements of vitamin D (Pfeifer et al., 2002) . It is the UV radiation with wavelengths between 290 and 315 nm that can penetrate the epidermis and photochemically initiates the vitamin D 3 synthesis (Mikkelsen, 2006) . In pasture-grazed dairy cows with no supplementation of vitamin D there was a seasonal variation of vitamin D 3 in the milk with the maximum level being reached during the summer period (Kurmann and Indyk, 1994) . Flachowsky et al. (1993) found that the duration of sunshine and the UV intensity influenced the plasma concentration of vitamin D in cows. However, in the northern hemisphere the sun may not be able to supply cows being out-doors during the winter time with enough vitamin D, as required on some organic farms where D vitamins are not given in the feed. On two Danish farms it was found that the dairy cows on one farm managed a winter season without critically low vitamin D concentrations, where as most cows on the second farm had vitamin D status below normal at the end of the winter (Mikkelsen, 2006) . In the early months of spring the solar radiation could, to some extent supply the cows with vitamin D (Mikkelsen, 2006) . Access to summer pasture will, however, give the dairy cows enough solar UV radiation to carry out endogenous syntheis of vitamin D 3 in the skin (Horst et al., 1994 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 190, "text": "(Thomsen et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1120"}, {"start": 191, "end": 212, "text": "Thomsen et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1121"}, {"start": 429, "end": 453, "text": "(Bendixen et al., 1986b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 454, "end": 477, "text": "Bendixen et al., 1988a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 478, "end": 497, "text": "Waage et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1190"}, {"start": 498, "end": 520, "text": "Barkema et al., 1999a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 521, "end": 543, "text": "Washburn et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1214"}, {"start": 544, "end": 563, "text": "White et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1254"}, {"start": 580, "end": 594, "text": "(Ekesbo, 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF301"}, {"start": 595, "end": 619, "text": "Geer and Grommers, 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF366"}, {"start": 620, "end": 643, "text": "Bendixen et al., 1986b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 655, "end": 675, "text": "(Bruun et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 709, "end": 730, "text": "(Veling et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1177"}, {"start": 742, "end": 765, "text": "(Bendixen at al, 1986a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 786, "end": 810, "text": "(Bendixen et al., 1987a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 823, "end": 847, "text": "(Bendixen et al., 1987c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 941, "end": 962, "text": "(Haskell et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF448"}, {"start": 963, "end": 988, "text": ", Rutherford et al., 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF975"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1297, "text": "(Bendixen et al., 1986a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1304, "text": "1987a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1311, "text": "1987b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1318, "text": "1987c;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1447, "text": "(Bendixen et al., 1987b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1489, "text": "(Bendixen et al., 1988b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1593, "text": "(Ekesbo, 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF301"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1618, "text": "Geer and Grommers, 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF366"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1642, "text": "Bendixen et al., 1986b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1721, "text": "Bendixen et al.

A large epidemiological survey of 4 516 dairy farms in the US, found that a lack of access to pasture in winter was a significant risk factor for a high incidence of digital dermatitis, and that providing access to a dry-lot was not sufficient to overcome this (Wells et al., 1999) . Nearly four times as many farms on which cows had no access to pasture had a high (>5%) incidence of dermatitis than farms on which cows were kept only on pasture (Wells et al., 1999) . A smaller study in Chile (Rodriguez-Lainz et al., 1999) found supporting results: cattle housed permanently at pasture had a lower probability of developing digital dermatitis than cows housed in buildings for some of the year. This suggests that occasional or seasonal exposure to confinement housing may be as important as the complete absence of grazing. In countries as large as the US and Chile, the type of housing used varies greatly depending on the region, and climatic differences could conceivably account for some of the effects of housing. However, similar effects of a lack of grazing have been noted in smaller countries, which do not have such climatic variation. An epidemiological survey of 86 dairy farms in the Netherlands (Somers et al., 2003) reported that all types of hoof disorders were more prevalent in cows in zero-grazing systems than among cows with some access to pasture. Again, the difference was substantial: the prevalence of severe cases of sole haemorrhage was twice as high with zero-grazing compared to other housing systems. Even where cows had some seasonal access to pasture, hoof disorders (but not digital dermatitis) were more prevalent during the period of indoor housing compared to the end of the period of summer access to pasture. In Kenya, where some dairy farmers use zero-grazing, the prevalence of lameness is lower in farms where cows have some access to pasture (Gitau et al., 1996) . A survey of 37 farms in the UK found a higher prevalence of lameness in cows that could not graze compared to cows that have some ability to graze (prevalence of 39% versus 15%) as well as a higher frequency of swollen knees (Haskell et al., 2006) . In Switzerland, the odds ratio for a cow being lame was higher in cows kept in tie stalls with no winter access to pasture compared to cows kept in tie stalls with continuous access to pasture (Regula et al., 2004) . Recent work indicates that even a short period of access to pasture can reduce lameness. When a matched sample of cows were either kept in a free-stall barn or moved out onto pasture, cows on pasture showed a dramatic improvement in gait just over four weeks of exposure (Hernandez-Mendo et al., 2007) . However, some studies report an increased occurrence of digital dermatitis (Holzauer et al. 2006) Although these studies indicate that lameness and hoof problems of various sorts are less common for cattle with some access to pasture, they do not allow us to isolate the cause of this difference. Cows in indoor housing are more likely to be standing in manure and on concrete, and eating more grain than cows at pasture, all of which increase the likelihood of lameness (see Chapter 14).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 389, "text": "(Wells et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1236"}, {"start": 555, "end": 575, "text": "(Wells et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1236"}, {"start": 603, "end": 633, "text": "(Rodriguez-Lainz et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF946"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1342, "text": "(Somers et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1054"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2016, "text": "(Gitau et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF371"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2266, "text": "(Haskell et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF448"}, {"start": 2462, "end": 2483, "text": "(Regula et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF925"}, {"start": 2757, "end": 2787, "text": "(Hernandez-Mendo et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF478"}, {"start": 2865, "end": 2887, "text": "(Holzauer et al. 2006)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Effect of access to pasture on lameness"}, {"text": "Cattle at pasture are not all free of welfare problems. Cattle at pasture can be exposed to inclement weather, increased parasite load, flies and gad-flies, inadequate energy intake, toxic plants and high competition for feed if stocking rates are too high. In many regions of the world cattle are housed continuously on pasture and must meet their nutritional requirements through the consumption of native herbages. Although, this provides a \u2017natural' diet and freedom of movement, risks to animal welfare arise when either the availability or quality of the grass is low. Even brief periods of feed deprivation cause some hunger in cows (Schutz et al., 2006) . Longer-term effects of inadequate food intake include lost body weight and body condition (Stockdale, 2001) .

Cows can lose body condition and weight especially after calving when kept on pasture, which can be a cause for concern (Fontanelli et al., 2005) . Poor body condition can also increase the risk of disease such as milk fever (Roche and Berry, 2006) . Furthermore, the use of some forms of grass at pasture can increase the chance of sub-acute ruminal acidosis (O'Grady et al., 2008) .

Farms vary greatly in how much access to grazing the cows have. In some systems, cows are kept at pasture all the time. In others they have access at certain times e.g. during the summer or during the day. In true zero-grazing systems, cows have no access to pasture at all. Thus, it is needed to know whether the effects on animal welfare are due to the complete absence of access to pasture or the occasional use of indoor housing. Furthermore, zero-grazing systems differ from pasture-based systems in many respects. For example, air quality, the types of surface on which the cows walk and lie down, the stocking rates used and even light/dark cycles may be different. It is difficult to determine which of these factors may be responsible for any difference in welfare. Furthermore, there is always the possibility that some modification of indoor housing systems (e.g. using a different type of ventilation or flooring) would raise the welfare of cows in zero-grazing systems to a similar or higher level than found at pasture. For these reasons, any results concerning the effect of grazing on the welfare of cattle must be interpreted with care. It should not to be assumed that providing cows with access to pasture will automatically improve their welfare, or that a high level of animal welfare cannot be achieved in zero-grazing systems .

Unrestricted and painless locomotion is crucial for cows in loose houses to successfully satisfy their biological and social needs (Metz and Bracke, 2003) . Floors can have a significant impact on claw and leg disorders. A floor should meet requirements concerning hardness, roughness and slipperiness (Nilsson, 1992) . Moreover, the surface of the floor should be clean and dry (Bergsten, 2001) . The hardness of the walking alleys determines the load on legs, joints and claws. Cows have a preference for softer walking alleys. Softer walking surfaces promote free locomotion due to the fact that the claws have a better contact with the floor. Rough floors lead to an unbalance between growth and wearing off the horn of the claws. Moreover, rough floors lead to high pressure points on the sole of the claw. The slipperiness of a floor can be expressed with a friction coefficient. The friction coefficient is expressed in Leroux values. Floors with a Leroux value between 50 and 70 promote locomotion.

The difference from conventional milking is that this attachment may fail and for the four cups together it takes substantially more time than in the case of manual attachment in conventional milking (Artmann, 1997) . But this difference seems to cause no real problem for the cow. From what happens if a cow is sucked by a calf, no rule appears that says that all teats must be milked completely synchronously. Another difference with conventional milking is that in robotic milking after the milk stream of a teat comes to a minimum, the teat cup is taken away independently from the other teat cups and their milk flow level. It diminishes the so-called vacuum milking on teats and thus reduces the risk of mastitis (Neijenhuis et al. 2008) . The yield of the udder quarters, especially between fore teats and rear teats, will always differ (Hogewerf and Ipema, 2000) .

If exceeding their maximum interval, cows will be fetched by the farmer so that the aimed minimum milking frequency per day still can be maintained. Timely visiting the milking robot is a complicated task for cows. First of all, milking itself does not motivate cows to go to the robot. In some way cows have to be enforced or specifically rewarded. A common way is to create a certain logistic routing in the barn, so that cows have to pass the robot station obligatory on their way from the resting to the feeding area (so-called \u2017forced' cow traffic). Another approach is to provide all or a main part of the daily concentrates ration exclusively in the robot station. Because of their eagerness to eat concentrates, cows are likely to visit the robot station at least for the required number of milking times per day. As a rule, attendance of the robot station is followed by a gift of concentrates and actual milking, if the minimum time interval since the last milking has passed, e.g. 6 hours. Cows not visiting the robot station on time (within the set time limit), even with concentrates availability, will by consequence, be fetched. This causes extra labour for the stockman, and often unrest in the herd. Between \u2017forced' cow traffic and voluntary visiting the robot, other models of cow traffic are researched (e.g. Hermans et al., 2003) .

The presence or absence of social companions has major effects on various physiological and behavioural responses in animals and the presence of, or interactions with these individuals, appear to moderate the impact of environmental stressors (Dantzer, 1990; Veissier et al., 1998) . Stress responses in challenging situations may be ameliorated by the presence of (familiar) conspecifics (Boissy and Le Neindre, 1990) showing that heifers are less likely to avoid an unusual noise in the presence of pen-mates. During exposure to a novel arena, heifers seem also less afraid of the situation when they are with social partners than when they are alone (Veissier and Le Neindre, 1992) . The efficiency of such support depends on the familiarity or the specific relationship of the individuals and in some species only bonding partners can give social support (Sachser et al., 1998) . In cattle, behavioural and physiological (heart rate) stress responses of heifers in different challenging situations were lower when pen-mates were present compared to the presence of animals of another group (Takeda et al., 2003) . The number of social partners also was influential: social buffering was highest, i.e. stress responses were lowest, in a group of five familiar (and probably bonded) animals compared to a group of two (Takeda et al., 2003) . Dairy cows showed less behavioural signs of stress (no flinch, no vocalisation, less vigilance) when in an arena separated from the herd with a bonded herd mate compared to being with a non-bonded herd mate and animals also stayed closer to and licked more the bonded cow than the non-bonded (Waiblinger et al., 2006) . There are also hints on long-term positive effects on health and production when social bonding partners are available. Fewer cows with one or more constantly available bonding partner(s) over a period of several months were lame compared to cows without a constant bonding partner (11% vs. 36%) (Waiblinger et al., 2006) .

Increased amount of fighting and (sudden) withdrawal may also enhance the risk of claw lesions due to heavy pressure on claws, quick claw movements and slipping. Animals also show changes in their maintenance behaviours, physiological stress responses and decrease in milk yield in response to grouping. Grouped animals stood more, had shorter lying bouts and grazed shorter for up to two weeks (Hasegawa et al., 1997; Phillips and Rind, 2001) , and had markedly lower lying time at the first day after grouping (Knierim, 1998; Knierim, 1999) . Boe and Faerevik (2003) report studies showing negative effects on feed intake and weight. Milk production decreased for days to several weeks after grouping (Arave and Albright, 1976; Brakel and Leis, 1976; Hasegawa et al., 1997; Phillips and Rind, 2001) , although some authors did report no change in milk yield (Clark et al., 1977; Collis et al., 1979) .

Pasture not only offers more space to evade dominant animals, but also often better conditions to prevent claw lesions.

In contrast, in a dehorned dairy herd (Knierim, 1998; Knierim, 1999) found no significant difference in agonistic interactions, although heifers introduced singly had more social interactions with the herd members compared to heifers introduced in a group of three. However, there was a hint that single-heifers may have been more stressed compared to group-heifers: 4 single heifers (of 8) failed to feed at the first day due to the type of feeding rack which was new for the heifers, but all except one group-heifer (out of 15) succeeded.

However, introducing heifers in late pregnancy into a cow herd of different stages of lactation may have different effects and there might be the risk for premature parturition.

Generally, the ability to cope with social challenge may largely be influenced by differerences between individuals in how they perceive and respond to the current social conditions, influenced largely by former experiences (Mendl, 2001) . In a herd of beef suckler cows (M\u00fclleder et al., 2003) and in a dairy cow herd individual animals were found to differ in their social strategies and probably social stress. During enhanced food competition (reduced ratio of feeding places to animals), the different strategies of the groups differed in the amount of agonistic interactions (M\u00fclleder et al., 2003) . Especially experiences during early life may disrupt or enhance the development of appropriate social skills (Sachser et al., 1998) to deal with the challenges of living in a social group. Influences of early rearing (individually vs. group) on the later social behaviour of calves or heifers when mixed with each other were found mostly in agonistic interactions and social status achieved (Warnick et al., 1977; Broom and Leaver, 1978; Le Neindre and Sourd, 1984; Arave et al., 1985; Veissier et al., 1994) .

There are hints that the common practice of early separation of calf and dam and housing calves individually for the first weeks of life can hamper the social skills later in life (Boe and Faerevik, 2003) .

However, this preferred lying time can be compromised in the high yielding dairy cow if the required energy and dry matter intakes are not met through poor provision of rations or prolonged periods of restricted access to either food or lying area. Lying times can also decrease due to factors such as use of cubicle housing and cubicle comfort, high stocking rates and recent calving. Severely lame cows prefer to lie down for longer amounts of time per day, but moderately lame cows have been shown to stand for less time (Cook et al., 2004) . Furthermore, the time spent lying down was concentrated in a smaller number of prolonged bouts. Cook et al. (2004 Cook et al.

Stresses associated with standing on concrete can be reduced by improving cow comfort and increasing lying time by housing cows on straw or other soft bedding such as peat or sand (Bergsten and Herlin, 1996) , improving cubicle comfort to increase lying time, or by covering the concrete walkways with asphalt or rubber to improve the quality of the walking surface (Vanegas et al., 2006; Kremer et al., 2007) .

This however is too crude a measure of risk since it can involve many tangible hazards that can increase external stresses on the foot and/or reduce resilience to these stresses. Onset of lactation (especially first lactation) may coincide with a substantial increase in time spent standing on concrete. At the same time, the cow experiences major endocrinological changes and is provided with a substantially enriched diet. Increased time spent standing on concrete, especially in early lactation when the resilience of the support mechanism within the feet is impaired, presents a more severe hazard than feeding for lactation (Knott et al., 2007) . However since the connective tissue changes in the foot are relatively brief unless exacerbated y bad housing, the incidence of CHD can be radically reduced by keeping cows off concrete for the first 8 weeks of lactation (Webster, 2001; Webster, 2002) A further group of hazards relates to the quality of foot care. These include appropriate trimming of healthy claws to create a functionally sound hoof prior to calving, and the ability of the stockman to detect promptly and treat effectively any sole haemorrhage or ulceration.

Optimisation of the hygienic procedures in the barn and in the milking parlour combined with the optimal immune status of the cow will make it difficult for the pathogens to cause an intramammary infection. In addition, the overall management of transition cows influences the risk of clinical mastitis post partum, as well as the risk of many other health disorders. Overall management of dry cows includes factors such as controlled and nutritionally balanced feed intake, hygienic housing, minimised stress and proper calving assistance when needed. The dry (non-lactating) period of the cow is of great importance in the dynamics of intramammary infections (Neave et al., 1950; Totdhunter et al., 1991; Green et al., 2002a) . Susceptibility of the bovine mammary gland to infection during the dry period is considered to be greatest in the days after drying off and in the 3 weeks before calving (Bradley and Green, 2004) . Intramammary infections that are present during the dry period can be divided into those that were carried into the dry period form the previous lactation (existing infections), and those that enter between the time of drying off and calving (new infections) (Bradley and Green, 2004) . The probability of a new dry-period infection is influenced by the rate of exposure to pathogens (e.g., from the environment), factors that affect an individual cow's susceptibility to infection (Dingwell et al., 2004) , and the effectiveness of protection from medical interventions such as antibiotic dry-cow therapy or teat sealants Berry and Hillerton, 2002; Robert et al., 2006) . Compared with an uninfected mammary gland, glands infected during the dry period are at greater risk of clinical mastitis during the next lactation (Bradley and Green, 2000; Green et al., 2002a) . Furthermore, clinical mastitis in cows with an intramammary infection in the previous dry period occurs at a faster rate after calving than in uninfected cows during the dry period (Green et al., 2002a) .

The most important factors of poor welfare in cows are those described by Broom (2003) for transported cattle. In particular, loading and unloading can be stressful for cattle (Hartung et al. 2000) . Too high a stocking density, the mixing of animals of different origins, rough and unfriendly handling, poor driving, too high or too low temperature and humidity and too long a duration of the transport journey can lead to stress, aggression, fear, injuries and fatigue (Holleben von et al 2003) . Any of these factors in cattle can also be associated with typical infectious diseases such as shipping fever, caused by several infectious agents like Pasteurella and some viruses (Storz et al. 2000) . It seems that stress and reduced welfare can enhance the susceptibility for infection by lowering the infection threshold, or the amount of pathogen needed to initiate an infection in an animal or overwhelm the immune defence system. The effects of transport are of considerable importance for dairy cow welfare not only because of the acute or delayed effects on the animal being transported but also marketing and transport of cows and bulls are important ways in which many infectious diseases may be disseminated to dairy herds and then in turn increase the incidence and prevalence of disease and poor welfare in those herds (see for example Green et al. 2008b and EFSA, 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 298, "text": "11 March, 2002", "ref_id": "BIBREF1002"}, {"start": 516, "end": 528, "text": "Broom (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 618, "end": 639, "text": "(Hartung et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF444"}, {"start": 913, "end": 938, "text": "(Holleben von et al 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF503"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1141, "text": "(Storz et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1084"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1813, "text": "Green et al. 2008b and", "ref_id": "BIBREF395"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1825, "text": "EFSA, 2004)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cow marketing and local movements of animals"}, {"text": "Although of great importance, in this report such effects have not been further described.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cow marketing and local movements of animals"}, {"text": "Whenever possible cattle tend to withdraw from the herd when injured or sick.

Signs of pain are evident after caustic paste (4 week old) (Stilwell, 2008a) or heat cauterization (8 week old) for 4 hours. Animals disbudded by heat cauterization tended to exhibit weaker reactions (different ages). Local anaesthesia induced a strong reduction of reactions in 60% of animals in both treatments (Morise et al., 1995) .

This number increased from 2% in 1960 to over 4% by 1982. Whilst some of this effect could be due to a more rigorous culling policy most is likely to be a consequence of a genetic change in the cows. Subsequent data on this issue are provided by Thomsen (2006) and other data sets are described in several chapters of this report which indicate that the major causes of early mortality in dairy cows have increased more rapidly since 1983. It would seem that increased metabolic pressure on the cow is associated with more reproductive problems and reduced life expectancy (Roxstrom 2001) . Much of the evidence refers to higher culling rates but the reason for culling is almost always that the animal has difficulties in coping with its environment so its welfare is poor. Herd-level mortality statistics can be calculated easily in the same way as disease incidence rates or risks. In this case, the outcome of interest is death. Mortality can be calculated for different animal categories separately, e.g. calves <6 months or first-lactation cows. Overall mortality describes the rate or risk of death regardless of its cause. Cause-specific mortality instead describes mortality due to specific causes, e.g. low production, infertility or certain diseases. Sometimes farmer records of reasons for culling exist and can be used for causespecific mortality statistics. The rate or risk of spontaneous death can be described accordingly.

However, knowledge alone is not enough. This knowledge and understanding must be communicated to, and implemented by those who have direct responsibility for care of the animals. It is also necessary to define standards and inform retailers and consumers seeking quality assurance in matters of animal welfare. In order to ensure compliance with welfare standards on individual farms, within farming systems, or within market-led quality assurance schemes, it is necessary to establish effective, robust procedures for assessment, monitoring, and implementation of these standards. The development and animal welfare implications of existing Farm Assurance schemes have been reviewed by the UK Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC, 1993) . Existing assurance schemes for dairy farms that give major emphasis to welfare include national dairy farm assurance schemes, the -Freedom Food\u2016 scheme operated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) and Organic Standards. Codes outline the essentials of good husbandry, i.e. stockmanship, health care, accommodation, provision of food and water, and management specific to the needs of different classes and ages of animal. The elements of stockmanship are set out in detail, including the creation of a written health and welfare plan, acquisition of handling and husbandry skills (e.g. castration, tooth clipping), and the ability to recognise early signs of ill health. Protocols are based on audit of the provision of resources to the animals and records of management procedures, such as the provision of health care. None of the current Quality Assurance (QA) schemes for farm animals incorporates a significant element of animal-based welfare assessment. The view widely shared among the scientific community that these observations and records of the provisions necessary to establish good husbandry, should be augmented, and in many cases replaced by animal-based measures, that provide a more direct assessment of animal welfare (Calamari et al. 2004 , Waiblinger et al 2001a . The European Commission, through FP6, has funded a major integrated programme -Integration of animal welfare in the food quality chain: from public concern to improved welfare and transparent quality\u2016 (acronym Welfare Quality \u00ae , Botreau et al. 2007 ). Two of the main subprojects in this programme are directly concerned with the development and implementation of animal-based procedures for monitoring and control of on-farm welfare, namely: -To develop robust on-farm welfare monitoring and information systems for selected farm animal species; -To implement welfare monitoring and information system and the welfare improvement strategies developed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 847, "end": 859, "text": "(FAWC, 1993)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2143, "text": "(Calamari et al. 2004", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2168, "text": ", Waiblinger et al 2001a", "ref_id": "BIBREF1199"}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2420, "text": "Botreau et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Aim"}, {"text": "There are many problems with outcome based measures as they require a level of technical skill that many auditors may not have. Also behavioural measures of welfare require observations of animals over long periods of time, which is often not possible during a brief inspection. The result is that behavioural measures may be either dropped or measured on an inadequate time sample. The time frame of a farm visit also leads to the use of prevalence measures (which are not good for mortality or infrequent, short lasting illness) or reliance on farmers records (which may be faulty) to obtain an estimate of incidence. Good outcome measures are available for some welfare hazards (i.e. measures of lameness may show problems with stall design, flooring or periparturient management) but there are not good practical outcome measures for other welfare hazards (i.e. the pain of dehorning without pain control).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Aim"}, {"text": "Currently the protocols monitoring welfare within QA schemes are based almost entirely on measures of husbandry (resources and records).

It recognises that no farmer can achieve ideal welfare in all the animals all the time and concentrates on what the farmer does, or could do to promote welfare in his animals. However the effectiveness of these approaches can only be established on the basis of reliable methods to assess animal welfare state. Animal-based audits on animal welfare in dairy herds (Whay et al. 2003b ) are presented in more detail in the following section (16.1.3). These animal-based audits revealed no significant overall differences in cow welfare between dairy farms operating to the allegedly higher welfare standards of Freedom Food (Main et al., 2003) and the Soil Association and those registered within the more universal standards laid down by the Assured Dairy Farms scheme. This fact can be interpreted in two ways. Either the welfare standards do not lead to an overall improvement of welfare or the outcome based measures do not measure the full range of welfare problems that were addressed by the standards.

The outcome based measures may shift the attention to the most easily measured welfare problems, which may not be the most serious one. This inevitably requires a degree of compromise between the scientific need to achieve the closest approximation to the truth and the practicalities of making observations on farm without causing undue disturbance to the animals and the operation.

The Producer cycle starts with a structured self-assessment carried out by the farmer that is largely based on elements of husbandry (resources and management). This self-assessment is followed by an independent animal-base monitoring procedure, as described in section 16.1.3. The monitor will provide an overall assessment of on-farm welfare and (possibly) identify specific areas where improvements are desirable or necessary to ensure compliance with the QA scheme. This creates a prioritised plan of action for the farmer, possibly in association with his veterinarian. After an appropriate interval (e.g. one year), there is a further review of welfare in general and the effectiveness of specific prioritised actions. This should, once again be based first on selfassessment, then independent monitoring. The aim is to create a dynamic cycle of continuous improvement. The merits of this approach are many. Initial self-assessment by the farmer saves time, and can reflect the fact the farmer knows most (if not best) about his farm. While the first independent assessment may be comprehensive, subsequent assessments can concentrate on the most important issues. Moreover in this system, failure to meet compliance with the standards of the QA scheme would normally not be based on the results of any one assessment but on failure to take effective action where problems had been identified.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 30, "end": 44, "text": "Webster (2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1228"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 107, "text": "Figure 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Implementation of welfare assessment protocols and improvement procedures"}, {"text": "The other wheel of the -virtuous bicycle\u2016 is designed to improve the communication of steps taken to improve animal welfare into the public domain, though information transfer to the public and retailers who claim high standards of animal welfare as part their claim to added value. The procedure would again be dynamic, first assurance based on evidence of attention to improved welfare standards, then promotion, then review to assess impact and possible steps towards further improvement. These issues have also been addressed by Botreau et al (2007) (Fig 14) . The 12 preference dimensions given value judgments are to be derived from ca. 30 specific, proven robust measures of physical and mental state. Information at this level of integration will be used as the basis for focused plans of action designed to address specific welfare problems. For the purpose of communicating information to consumers, it is proposed that farms will be ranked on a four-point scale: unclassified, basal, good and excellent. For most purposes, this would define the welfare status of the farm, or the system; in this case the dairy unit. Retailers and concerned consumers seeking a greater understanding of the basis for this overall ranking would have access to rankings given for the four independent dimensions of welfare, good feeding, good housing, good health and appropriate behaviour. This approach shows great promise, but unresolved issues remain, e.g. the appeal (or lack of appeal) to farmers, retailers and consumers of a ranking system defined as -unclassified, basal, good and excellent\u2016 and the criteria necessary to benchmark farms within these four categories.
