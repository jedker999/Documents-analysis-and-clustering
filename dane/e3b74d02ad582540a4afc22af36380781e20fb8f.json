            "text": "Background/Case Studies: 19 different monoclonal anti-D reagents have been tested in humans, but have not shown equivalent efficacy as donor derived polyclonal anti-D. In addition, some monoclonal anti-D results in a paradoxical enhancement of alloimmunization, an effect also seen with donor derived anti-D in some cases. K1 transgenic mice express the human K1 RBC alloantigen selectively on RBCs. Wild-type mice become alloimmunized to K1 RBCs, when exposed through either transfusion or pregnancy, the latter leading to HDFN. Analogous to anti-D in humans, polyclonal mouse serum derived anti-K1 prevents alloimmunization. Thus, the K1 mouse serves as a model of antibody mediated immune regulation of alloimmunization. Study Design/Methods: IgG subtype was isolated as an independent variable by engineering a panel of IgG subtype switch variants for a monoclonal anti-K1. Monoclonal anti-K1 was isolated for each murine IgG subtype (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3) and each with the same antigenbinding domain. The effects of IgG subtype on clearance and alloimmunization to transfused K1 RBCs was tested. The role of FcgRIIb (the inhibitory FcgR in mice and humans) was tested using FcgRIIb KO mice. The role of activating FcgRs (aFcgR) was tested using a novel conditional knockout mouse (Con-FcgR) where the common gamma chain (required for expression of all murine aFcgRs) is deleted upon exposure to CRE recombinase. Results/Findings: Significant clearance of K11 RBCs was observed with IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2c, but not IgG2b or IgG3. IgG1 and IgG3 significantly decrease, whereas IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c increased anti-K1 alloimmunization. IgG1 and IgG2c were further studied, as examples of suppressing and enhancing antibodies. In FcgRIIb KO mice, clearance was unaffected, suppression by IgG1 was eliminated, and enhancement by IgG2a was not altered. When aFcgRs were deleted in all tissues, no clearance was observed with either subtype, enhancement by IgG2c was eliminated, and suppression by IgG1 was unaffected. Tissue specific deletion of aFcgRs demonstrated that aFcgR expression on dendritic cells (DCs) [and not macrophages] was required for enhancement by IgG2c. Conclusion: Similar to what is observed in humans, some monoclonal anti-RBC antibodies prevented alloimmunization whereas others enhanced. IgG subtype determined inhibition vs. enhancement. Inhibition by IgG1 functions through an FcgRIIb dependent mechanism. Also, lack of clearance but maintenance of suppression by IgG1 in mice lacking aFcgRs indicates clearance is not required for suppression, a finding consistent with data from other murine and some human studies. Enhancement by IgG2a requires expression of aFcgRs by DCs. Follow up studies will be required to see if these findings translate into humans.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) remains the most common cause of death from blood transfusion therapy. A mouse model of TRALI relies on the administration of a MHC Class I (MHC I) monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mice with cognate MHC I antigen; however, the critical site(s) of cognate antigen expression have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that endothelial expression of MHC I is necessary for the development of TRALI. Study Design/Method: Conditional MHC I knockout mice on the C57Bl/6 background were generated by crossing floxed beta2 microglobulin mice (B2mFlox) to a congenic H-2K d expressing C57Bl/6 mouse (C-H2 d ) and to cell-specific Cre strains to delete MHC I in myeloid cells (LysM-Cre), endothelial cells (VECadherin-CreERT2) and platelets (PF4-Cre). TRALI was modeled by the injection of a MHC I mAb (H-2K d ; 34-1-2S) into LPS-primed mice (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). Lung injury was measured using extravascular lung water and lung vascular permeability to 125 I-labelled albumin. To measure the endothelial expression of MHC I within the lung, the left lung was removed for MHC I quantification using flow cytometry. One week after pneumonectomy, these mice were challenged with the TRALI model. Results/Finding: C-H2 d mice are susceptible to TRALI with no significance difference in excess lung water (109 vs. 87 ml, p5NS) and lung vascular permeability (135 vs. 102 ml, p5NS) compared to BALB/c wild-type controls. C-H2 d x B2mFlox x PF4-Cre mice that lack MHC I expression on platelets are fully susceptible to TRALI and show no significant difference in excess lung water (88 vs. 81 ml, p5NS), lung vascular permeability (114 vs. 101 ml, p5NS), lung neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation (2.9 vs. 2.6%, p5NS) or survival at 2 hours (71 vs. 58%, p5NS by log-rank test) compared to C-H2 d x B2mFlox controls. C-H2 d x B2mFlox x VECadherinCreERT2 mice have reduced MHC I expression on lung endothelial cells after neonatal tamoxifen administration (MFI reduction 43 1/-17%, p50.04 vs. C-H2 d x B2mFlox control). With TRALI challenge, Tamoxifen-treated C-H2 d x B2mFlox x VECadherinCreERT2 mice with low-to-intermediate expression of MHC I have a significant reduction in excess lung water (49 vs. 89 ml, p50.01) and lung vascular permeability (31 vs. 63 ml, p50.04) compared to controls with high levels of MHC I expression. C-H2 d x B2mFlox x LysMCremice lack MHC I expression on neutrophils and experiments on susceptibility to TRALI are ongoing. Conclusion: TRALI results from cognate antibody recognition of endothelial MHC I. The vast endothelial surface area of the lung and the first-pass of transfused blood products through the lung may explain the pulmonaryrestricted organ injury after transfused cognate antibody.",

RNA persistence has been reported in whole blood (WB) long after clearance of viremia in plasma, raising concerns over the risk of TT with plasma based nucleic-acid amplification testing (NAT). The dynamics of ZIKV persistence in asymptomatic infection are not well understood and are needed for understanding of the natural history of ZIKV infection. We sought to characterize the dynamics of infection through prospective enrollment of ZIKV RNA1 blood donors. Study Design/Method: Donors identified through investigational ZIKV NAT screening were enrolled into longitudinal follow up and assessed for viral and serological persistence and clinical outcomes. Plasma and RBC were obtained from index donations and blood, urine, saliva and semen samples were collected prospectively at weeks 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 following index donations from 50 donors and detailed symptom questionnaires were administered at each study visit. Blood compartments and body fluids were tested for Zika RNA by real time RT-PCR. Plasma samples were tested for Zika specific IgM and IgG antibodies Results/Finding: The percent of ZIKV RNA1 samples, followed by the number of samples tested in parenthesis, for each sample type during each sampling interval is summarized in the table. Plasma viremia declined rapidly after index donations whereas RBC-and WB-associated viral RNA persisted for up to 3 months and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) associated virus was detected intermittently at low levels and waning by 3 months. Urine and saliva detection decreased significantly after 2 weeks and was undetectable by 3 months. Of donors who were enrolled in the acute pre-seroconversion stage of infection 65% (15/23) developed multiple ZIKV related symptoms 1 week post index donation, compared to only 30% (7/27) for donors detected post-seroconversion.",

The logistics of donor management might differ across blood centers, but the optimal approach may also vary according to biological or behavioral differences across sub-populations of donors. Studies donors have been conducted in predominantly Caucasian populations, which may differ from racial/ethnic minority donors in iron metabolism and capacity to undergo repeat phlebotomy. Study Design/Method: Over 12,600 donors were enrolled from 4 US blood centers for ferritin testing. The study population was enriched for racial minorities [1600 African-American (AA), 1600 Asian (As), 1000 Hispanic (Hisp)] and for \"Super Donors\" (1600, who had completed 101 donations in two years without low hemoglobin deferral). The minority donors and the remaining 6800 non-Hispanic White (NHW) donors were an unselected population with no specific eligibility criteria. Subjects completed questionnaires on risk factors for iron depletion. Logistic regression was used to identify demographic and behavioral predictors of Absent Iron Stores (AIS, ferritin <12 ng/ml) and Low Ferritin (LF, ferritin <26 ng/ml). Results/Findings: Across all subjects, 19% had AIS and 42% had LF, with a high degree of variability based on demographic factors and donation behavior. In models stratified by race, expected patterns common to all 4 groups included a sharp increase in risk with increasing donation intensity, and a large decrement in risk for females > 50 years old. In models including all subjects, race was an independent predictor of both AIS and LF controlling for age, sex, body weight, donation frequency, and other factors (Table) . AA and As donors showed %20% decreased risk for AIS compared to NHW, while Hisp donors had 25% higher risk. Daily use of exogenous iron reduced risk for LF and AIS by 30 to 40%, respectively, while the estimated benefit from less-than-daily use was lower (5 to 19% protection). Regular use of antacids was associated with a 20% or greater increment to risk. Reported use of hormone supplements showed opposing effects in males and females. Use of oral contraceptives or estrogen in females reduced risk by %15-20%, while males who reported current use of supplemental testosterone had twice the estimated risk for AIS.",

            "text": "Conclusion: This large study confirms the high prevalence of LF and AIS in US donors and the principal risk factors of age, sex, and donation frequency. The diverse population studied and the questionnaire data from donors identify additional demographic and behavioral risk factors of secondary importance. In developing iron mitigation strategies, practices based on age and gender could be further refined depending on a given blood center's operational context and donor population. Data are reported as mean (6SD) *P < 0.05 compared to Batf31/1, 200uL HOD RBCs MFI, median fluorescence intensity Background/Case Studies: During storage, red blood cells (RBCs) undergo multiple morphological, biochemical and molecular modifications, collectively called the storage lesion. The proportion of cleared RBCs is correlated with storage duration, which may be responsible for the rapid clearance of up to 25% of transfused RBCs, reducing transfusion yield. It has been shown, using imaging flow cytometry that a subpopulation of morphologically altered RBCs accumulates during storage. The reduced surface area of these small RBCs (sRBCs) suggests their rapid elimination by the spleen in the hours following transfusion. This hypothesis remains to be clarified, since the physiological mechanisms of RBC clearance remain to be precisely identified. Study Design/Method: Murine \"young\" and \"old\" RBCs (respectively on D1 and D14 of storage) were transfused into different models including splenectomized or macrophage-depleted mice. Flow cytometry was used to determine the kinetics of clearance, the transfusion yield and to quantify RBCs retention in organs. The accumulation, during storage, and the posttransfusion disappearance of sRBCs were analyzed by imaging flow cytometry. Results/Finding: Using a murine model of transfusion, we confirmed that the post-transfusion yield decreases with storage duration (62% on D14 vs 100% on D1 of storage). A clearance of the storage-damaged RBCs mediated by spleen and macrophages is shown by significant improvements in post-transfusion yield observed in the splenectomized (74%) and macrophage-depleted (79%) groups. As in humans, we observed the accumulation of a subpopulation of small RBCs (mouse small RBC: msRBC) of reduced projected surface area with altered morphology. These msRBCs disappear rapidly from the circulation in control or splenectomized mice with a decrease of more than 50% at 2h post-transfusion. In contrast, in macrophage-depleted mice, msRBCs are kept in circulation at 2h posttransfusion. At 24h, these msRBCs completely disappear in all models, suggesting the importance of their elimination and the presence of compensation clearance mechanisms.",

In macrophage-depleted mice, retention is decreased in the spleen and BM. Conversely, elevated retention is observed in the BM of splenectomized mice, associated with a transient retention in the kidney and liver. Conclusion: During storage of murine RBCs, damaged RBCs accumulate, and are eliminated following transfusion via spleen/macrophage-mediated mechanisms. They include, as observed in humans, a subpopulation of small RBCs which undergoes a rapid macrophage-mediated clearance. The increase in transfusion yield in the absence of spleen or macrophages suggests that the recipient's functional state is one of its determining factors.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Breakdown of tolerance to RBC antigens may result in development of pathogenic autoantibodies (autoAb) and lead to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a severe and sometimes fatal disease. AIHA in humans has a number of known features, including increased frequency with age, and tendency to relapse and remit. However, the mechanisms behind such observations are not understood. To gain insight into tolerance (or loss thereof) to an RBC autoantigen, we utilized the HOD mouse, which expresses an RBC-specific triple fusion protein consisting of hen egg lysosyme (HEL), ovalbumin (OVA), and, Duffy (HOD). HOD mice were bred to a transgenic mouse that expresses a T cell receptor specific for an OVA peptide in HOD presented by MHCII (OTII mice). Thus, HOD 1 OTII 1 mice are predisposed to have autoreactive CD4 1 T cells. Study Design/Method: Four cohorts of HODxOTII F1 mice (16-48 mice/ cohort) were bled monthly for 15 months to assess for autoAb production. Peripheral RBCs were stained with anti-complement (C3) and mouse immunoglobulin Ab. Spleens were weighed and splenocytes were stained with anti-CD71 and TER119 to assess for the presence of RBC progenitors. Statistical analysis between HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAb 1 vs. HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAbvs. HOD -OTII 1 was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and corrected for multiple testing with Dunn's test. Results/Finding: OTII CD4 1 T cells were not deleted in the thymus of HOD 1 OTII 1 mice; rather, they matured to the periphery. Despite these peripheral autoreactive T cells, no detectable autoAb were observed in HOD 1 OTII 1 . However, as they aged, 15-50% of HOD 1 OTII 1 were positive for RBC autoAb by 6 months. Thereafter, $50% of the autoAb 1 mice stopped producing autoAb within two months after onset and remained autoAb free throughout the study. In 3 of the 4 cohorts, 60-100% of autoAb 1 mice were female. HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAb 1 mice also had enlarged spleens compared to HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAband HOD -OTII 1 mice (0.42g vs. 0.21g and 0.14g, resp., p<0.04). This may due to RBC consumption, extramedullary erythropoiesis, or both. Consistent with increased erythropoiesis, elevated numbers of RBC progenitors (CD71 hi Ter119 inter ) were observed in the spleens of HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAb 1 mice but not in HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAband HOD -OTII 1 (2.86% vs. 0.06% and 0.05% resp., p<0.03). Moreover, autoAb and C3 deposition were found (0.1-2% and 3-10%, resp.) on Ter119 1 RBCs in all of the HOD 1 OTII 1 autoAb 1 mice analyzed. Conclusion: Several features known to exist in human AIHA were observed, including age-dependant autoAb production, relapsing of autoimmunity after onset, and an increased frequency in females. This model may serve as an experimental system to investigate the mechanisms of AIHA.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization occurs in up to 10% of transfusion recipients (excluding ABO and RhD). The underlying factors that influence alloimmunization are poorly understood; thus, there is currently no reliable way to predict who will make an alloantibody and who will not. Patients who receive multiple RBC units or several separate transfusions are at higher risk of alloimmunization; likewise, certain disease states have higher rates of alloimmunization, such as myelodysplasctic syndrome (MDS) and sickle cell disease patients. However, despite chronic transfusions, some patients never develop RBC alloantibodies. It has been recently reported that poly (I:C)-elicited inflammation leads to enhanced alloimmunization rates and is correlated with increased splenic neutrophil (PMN) numbers. Additionally, RBC transfusion into an inflamed recipient leads to enhanced erythrophagocytosis by PMNs. Here, we test the hypothesis that PMNs regulate RBC alloantibody generation. Study Design/Method: Mice: C57Bl/6 (B6) mice were treated with PBS, or anti-Ly6G to deplete PMNs, followed by poly (I:C) to elicit inflammation, and finally a transfusion of allogeneic DiO-labeled RBCs expressing a synthetic antigen, HOD (HEL-OVA-Duffy). Multiple splenic cellular subsets were evaluated for DiO fluorescence, an indirect measure of RBC consumption, at 18-24 hours post-transfusion. Anti-HOD alloantibody generation was assessed 14 days post-transfusion by flow cytometry. Humans:Retrospectively, mean white blood cell (WBC) and PMN counts were collected on chronically transfused MDS patients at VA Connecticut Healthcare. For alloimmunized patients (n55), WBC and PMN counts were assessed on the day of exposure to the alloimmunizing RBC unit, whereas counts were averaged for the entirety of RBC therapy for non-alloimmunized patients (n55). Patients were matched for numbers of RBC transfusions. Results/Finding: Mice: The MFI of anti-HOD antibodies was significantly increased in PMN-depleted mice, compared to controls (3/3 experiments, p<0.01). While many control mice made no alloantibody (non-responders), all PMN-depleted mice made detectable anti-HOD. PMN depletion also led to a significant reduction in DiO1 leukocytes, suggesting a lack of compensatory mechanism(s) for RBC consumption. Absence of PMNs also shifted RBC consumption from macrophages to immune-stimulating dendritic cell subsets. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that PMNs with internalized RBCs upregulated expression of co-inhibitory molecules (e.g. PD-L1), compared to PMNs (without internalized RBCs) from the same mouse; thus, PMNs may regulate alloimmunization through antigen presentation and/or inhibitory signals. Humans:. Alloimmunized MDS patients had a significant decrease in PMNs, compared to non-alloimmunized (p<0.05); no significant differences were detected in mean WBC counts between the two arms. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that in both murine and human settings, PMNs may play a significant role in regulating RBC alloimmunization and may provide key insights into predicting which patients will become alloimmunized.

In contrast, in whole blood of non-responder patients, there is an unexpected expression of circulating CD4 1 T cells with a CXCR5 1 PD1 1 phenotype. This phenotype is usually associated with the presence of Tfh cells, specialized in the production of antibodies. It has been suggested that some of the activated circulating Tfh could have a CXCR5 1 PD1 hi profile, with a differentiated expression of CCR7. CCR7 is essential for T cells domiciliation in lymph nodes where the encounter T and B cells is major for B cell differentiation and antibody production.

All assays were performed on whole blood without separation procedures that are known to alter the expression of chemokine receptors Results/Finding: The CXCR5 1 PD1 hi subpopulation expression was identical between transfused groups and controls. CCR6 and CXCR3 expressions show no difference between the transfused groups or the controls. However, in non-responder patients, CCR7 expression was very strong independently of the expression of PD1. In the aim to determine the help of the circulating CXCR5 1 PD1 1 cells in the production of antibodies, these cells were purified by flow cytometry and co-cultured for 5 days with B cells, and in the presence of SEB protein. The levels of antibodies after SEB stimulation were identical with the CXCR5 1 PD1 1 subpopulations from transfused groups or controls. Conclusion: The paradoxical presence of circulating CXCR5 1 PD1 1 cells in non-responder transfused patients do not appear to have any particular functions that can promote the absence of a humoral response. However, in responder patients, the high expression of CCR7 on circulating CXCR5 1 PD1 1 cells suggests remarkable migratory properties towards secondary lymphoid organs, and could facilitate allo-immune responses.

However, individuals that do generate alloantibodies appear to experience an increased rate of additional alloantibody formation following subsequent transfusion. However, how immunity to one RBC alloantigen primes immunization to a completely distinct alloantigen remains unknown. Though CD4 T cell help classically occurs through direct recognition of a peptide that resides within a target B cell antigen, individuals who develop antibodies toward one RBC alloantigen experience increased rates of antibody formation against completely distinct RBC alloantigens. These observations suggest that CD4 T cells that respond to one alloantigen may directly facilitate immunity to a completely distinct RBC alloantigen. Study Design/Method: B6 recipients were transfused with KEL RBCs in the presence or absence of poly I:C (PIC), followed by transfusion of HOD RBCs, KEL RBCs, RBCs expressing HOD and KEL (HOD x KEL), or a mixture of HOD and KEL RBCs (HOD 1 KEL). To examine the role of CD4 T cells, PIC/KEL primed B6 recipients were CD4 T cell depleted prior to transfusion. In addition, B6 recipients were adoptively transferred with CD4 T cells from na\u20ac \u0131ve or PIC/KEL primed donors, followed by transfusion of HOD RBCs or (HOD x KEL) RBCs. Anti-HOD and anti-KEL alloantibody formation was evaluated using indirect immunofluorescence staining. Results/Findings: KEL RBC transfusion in the presence of PIC (PIC/KEL) not only enhanced anti-KEL antibody production through a CD4 T celldependent process, but this same priming event directly facilitated anti-HOD antibody formation following subsequent (HOD x KEL) RBC transfusion (p < 0.001); PIC/KEL primed recipients transfused with (HOD 1 KEL) RBCs or HOD RBCs alone failed to impact anti-HOD antibody formation. The ability of immunity to KEL to boost a humoral response to the HOD antigen following (HOD x KEL) RBC transfusion required KEL priming in the presence of PIC. CD4 T cell depletion prevented PIC/KEL primed recipients from boosting an anti-HOD antibody response (p < 0.0001) and transfer of CD4 T cells from PIC/KEL primed recipients likewise directly facilitated anti-HOD antibody formation following a (HOD x KEL) RBC transfusion (p < 0.001).",

Immune-mediated platelet clearance by anti-platelet alloantibodies plays a significant role, and patients with detectable alloantibodies can be managed with transfusion of HLA-matched platelets. Still, many patients are refractory even after receiving HLA-matched platelets. It was shown previously that CD8 T cells can play a direct role in platelet clearance, as allogeneic platelets are cleared within 24 hours post transfusion in B celldeficient mMT recipient mice (ie in the absence of anti-platelet alloantibodies) and depletion of CD8 T cells prevents such clearance. Since minor antigenic differences still exist between donor HLA-matched platelets and a recipient, we hypothesized that minor antigens alone may mediate clearance of otherwise HLA-matched platelets. Study Design/Method: To test whether minor antigens can stimulate CD8 T cell-dependent platelet clearance we examined platelet refractoriness using mOva and OTI transgenic mice. Leukoreduced donor platelets from mOva mice, which express a membrane-bound form of chicken ovalbumin and thus present ovalbumin peptides complexed with murine MHC class I H2Kb, were labelled in vivowith the fluorescent dye CFSE and transfused into wildtype (WT, C57BL/6) mice or OTI mice, whose CD8 T cell receptors recognize a specific ovalbumin peptide in the context of MHC class I H2Kb.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Alloimmunization against major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens is a common complication of transfusion, and can negatively impact subsequent transfusions and transplants. We have previously demonstrated that pathogen reduction with riboflavin and UV light (UV1R) is effective both at rapidly killing donor white blood cells (WBCs) and at blocking their ability to stimulate an allogeneic response in vitro. Furthermore, UV1R treatment of allogeneic platelet rich plasma (PRP) prevents alloimmunization in mice, and provides partial antigen-specific tolerance to subsequent transfusions. As cells that die through different pathways can be either tolerizing or inflammatory, we sought to determine which cell death pathways are triggered by UV1R, as well as evaluate the immunogenicity of PRP containing WBCs killed by other methods. Study Design/Method: WBC-rich PRP was prepared from C57Bl/6 mouse blood and treated with UV1R, and WBCs prepared in parallel from the same blood were treated with known inducers of either apoptosis or necrosis. Membrane integrity, phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase activity, and chromatin condensation were evaluated by flow cytometry. BALB/c recipients were transfused with either UV1R treated WBC-rich PRP, or UV1R treated WBC-poor PRP either alone or with added untreated, apoptotic, or necrotic WBCs, all generated from allogeneic C57Bl/6 donor blood. A second transfusion of untreated WBC-rich C57Bl/6 PRP was given 2 weeks later, and alloresponses were compared against mice given no transfusion or only the second untreated transfusion. Results/Finding: UV1R treated WBCs have a pattern of phosphatidylserine exposure and loss of membrane integrity consistent with early apoptosis, but fail to demonstrate significant caspase activity or clear chromatin condensation. Alloantibody responses to transfusion were significantly higher in mice previously exposed to untreated (p<0.01) or necrotic (p<0.05) WBCs, but not those given UV1R treated or apoptotic WBCs. Ex vivo cytokine responses to stimulation with C57Bl/6 WBCs were reduced in recipients of either UV1R or apoptotic WBCs, and enhanced in recipients of untreated or necrotic WBCs. Conclusion: The mechanism of WBC death following UV1R treatment shares some membrane characteristics of early apoptosis, but is distinct from classic apoptosis. However, both UV1R treated and apoptotic WBCs fail to trigger an alloresponse, and offer some protection against subsequent alloexposures. Background/Case Studies: In mitochondria-less red blood cells (RBCs), oxygen is the main substrate for oxidative reactions and resulting oxidative damage is considered as one of the major causative factors in the development of RBC storage lesion. Oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) of venous blood is generally assumed to be around 70-80% as measured from a central venous line. However, a recent investigation of SO 2 levels in freshly prepared leukocyte-reduced red cell concentrates (LR-RCCs) revealed unexpectedly wide SO 2 distribution (mean 45.9%617.5% [Yoshida et al. 2017; Blood Transfusion 15, 172] . The present study was undertaken to determine the distribution of SO 2 in LR-RCC produced at a medium-size blood center using a novel non-invasive SO 2 probe. Additionally, quantitative metabolomics were carried out to examine the redox status of the stored RBC under various SO 2 levels. Study Design/Method: The SO 2 from 977 units of LR-RCC were examined on five consecutive days representing 78% of the collected units during the period at a regional blood center where all the units were processed at room temperature within 8 hours of blood collection. SO 2 was measured noninvasively through the PVC bag immediately prior to refrigeration by employing a Resonance Raman spectrometry (Pendar Microvascular Oximeter A3U11; Pendar Technologies, Cambridge MA). In addition to SO 2 , process methods, RCC volumes, blood types, gender and process times were recorded for analyses. In a separate study, LR-RCC (n54) from human volunteers were stored in AS-3 under normoxic, hyperoxic, or hypoxic conditions for up to 42 days (SO 2 ranging from <3 to >95%) prior to UHPLC-MS metabolomics analyses in presence of 13 C, 15 N or deuterated internal stable-isotope labeled standards for absolute quantitation. Results/Finding: Measurements of SO 2 carried out non-invasively at a blood center yielded a similar wide distribution as previous study from 497 units of LR-RCC procured and sampled invasively within 24 hours after blood collection [Yoshida ibid]. The shape of the SO 2 distribution appeared near normal with the mean of 47.0%621.0%, median 45.2%, range < 5% to > 95% and inter-quartile range (IQR) of 31.4%-61.9%. Male donors showed higher SO 2 compared to female donors (p<0.04). No correlations were observed between SO 2 levels and processing time, donor age or blood types. Metabolomics workflow indicated that lower SO 2 levels ameliorate the energy and oxidative metabolic lesion. Lower SO 2 levels yielded higher rate of GSH synthesis, higher NADPH concentration, higher GSH / GSSG and NADPH/NADP 1 ratios, lower supernatant urate consumption and lower purine oxidation.",

PrP C can be converted post-translationally into scrapie-PrP (PrP Sc ), which is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru in humans, and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals. However, biological functions of PrP C have yet to be conclusively elucidated. Study Design/Method: In this study, PrP C knockout mice (KO) are utilized to investigate the role of PrP C in the hematopoietic system with controls of age and sex-matched PrP C transgenic mice harboring a slightly augmented PrP C expression. Peripheral blood was examined by hematology analyzer to establish counts. Bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry using a comprehensive panel of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for all hematologic cell precursors/ lineages. Histology of bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes were evaluated by light microscopy. Results/Finding: Complete blood count (CBC) showed a significant increase of WBC in KO mice. Closer analysis of WBC differential revealed that the elevated number of WBC in KO mice was due to lymphocytosis. Specifically, KO mice had a 3-fold increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (KO 7.59 6 4.63 x10 9 /L vs. WT 2.90 6 1.32 x10 9 /L, p 5 0.0303), as well as a higher lymphocyte percentage compared to controls. KO mice also had a trend toward higher hemoglobin, RBC, and hematocrit compared to WT mice. Additionally, platelet count in KO mice was higher than control mice. Of interest, the mean platelet volume indicating platelet size was significantly increased in KO mice compared to controls (KO 6.00 6 0.29 fL vs. WT 5.24 6 0.56 fL, p50.0140). A comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of all cell lineages revealed no significant differences in the numbers of RBC and megakaryocyte in BM, and of lymphocytes in the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Histological analysis of BM, thymus, spleen and lymph node tissue from KO and WT animals failed to show morphological differences between the two groups. Conclusion: Absence of PrP C resulted in significant leukocytosis and specifically higher absolute count and percentage of lymphocytes, as well as larger platelets in peripheral blood, but does not appear to affect hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Our findings indicate that PrP C might be critical in the survival and trafficking of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The molecular mechanisms underlying the observed changes in lymphocytes and platelets, and whether these involve functional changes in these cells will be subject of future studies.",

Results/Finding: As compared with direct contact co-culture, separated CD8 1 Treg cells could suppress the proliferation of effector cells with a small decline (p>0.05), which means some non-contact factors involved in the CD8 1 Treg mediated immune modulation. A total number of 4.57 6 0.52 3 10 8 /10 6 cells exosomes were harvest. Electron microscope analysis demonstrated a kind of round-shaped membrane vesicle 50-150nm in diameter (145.16 6.7nm by NTA). CD63 and CD81 were expressed on these Background/Case Studies: Regulatory T cells (Tregs), containing CD4 1 and CD8 1 subtypes, play an essential role in immune regulation and autoimmune disease prevention which makes it a potential candidate for cell therapy on autoimmune disease (AIDs). Unfortunately, due to the instability of natural CD4 1 Foxp3 1 regulatory T cells (nTregs) in inflammation conditions (including instability of Foxp3, conversion to pro-inflammatory effector cells and was unable to modify established disease), thus, it is needed to investigate CD81 regulatory T cells stability both in vitro and in vivo. In our previous works, we found that CD8 1 Treg has an effective therapeutic function on CIA mice. In this study we aim to investigate the stability of induced polyclonal human CD8 1 regulatory T cells in inflammation and transfusion. Study Design/Method: Human CD8 1 Tregs were induced with TGF-b1 and rapamycin from CD8 1 T lymphocytes in vitro. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were induced with type-two collagen as an autoimmune disease model. In vitro the stability of CD8 1 Tregs when encountering with inflammation were test by Foxp3 expression, Th1 and Th17 cells conversion in inflammations conditions (IL21TGF-b11IL211IL23 and IL21TGF-b11IL1b1IL6) on day3, day6 and day9. In vivo, CD8 1 Tregs were transfused into CIA mice and then their survival in mice and Foxp3 express were evaluated to reveal the stability of CD8 1 Tregs in an inflammation condition model. Additionally, we also investigate the stability maintenance of CD8 1 Tregs when induced factor TGF-b1 and rapamycin were removed by testing the Foxp3 expression on day3, day6 and day9. Results/Finding: Ex vivo induced human CD8 1 Treg were Foxp3 1 (90.40 6 1.40%) and did not secret IL17A (both in supernatant and % of cells). Foxp3 express in CD8 1 Tregs were maintained after induced factor TGF-b1 and rapamycin were removed on day3, day6 and day9. In vitro, Foxp3, IL2 and IFN-c expression has no significant difference when compared with controlled Tregs on day3, day6 and day9 and did not secret IL17A when encounter with inflammation conditions (IL21TGF-b11IL211IL23 and IL21TGF-b11IL1b1IL6). In vivo, CD81 Treg cells were transfused into CIA mice on the peak of disease onset (35 days after the first Collagen immunization, has inflammation condition in vivo) to test CD8 1 Tregs survival. CD8 1 Tregs were found in CIA mice foot (27.4 6 2.03%), blood (4.55 6 1.03%) and spleen cells (1.90 6 0.05%) 72 hours after transfusion and their % of foxp3 1 were remained. Conclusion: The results revealed that ex-vivo induced and expanded human CD8 1 Tregs are stable in inflammation and transfusion and can maintain Foxp3 expression when induced factor were removed, these make CD8 1 Treg a novel and stable cell for potential cell therapy on AIDs. This research can provide some instructive reference and improve the utilization of blood components.",

Shanghai Blood Center Background/Case Studies: Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) adoptive cellular immunotherapy is a cutting edge strategy for treating hypersensitivity response disease, in which immune responses are directed against selfantigens, such as atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA),et al. However, the traditional strategy base on the tDCs was usually unstable and inconspicuous through cytokines inducing processing so that might be the limitations on tDC adaptive cell therapy in future clinical use. Study Design/Method: Human tDCs were derived from fresh purified monocytes from PBMNCs isolated from buffy coat and induced by mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and temsirolimus) in safe concentrations confirmed by apoptosis assay when the cells were completely differentiated. The mature markers and endocytisis were detected by flow cytometry. The production of cytokines and chemokines was measured using ELISA. Mechanism investigation was analysis by Real-time PCR and Western blotting. Contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model, an atopic dermatitis animal model, was treated with tDCs induced via mTOR suppression and analyzed by ear thickness and tissue leukocytes number calculating. Results/Finding: Human tDCs treated with mTOR inhibitors had a lower mature marker CD83/CD80/CD86 expression after TLR signaling activation, accompanied with a set of cytokines and chemokines remarkably downregulated in a concentration dependent manner but not the LPS absent group. Moreover, mTOR suppression extremely reduced the capacity of LPS treated human DCs to stimulate autogenic na\u20ac \u0131ve T cell proliferation, which is one of the most important characteristics of tDC. Beyond expectation, the common signal transduction pathway, MAPK and NF-jB pathway, were not the signal target so that it could hardly be the explanation for the tolerogenic performance of tDC when exposure to LPS stimulation. However, the P70S6K and its downstreanm proteins, especially the protein S6, which controls the protein translation, were shown in charge of the tolerogenic induction mechanism. The data were also supporting the suggestion that rare difference on mRNA transcription of the related functional proteins in tDCs induced by mTOR inhibitors when exposure to LPS stimulation from the non-induced cells, although there was more transcription of IDO induced by mTOR inhibitors. More important, edema responses of ears were clearly weakened in the CHS model and recruited less leukocytes to the tissue when co-sensitized with mTOR inhibitors or with tDCs induced by mTOR inhibitors suggested that the tDC induced by mTOR suppression were able to control hypersensitivity inflammation response in vivo. Conclusion: Accordingly, tDC induced by mTOR suppression is a potent adoptive cellular immunotherapy strategy for treating hypersensitivity response disease and the induction mechanism of it might be through suppressing systematically effective function proteins by mTOR-S6 related protein translation inhibition.",

Bioactive lipids generated during RBC storage have been implicated in certain adverse outcomes. Recently, we reported that bioactive lipids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their oxidized products (oxylipins) accumulate during RBC storage despite leukoreduction. To evaluate the extent of membrane lipid degradation and oxidation in stored RBC units among the donor population with different blood groups, we quantified PUFAs and lysophospholipids (LPLs) in 405 leukoreduced RBC units. Study Design/Method: RBC units from different donors were acquired and processed on day 43 (one day past their expiration). 35 bioactive lipids including 10 common Fatty acids, 10 oxylipins, and 15 LPLs were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MS/MS-MRM). Total fatty acid concentrations of selected units were also analyzed. A One-way ANOVA test was used to determine significant difference of analytes amongst the different blood groups. Results/Finding: We observed a wide distribution in concentration of major PUFAs in 405 stored RBC units. For example, arachidonic acid (AA) ranges from 0.5 -10.7 mM, linoleic acid (LA) (1.4-28 mM), dihomo-c-linolenic acid (DGLA) (0.1-0.8 mM), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (0.03-3.1 mM), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (0.2-3.0 mM), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (0.06-2.3 mM). Ten oxylipins including HETEs, HODEs, and DiHOMEs, and 15 LPLs including LPCs, LPSs, and LPEs all showed a large variation in concentration among donors. Of 35 analytes quantified, 25 showed a significant difference in concentration among different blood types by one-way ANOVA testing (FDR<0.05). The AB Rh1 blood group consistently exhibited the lowest concentration of major PUFAs, while the O Rh-blood group showed the highest, averaging a two-fold difference in concentration (O Rh-/AB Rh1). The fold increase of O Rh-/O Rh1 among PUFAs ranges from 1.3 to 2.1, suggesting the Rh blood group, independent of the ABO blood group, correlates with donor to donor variation in lipid metabolism. Conclusion: The wide distribution in the concentration of bioactive lipids among 405 stored RBC units suggests that lipid degradation is highly donor-Background/Case Studies: To ensure availability of biological products to hospitals, blood banks have developed and validated multiple storage conditions for each of their products to maximize shelf life and quality. In the case of labile products, their metabolism is known to remain active during storage, leading to storage lesions. microRNAs (miRNAs) levels are modulated by these storage-related damages, which makes miRNAs ideal candidates as potential biomarkers of quality monitoring. Lately, nanoparticles have been widely studied and used for biosensing applications. The objective of this work is to develop biocompatible gold nanosensors for sensitive, selective and direct detection of biomarkers to characterize and assess the quality of blood products delivered to hospitals. Study Design/Method: Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) surrounded by a fluorescent silica shell were prepared using a wet chemistry method. miRNA-223 was chosen as a potential target, since it is strongly expressed in platelet concentrates and its concentration fluctuates according to storage lesions. Custom RNA and DNA molecular beacons were designed and used as a probe for the specific detection of miRNA-223 targets in PBS and human plasma. These fluorescent transducer probes were conjugated at the surface of fluorescent silica shell-GNPs using an EDC/NHS cross-linking reaction. The hybridization reaction between the target and the probe initiates an energy transfer mechanism which can be recorded by fluorescence. Results/Finding: GNPs (49 6 6 nm) surrounded by a thick fluorescent silica shell (22 6 2 nm) were prepared and used as nanosensors because of their optimal luminescence properties and long-term stability. Conjugation of the probe onto the nanoparticles was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, as well as nanoparticle tracking analysis. The fluorescent response of the molecular beacons was studied and showed a reproducible and linear relationship (R 2 RNAprobe 5 0.96 and R 2 DNAprobe 5 0.98) with miRNA-223 concentration, down to a 10-nM limit of detection. Hybridization assays in 1% human plasma appear to demonstrate denaturation of RNA probes and targets. Conclusion: Biocompatible fluorescent GNPs were prepared and used as tools for blood product characterization. The conjugation of a molecular beacon at the surface of nanoparticles was achieved and characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The functionalization of the probe is still being optimized. The fluorescence response of the molecular beacon was characterized for the detection of a model miRNA target in PBS and in 1% human plasma.",

In vitro studies have demonstrated the effects of pathogen inactivation on storage lesion, but little routine quality control data on blood banking outcomes have been reported. Study Design/Method: Swirling of distributed products was monitored one year before and one year after implementation of Intercept pathogen inactivation. Metabolic parameters like pH, glucose and lactic acid were determined in a random sample of expired pathogen inactivated products. Furthermore, indicators of platelet storage lesion were measured in apheresis concentrates with premature low swirling and compared to controls with normal swirling. Results/Finding: In an experimental phase on a limited number of products (n56) to validate the Intercept pathogen inactivation method, pH and glucose levels decreased faster in apheresis platelet concentrates with high platelet content than with low platelet content or than in pooled buffy coat derived products. Once pathogen inactivation was implemented, routine products showed glucose exhaustion more often when prepared by apheresis compared to buffy coat derived platelet concentrates despite more plasma carryover in the former. Furthermore, the number of apheresis products with premature low swirling increased by 50% (63/12,492) compared to the previous year without pathogen inactivation (42/12, 931, P50.030, Chisquare) . In contrast, the incidence of premature low swirling in platelet concentrates prepared by the buffy coat method decreased (2/15,286 vs 10/ 13,488). Of note, apheresis concentrates with premature low swirling had a significantly higher median platelet count (5.0x10 11 ) than unaffected controls (3.5x10 11 ) and showed signs of increased storage lesion compared to controls expiring on day five without swirling defects. These signs included lower pH, higher lactic acid concentration, increased mean platelet volume, phosphatidylserine exposure and alpha-degranulation.",

Study Design/Methods: 1 Five doses of leuko-reduced RBCs were prepared, and supernatant was isolated by centrifugation on d0, d14 and d35. We looked at the cardiotoxicity of SSRBCs on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).

Thawed cells are better maintained in AS-3 as compared to SAGM. The presence of citrate in AS-3 seems to be necessary to prevent hemolysis of thawed cells. During storage in AS-3, ATP and 2,3-DPG levels rapidly decline. Recently developed additive solutions like PAG3M and AS-7 have shown to better maintain 2,3-DPG and ATP levels during storage of normal, unfrozen, RCC. However, most probably due to the absence of citrate, these solutions are not suitable for storage of thawed cells. We therefore designed PAG3C in which the mannitol of PAG3M was replaced by citrate.",

Study Design/Method: Leukoreduced RCC (n56) in PAG3C (phosphate, adenine, glucose, guanosine, gluconate, citrate) were stored at 2-68C. On day 8, RCCs were glycerolized using ACP215 (Haemonetics V R , Braintree, MA) to a final concentration of 40% (w/v), frozen and stored for at least two weeks at -808C. After thawing and deglycerolization using ACP215, RCC were resuspended in PAG3C. During storage at 2-68C, stability (hemolysis), ATP and 2,3-DPG levels were determined. Results were compared with thawed RCC (prefreeze storage in SAGM, n58) resuspended in or SAGM (n54). Results/Finding: Pre-freeze storage in PAG3C resulted in increased 2,3-DPG levels at day 8 as compared to storage in SAGM, resp. 9.1 6 7.6 mmol/g Hb and 1.9 6 0.7 mmol/g Hb. Hemolysis during post-thaw storage in PAG3C remained below 0.8% for 35 days and was comparable with storage in AS-3. In SAGM, hemolysis remained below 0.8% for 7 days. During the first 2 weeks of post-thaw storage in PAG3C, both ATP and 2,3-DPG levels increased, followed by a gradual decline during prolonged storage. During the whole postthaw storage period, RCCs in PAG3C showed significantly higher ATP and 2,3-DPG levels compared to AS-3 or SAGM. While in SAGM and AS-3, 2,3-DPG levels were undetectable after 7 days post-thaw storage, in PAG3C, 2,3-DPG levels only decreased to 6.1 lmol/g Hb after 35 days of storage. Conclusion: Pre-freeze storage in PAG3C resulted in increased 2,3-DPG levels. As compared to AS-3, post-thaw storage in PAG3C showed comparable hemolysis while ATP and 2,3-DPG levels were much better maintained. Based on a maximum allowed hemolysis of 0.8% and an ATP content of >2.7mmol/g Hb, thawed RCC can be stored at 2-68C for 35 days in PAG3C. Background/Case Studies: Platelets (PLTs) are vital for effective treatment of hemorrhage. Cold (48C, 4C) storage of PLTs in platelet additive solution (PAS) is a promising alternative to conventional storage at room temperature (RT) due to a lower risk of bacterial concerns, preservation of PLT function, and mitigation of PLT activation. Currently only 2 apheresis (AP) and PAS systems are FDA-approved for use in the US: Trima and Isoplate-PAS (ISO; Terumo) and Amicus and Intersol (INT; Fenwal) . The goal of this study was to assess the adhesive function of long-term cold-stored PLTs collected by FDA-approved AP/PAS methods.",

Samples were tested on Day 1 (baseline, BL), 5, 10, and 15 of storage to assess PLT adhesion under shear flow (Bioflux). ACD vacutainer tubes were collected from donors and centrifuged to obtain red blood cells (RBCs) for all Bioflux runs. Simulated whole blood was created by combining PLTs labeled with calcein-AM with RBCs at 40% Hct. Labeled blood was perfused through microfluidic channels (Fluxion) coated with 100 ug/ml type-1 collagen at 720s -1 shear rate. Images were acquired every 30 sec for 10 min using a fluorescent microscope and % surface coverage was reported. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and posthoc Tukey test with significance at P<0.05. Results/Finding: Both RT-INT and RT-ISO PLTs showed significantly decreased adhesion by Day 5 of storage compared to BL (BL: 11.6 6 1.7%, RT: 4.9 6 1.2%; p<0.005). 4C-INT samples showed no difference in adhesion at any timepoint compared to BL-INT but significantly enhanced adhesion compared to both RT-INT and RT-ISO. In contrast, 4C-ISO PLTs showed significant enhancement of surface coverage compared to BL-ISO by Day 5 (P50.03) and compared to 4C-INT by Day 10 (P<0.01). Conclusion: Our work suggests that 4C storage of PLTs collected with a Trima AP system in ISO for up to 15 days offers a significant enhancement in adhesive function compared to PLTs collected with an Amicus system in INT and stored at 4C. These results are surprising since both 4C-INT and 4C-ISO have been shown to express similar levels of CD62P, PAC-1, and phosphatidylserine and may suggest differences in PAS PLT intracellular signaling. As expected, storage at 4C of PLTs collected on either platform demonstrated superior function to RT storage. A PLT product with superior hemostatic function and a shelf-life 3x longer than the current standard-ofcare provides the potential for shipment of products to underserved areas and may bolster PLT availability for trauma care in the US.

            "text": "Histo-Blood Group Antigen Lewis Y Promotes Cell Migration Via Regulation of Microtubule Acetylation Huijun Zhu* and Ping Lu. Shanghai Blood Center Background/Case Studies: Blood group antigens are critical for transfusion practices as antibodies raised against them can cause severe transfusion reaction. Beside this, blood group antigens themselves are composed of sugar chains, proteins, lipids, etc, which may be involved in various biological processes. Lewis Y is a histo-blood group antigen belonging to ABH family. LeY consists of carbohydrate chains which may play important roles in cell recognition, adhesion as well as migration, which are all critical steps in tumor progression and thus attracts wide researches focusing on its relevance in tumor biology. LeY is demonstrated to affect cell mirgration via various mechanisms. However. although changes in cytoskeleton organization is the basis for cell motility, little is known about the association between cytoskeleton and LeY. As microtubule and its construction unit tubulin participate in various steps of cell migration, we aim to explore the role of LeY in microtubule and cell migration using breast cancer cells, which may provide reference to clinical study of other histo-blood group antigens and change the way of thinking in transfusion practice. Study Design/Methods: We first manipulate LeY expression in breast cancer cells by overexpression or siRNA knockdown of fucosyltransferases, and block LeY activity in MDA-MB231 cells using anti-LeY antibody, to verify the effect of LeY on cell migration. Then, we detect acetyl-a-tubulin level change as microtubule acetylation is a sign for stability. To establish the role of LeY in cell migration via microtubule modification, we use HDAC6 specific (Tubacin) and nonspecific (TSA) inhibitors to minimize deacetylation of acetyl-atubulin and test again the effect of FUT1 overexpression on cell motility. Results/Findings: FUT1 overexpression increases both LeY expression and cell migration, while FUT1 knockdown leads to the opposite. LeY activity blockade by anti-LeY antibody also significantly inhibits cell migration. Western Blot and Immunostaining results show a-tubulin acetylation level is negatively related with LeY expression. Tubacin or TSA treatment increases the acetyl-a-tubulin level while inhibits cell migration; in the meantime, the significance of FUT1 overexpression in promoting cell migration is eliminated. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the results above that LeY can promote cell migration via regulation of a-tubulin acetylation, wherein LeY may have interaction with deacetylase HDAC6. As tumor promoter, HDAC6 becomes the target of many anti-cancer drugs. We demonstrated the potential association of LeY and HDAC6 function in this study. Many blood group antigens are also carbohydrate chains, which are not only critical in blood group determination, compatible transfusion and immunological reaction, but may also have an effect in the initiation and development of diseases as tumor, similar to LeY; they can even be components in a network with other important molecules and contribute to the destiny of diseases. Transfusion of blood products is frequently needed by tumor patients. Most attention is focused on the search of compatible blood for reducing transfusion reaction. However, it may lower the chance for the disease to advance to take account Background/Case Studies: Reducing the risk of bacterial contamination in platelet (PLT) products is of great concern since PLT storage occurs at room temperature (RT). Pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) were developed to inactivate pathogens prior to transfusion; however, studies have shown that PRT may damage PLTs over the course of extended storage at RT resulting in a greater loss of function than what is normally concomitant with platelet storage lesion. Storage of PLTs in platelet additive solution (PAS) at 48C helps to preserve PLT function and reduces the risk of contamination. In this study, we established the impact of PRT performed after long-term coldstorage of PLTs in PAS, instead of before storage, on PLT function, mitochondrial respiration, and cell death parameters. Study Design/Method: PLT units were collected in PAS (n53) and stored at 48C for up to 10 days. After this time period, the bag was treated using Mirasol PRT (riboflavin and UV). Samples were obtained and tested on the day of collection (baseline, BL), pre-Mirasol (PRE), post-Mirasol (POST), and 30 minutes post-Mirasol . Aggregometry (ADP, Collagen, TRAP), ROTEM, flow cytometry (CD62P [P-Selectin] , lactadherin [PS] , , and GPIb), high-resolution respirometry (Oroboros), and imaging flow cytometry (Amnis) were used for analysis. Data are reported as means6SEM, and paired student's t-tests were used to determine statistical significance (p<0.05). Results/Finding: On Day 10, P-Selectin levels were significantly higher in PRE than BL (p50.03). Mirasol treatment caused a significant increase in PAC-1 expression compared to PRE (PRE: 10.5 6 3.1%, POST: 28.1 6 4.7%; p50.04), which remained after incubation. A significant drop in both Collagen and TRAP aggregation was observed in POST samples compared to PRE, but ADP aggregation response was preserved. No differences in P-Selectin, GPIb expression, and mitochondrial respiration were observed between PRE and POST samples. POST-30 samples displayed significantly less function, higher activation levels, and lower mitochondrial respiration compared to PRE and POST.",

The mortality noted on study was considered to be related to the surgical model and not a result of test article administration. The results also demonstrated that administration of doses of 10% and 33% of the TCPC produced a significant decrease in blood loss. The LCPs at 10% and 33% TCPC were as effective in mitigating blood loss as 2-day old liquid-stored platelets and trended towards being more effective. No appreciable differences in coagulation parameters were observed between groups. Conclusion: The results of the study demonstrate that administration of LCP up to 33% of the TCPC was safe in a canine CABG model. The data also demonstrate that administration of LCP at doses of 10% and 33% of the TCPC reduced blood loss. These results suggest a starting dose above 3.3% TCPC may be required to achieve an effective dose in future human Phase II trials in cardiac patients.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The use of uncrossmatched cold stored whole blood (WB) is becoming increasingly popular in the initial resuscitation of trauma patients without a current ABO group. WB has advantages over conventional component therapy including greater platelet and factor concentrations, as well as less saline and additive solution compared to an equivalent volume of reconstituted whole blood. This report details the initial use of WB in pediatric trauma patients. Study Design/Method: Pediatric trauma patients !3 years old and !15 kg with evidence of hemorrhagic shock were eligible to receive up to 20 cc/kg of cold stored, leukoreduced group O negative WB during their initial resuscitation. All WB units had a low titer of anti-A and -B (<50) to reduce the likelihood of hemolysis in non-group O recipients. Biochemical markers of hemolysis were measured on the day of WB transfusion and the following two days. Admission thromboelastograms were obtained and repeated as necessary during the resuscitation. After receipt of the maximum quantity of WB, conventional components were utilized. Results/Finding: In approximately 11 months, 15 trauma patients received WB: 7 group O and 8 group A recipients, 53% male, median (IQR) age was 11 (4.5-14) and 73% blunt trauma mechanism. Patients were severelyinjured with a median (IQR) Injury Severity Score of 36 (22-51) and 47% mortality rate. The median (IQR) quantity of WB transfused to group O recipients was 21.9 (14.8-24.3) ml/kg versus 13.4 (9-18) ml/kg to non-group O recipients. No transfusion reactions were reported. The mean 6 standard deviation haptoglobin concentrations for non-group O recipients was 51.3 6 14.4 mg/dl on day 0, 86.3 6 36.8 mg/dl on day 1, and 126.9 6 45.8 mg/dl on day 2; the corresponding haptoglobin concentrations for group O recipients were 51.4 6 38.0 mg/dl, 84.7 6 61.5 mg/dl, and 134.8 6 68.3 mg/dl, respectively (p>0.42 for all comparisons). Similarly there were no significant differences in total bilirubin, LDH, creatinine, and potassium at any time point. Regarding evaluation of cold platelet function, we compared the subset of patients who received WB but no warm platelets (n57) to a historical group of pediatric trauma patients who received conventional components including warm platelets (n514). The mean 6 standard deviation platelet volume administered was 112 6 24 cc for whole blood recipients versus 147 6 68 cc for warm platelet recipients. When pre-and posttransfusion TEG and platelet counts were analyzed, there was no difference in median platelet count or TEG maximum amplitude (MA) between cold and warm platelet groups. Conclusion: Use of cold-stored uncrossmatched whole blood for the resuscitation of pediatric trauma patients is feasible, acceptable, and appears to be safe. Receipt of low titer group O WB did not lead to detectable hemolysis amongst the non-group O recipients. Given this finding, the maximum quantity of WB per patients will be increased to 30 ml/kg.",

Background/Case Studies: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is lifesaving for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but is commonly complicated by RBC alloimmunization. Despite transfusion protocols serologically matching for C,E, and Kell antigens, alloimmunization to Rh antigens continues. SCD patients often exhibit a hybrid RHD-CE-D gene which is often characterized by the production of a partial C antigen. It has been previously documented that 30% of C1 SCD patients from the West Indies and West and Central Africa are partial C and at (30%) risk for alloimmunization to the C antigen through transfusion of C1 RBCs. This study sought to determine the prevalence within a cohort of children with SCD at a U.S comprehensive SCD center. Study Design/Method: RBC genotyping results performed on all SCD patients using PreciseType HEA array (Immucor, Norcross, GA) at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta were reviewed and compared to the serologic type for Rh (C/c, E/e) antigens. The prevalence of C-antigen positive patients (serologically) was determined overall, and compared to the prevalence partial C antigen based on the detection of the RHCE*ce(733G,1006T) allele in the absence of an RHCE gene encoding a conventional C antigen in trans, since this allele is commonly linked to the hybrid RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D gene which encodes the partial C antigen.",

Acute ZIKV infection is mainly asymptomatic or presents as a self-limited disease but also includes severe congenital defects and neurologic disorders. The large proportion of asymptomatic cases, high numbers of returning travelers from ZIKV-active areas, severe clinical consequences to developing fetuses, the detection of RNA in asymptomatic donors during the French Polynesia epidemic, and 4 suspected cases of transfusion transmission in Brazil led FDA to release guidance documents to minimize the risk of ZIKV transmission via blood/ blood components. Study Design/Method: Investigational testing by mini-pool (MP)-NAT using the Procleix Zika Virus Assay (TMA) was implemented on collections from five presumed high-risk US states on 6/20/16 (FL, GA, SC, MS, AL). Following revised guidance on 8/26/16, testing was extended to all blood donations; conversion from MP-NAT to individual donation (ID)-NAT was implemented in phases and completed on 12/12/16.

No reactive donations were identified by MP-NAT. Of the 1,895,142 ID-NAT donations, 72 were initial reactive (IR) of which 8 (11%) confirmed positive (CP) by subsequent testing (CP rate of 1:286,107; positive predictive value of 11%; specificity of 99.997%). Five (62%) CP donations were ID-NAT repeat reactive (RR); 3 (38%) donations were ID-NAT IR only, IgM positive and RNA positive in RBCs. CP donors resided in MA, TX, CA, NY, WV and 3 in FL, 2 of which were local transmissions. Six donors had traveled to a ZIKV-active area returning to the US from 2 to 73 days prior to donation. Two donors with a travel risk reported clinical symptoms; 6 CP donors (75%) remained asymptomatic. ZIKV RNA was detected in RBCs from all CP index donations with estimated levels varying from less than 40 copies (c)/mL to about 8\u00ca 5 c/mL.

The cobasV R Zika test was approved under an investigational new drug application on March 30, 2016 and testing of Puerto Rico donations began on April 3, 2016. As a precautionary measure some blood centers in the US states also began NAT testing for ZIKV. In August 2016, the FDA recommended universal screening of all blood donations. The aim of this study is to describe the detection of ZIKV RNA in blood donations collected in US states between April 3, 2016 -February 28, 2017 using the investigational cobasV R Zika for use on the cobas V R 6800/8800 Systems. Study Design/Methods: Donations were screened with cobasV R Zika by individual donation testing. All initial reactive (IR) results were repeated in duplicate. Supplemental testing included an alternative NAT (AltNAT) assay which is less sensitive than cobasV R Zika and serology testing for anti-Zika IgM and IgG. Reactive donors were invited to enroll in follow-up, which included cobasV R Zika and serology testing. A donor was considered to be Zika confirmed positive if at least one replicate of the repeat testing by cobasV R Zika was reactive on index donation or follow-up, reactive by AltNAT on the index donation, or positive for anti-Zika IgM on index or follow-up. All IR donations were also retested at a 1:6 dilution to simulate mini-pool testing. Results/Findings: A total of 1,776,190 blood donations were screened using cobasV R Zika.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Singapore reported its first locally transmitted Zika case on 26 August 2016. The numbers rose rapidly to 386 cases by the end September, with eight clusters (hotspots) of cases island-wide. Zika virus (ZIKV) shares the same mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, as the Dengue viruses and can caused microcephaly in unborn fetuses of infected pregnant women and Guillan-Barr e syndrome, which hastened Singapore's Blood Services Group (BSG) to look into securing the safety of blood supply from the Zika threat. We aimed to assess the assay performance of USA-FDA investigational (IND) Procleix ZIKV nucleic acid technology (NAT) assay for universal blood donation screening in Singapore to prevent transfusion-transmitted Zika infection. Study Design/Method: All blood donations were screened for Zika with the Procleix ZIKV NAT assay since 1 October 2016. Zika NAT reactive samples were tested at Blood System Research Institute (BSRI) for Zika RNA in plasma and red cells by PCR and for Zika and Dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. A Zika confirmed case was defined by the presence of Zika RNA by PCR and/or Zika antibodies. The analytical sensitivity was evaluated using 300 blinded frozen samples consisting of 25 replicates of 11 half log dilutions of the WHO International Standard for ZIKV and 25 replicates of negative controls prepared by BSRI. Probit analysis was performed to determine the 50% and 95% limits of detection (LOD) . Clinical performance of the Procleix ZIKV assay was also assessed with local patient samples obtained from Institute of Infectious Disease and Epidemiology, Singapore and a 14 member blinded ZIKV reference panel from the USA-FDA. Results/Finding: A total of 63,144 donations were screened from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017, with 1 false positive case and 1 Zika confirmed donation detected. Alternative ZIKV PCR tested positive in both the plasma and red cells with an estimated plasma viral load of 9.54x10 5 copies/ml. Zika IgM was negative in the index donation sample but present in the 10-day post-donation follow up sample.. The donor reported no clinical symptoms. The analytical sensitivity for the Procleix ZIKV assay was determined to be 2.1 copies/ml at 50% LOD and 10.0 copies/ml at 95% LOD. The Procleix ZIKV assay detected RNA in 6 out of 9 patient samples and provided 85.7% agreement to the results of the USA-FDA ZIKV reference material. Conclusion: The investigational Procleix ZIKV assay showed good analytical sensitivity and clinical performance, suitable for blood screening of Zika infection especially in asymptomatic donor populations. BSG commenced universal Zika NAT screening by individual donation testing following the Zika outbreak with 1 confirmed Zika donation (high-titer and seronegative) interdicted, which translates to a risk incidence of 1 in 25,888 donations in Singapore. Background/Case Studies: A CAP/AABB Work Group suggested that steps be taken to phase in RHDgenotyping for patients with a serologic weak D phenotype. Weak D types 1, 2 and 3 express all the major RhD epitopes and these patients can be managed as RhD-positive, which may lead to a reduction in unnecessary Rh immunoglobulin (RhIG) administration and conservation of RhD-negative RBCs. Study Design/Method: RHD genotyping was performed on all patient samples with weaker than expected or discrepant RhD typing results, utilizing a commercially available genotyping kit manufactured by Immucor (RHD BeadChip). Initially, testing was performed at a reference lab while the RHD BeadChip was validated and implemented at this institution. A serologic weak D phenotype is defined as weak to 21 reactivity on initial gel testing. If genotyping demonstrated weak D types 1, 2 or 3, the intent was to manage the patient as RhD-positive. If weak D types 1, 2 or 3 were NOT detected, the patient is considered at risk for alloimmunization and treated as RhDnegative. While RHD genotyping results were pending, RhD-negative RBCs were used and if pregnant, the patient was eligible for RhIG. Results were generally available in 2 to 4 weeks. Results/Finding: RHDgenotyping was performed on 22 patient samples over 15 months. Of these 22 patient samples, 13 (59%) were weak D types 1 or 2. The remaining samples demonstrated a variety of alleles including known partial D variants (see Table) . One patient identified as weak D type 1 required multiple transfusions over the study period, and refused RhD-positive RBCs. The remaining weak D types 1 and 2 patients have not received transfusions at this institution since they were genotyped. Four of 4 obstetric weak D types 1 and 2 patients received RhIG while genotyping was pending. Conclusion: Testing and management of patients with serologic weak D phenotypes is not standardized. RHD genotyping may lead to more consistent, personalized patient care and appropriate management of resources. In this 15 month study period 13 serologic weak D patients were identified who could be managed as RhD-positive, however this did not result in withholding any doses of RhIG nor conservation of RhD-negative RBCs. Genotyping results pertaining to the management of an obstetric patient were discussed with each obstetrician and it is possible this information may impact management of future pregnancies. These outcomes highlight the limitations of current genotyping processes, including long turn-around-time Background/Case Studies: The RH blood group is highly immunogenic and the most clinically significant blood group secondary only to ABO. Currently, in the United States, blood donors who type RhD-negative by serology undergo weak-D testing to identify some weak and partial states of RhD expression. However, not all RhD expression can be detected serologically. It has been suggested that investigation of serologic RhD-negative blood donors using genotyping methods can more accurately identify units that may lead to alloimmunization in RhD-negative recipients. Study Design/Method: RHD genotyping of all serologic RhD-negative blood donors presenting to our blood donor center was implemented to identify units with altered RHD alleles that should be characterized as RhDpositive. Repeat donations were not tested. Initial serologic testing of blood donors was performed using 3 FDA approved anti-D reagents. When reactivity with all 3 reagents was negative, RHD genotyping was performed using a commercially available genotyping kit manufactured by Immucor (RHD BeadChip). This assay detects over 80 RHD variant alleles and additional DNA sequencing was performed in selected cases. To maximize efficiency samples were batched for testing; testing was generally performed once a month. If an RHD variant known or suspected to be associated with an increased risk of alloimmunization was detected, recipients of previous donations were investigated for evidence of alloimmunization, and all future donations were restricted to RhD-positive recipients. Results/Finding: Over a period of 8 months we tested 509 RhD-negative blood donors. There were 3 (0.6%) partial-D, 1 weak D (0.2%), and 3 (0.6%) DEL donors. In one donor sample a novel RhD allele was identified through DNA sequencing (RHD*IVS5-46_42delTCTC). The phenotype associated with this allele variant is unknown. Investigation of previous donations from these 8 donors showed that 6 RhD-negative recipients received RBCs from 4 of these donors. Five of these recipients underwent antibody screening after an average follow-up period of 5 months; anti-D was not detected in any sample (See Table) . Conclusion: Serologic testing occasionally fails to identify some RhDpositive donor units, which could place RhD-negative recipients at risk for alloimmunization. DNA-based testing can be used to identify donors who have the potential to sensitize RhD-negative individuals. In this limited study period a small number of serologic RhD-negative donors, whose genotype indicated potential to sensitize recipients, were found. However, review of recipient transfusion records indicated that prior exposure to these donors' RBCs did not lead to detectable immunization to date. Future potential sensitizing events will be avoided by restricting these units to RhD-positive recipients. Grifols Diagnostic Solutions Labs, 5 Grifols Immunohematology Center",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Pregnant women with RHD variants may be candidates for RhIG prophylaxis if molecular analysis reveals a genotype associated with possible anti-D formation. Proposed testing algorithms advocate molecular characterization of weak D types but if a patient types as RhD-positive, no further action is proposed. Women with partial D variants who may also be at risk of anti-D formation have not been included in algorithms proposed to date yet molecular testing may unmask this hidden subpopulation of women who type as D-positive but who may be candidates for RhIG prophylaxis. Our hospital is in an urban setting in which 63% of deliveries are to African-American patients. We initiated routine, full-gene RHDsequencing for obstetric patients whose serology demonstrated not only weak D, but also those who were categorized as \"D1\" with 31 reactivity to determine the prevalence of partial D patients in an ethnically-mixed population who may be at risk of anti-D formation. Study Design/Methods: From October 2016 to March 2017, we performed routine D typing (NEO, Immucor) on 1875 obstetric specimens followed by RHD sequencing on samples with either a serologic weak D phenotype or anti-D testing strength of 31 using at least 1 antibody. Solid phase and manual testing used the series 4 and series 5 reagents. Four additional anti-D reagents manufactured by Grifols (DG Gel Anti-D), Quotient (Anti-D blend), Biorad (Anti-D (RH1) blend), and Ortho (BioClone Anti-D) were also used for supplemental testing. RHD sequencing was performed by Sanger methodology using routine clinical protocols. Results/Findings: RHD polymorphisms or variations were identified in all 13 samples. Two of 13 (15.4%) were D1 with an RHD gene with only common, known intronic variants that is predicted to produce the \"reference\" RhD protein (IVS1-29C, rs2301153; IVS3 1 117C, rs28521909; and IVS3 1 124A, rs28562109). Two (15.4%) were D1 and heterozygous for two apparently new RHD coding variations which we are confirming by further testing. Four (30.8%) patients had RHD alleles with known potential to make anti-D (RHD*DOL2, RHD*DAR1.2, and 2 with weak D type 4.0). One had weak D type 96, which has uncertain susceptibility to alloimmunization and one was weak D type 1, which has not yet been associated with anti-D. Interestingly, two (15.4%) had variable D expression associated with apparently new alleles, pending ongoing confirmatory testing and cloning. One patient Background/Case Studies: A weak D type 2 is a variant of the RhD protein that comprises an amino acid substitution located in the 12th transmembrane segment and expresses a reduced amount of the D antigen. This variant is known to be associated with the missense mutation c.1154 G>C which is the first nucleotide of the exon 9 of the RHD gene and thus could be implicated in exon 9 skipping when it is mutated. When performing NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) analysis to fully genotype known patients, we identified an additional variant. Study Design/Method: DNA samples were studied by Beadchip technology (Immucor/Bioarray solutions) and NGS using the SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) and the Nextseq500 platform. In silico analysis with different bioinformatic tools was used to predict splicing events. Furthermore, a functional splicing assay was performed to determine the impact of the nucleotide variations on exon 9 skipping of RHD gene. This study was completed by the comparative modeling between the wild type and the weak type 2 RhD proteins. Results/Finding: By a targeted analysis of full exome sequencing, we have confirmed the blood group genotype of 10 patients previously characterized by BeadChip technology. Interestingly, 4 out of 10 carry the c.1154-31C>T intronic variation on the RHD gene, already described and associated with a Del allele. Among these last 4 patients, one has been previously characterized as RHD weak type 2 carrying the c.1154G>C (p.Gly385Ala). Independently, Sanger sequencing on 50 unrelated RHD weak type 2 samples pinpoint to a linkage disequilibrium between c.1154G>C (ExAC, MAF 5 0.001145) and the c.1154-31C>T (ExAC, MAF 5 0.2496). In silico analysis of both mutation located close to the splice acceptor site of the exon 9 does not predict a significant reduction of its strength score. With minigene vectors harboring RHD wildtype exon 9, mutant RHD c.1154G>C, mutant RHD c.1154-31C>T and double RHD mutants c.1154G>C plus c.1154-31C>T, we showed no influence on skipping of exon 9 due to these mutations. Comparative modeling of RhD proteins pointed out an additional hydrophobic interaction on the RhD weak type 2 between Ala385 (transmembrane helix 12) and Val183 (transmembrane helix 6) hampering membrane insertion. Conclusion: The c.1154-31C>T variation is always associated in cis with the missense mutation c.1154G>C on the allele RHD weak type 2. The c.1154-31C>T can be found alone on the RHD gene as a neutral polymorphism. We assess that these two mutations isolated or combined do not lead to abnormal RHD transcripts. Our results clearly demonstrate that the weak D antigen reactivity observed with RhD type 2 red blood cells is due to the substitution of alanine at amino acid position 385 to glycine.",

Numerous single-nucleotide missense variants (SNMVs) weaken or abolish expression of Jk a/b antigens determined at p.280. We mapped all reported Jk-weak or Jk-negative (Jk-neg) SNMVs onto the HUT-B structure to explore topological correlates of Jk antigen expression. Study Design/Methods: JK*A and JK*B SNMVs affecting Jk expression were compiled from dbRBC and ISBT registries, literature searches and 2010-2016 AABB, ISBT and British Blood Transfusion Society meeting abstracts. SNMV locations were correlated with the human homolog of the x-ray-crystallographic structure of mammalian UT-B derived for analysis of UT function (Levin EJ, 2012) . Results/Finding: Seven SNMVs located within 1 amino acid (aa) from the exofacial or internal end of a TM helix are mostly weak variants (Table) . All 3 at the exofacial ends (p.A93T, p.W240R, p.V333D) are Jk-weak; the two Jkneg exceptions p.G298E and p.G299E are at the internal end of the TM helix bearing Jk a/b . Four SNMVs in the cytoplasmic N-terminal segment are mostly weak variants. In contrast, 13 SNMVs within membrane helices are mostly Jk-neg variants. Three Jk-weak SNMVs (p.V10M, p.E44K, p.V76I) have been associated with allo-anti-Jk a/b to the antigen on their alleles (\"weak partial\"). Six of the 13 Jk-neg variants are within 19 aa (p.270-p.299) of Jk a/b at p.280. None of these SNMVs are in the long extracellular connector region or the cytoplasmic C-terminal segment. Jk-neg variants p.N289S and p.S291P are adjacent to p.288F and p.292L which line part of the urea transporter pore. Conclusion: In the transporter-structured RhD and RhCE proteins, SNMVs with weak D, C, c, E or e expression are mostly within the RBC membrane, and non-canonical antigen-negative SNMVs are unusual. In the structurally similar Kidd HUT-B, most Jk-weak SNMVs are at the ends of the TM helices or in the N-terminal cytoplasmic segment. Among 13 Jk-neg SNMVs, most are in membrane helices. However, whether a variant appears Jk-weak or Jk-neg may depend on the extent of testing. Next-generation sequencing may provide more complete structure-antigen correlations. Background/Case Studies: The Kidd-null blood group is most often inherited as a recessive genetic trait due to biallelic mutations in the SLC14A1 gene, which encodes the urea transporter UT-B1. The Kidd-null phenotype is associated with transfusion risk and also is associated with abnormalities in the ability to concentrate urine. The cause of the identical Kidd-null phenotype with dominant inheritance [In(Jk)] has not yet been defined, though it was first described in 1965. In contrast to recessively inherited Kidd-null phenotype, this is not associated with mutations in the SLC14A1 gene. The aims of the studies was to Identify and characterize the causative gene for Dominant Kidd-Null red blood cell phenotype (InJk).",

We performed whole-genome linkage analysis, exome sequencing, expression (RT-PCR and Western) analyses, and Urea lysis using patients' cells. In addition, two probands underwent urine concentration tests. Results/Finding: Using molecular approaches, we mapped the affected locus to a 5 Mbp region in 19q13.11-13.2 with an LOD score of 9.6. Using deep sequencing, we identified a potential deleterious mutation in the ZNF850 gene, which deletes 84 bp resulting in loss of an entire zing finger domain. The identical del84-ZNF850 mutation is present in all affected individuals, and is absent from all controls tested (n>2000). In addition, two adult individuals who are homozygous for the entire haplotype including the deletion within the ZNF850 locus, thus completely lacking the common allele, were identified. We also obtained DNA from an unrelated InJk individual reported from Japan. In this individual, there was a similar, though not identical, ZNF850del84. None of the other potential genetic variants identified in the Spanish kindreds was present in the DNA from the InJk individual from Japan. Consistent with the fact that the Kidd antigen, encoded by the SLC14A1gene, is a urea transporter that has been associated with renal function, we found that people with the ZNF850del84 in Spain had an inability to concentrate their urine. Conclusion: A predicted zinc finger deletion at ZNF850, prevalent in Southern Spain due to a founder mutation, leads to UT-B1 dysfunction and underlies the dominantly inherited Kidd-null blood phenotype. The phenotype associates subnormal urine concentrating ability.",

Study Design/Method: Under an IRB-approved protocol, whole blood from healthy volunteers was collected into sodium citrate and centrifuged at 100 g to separate RBCs from platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP was diluted 3-fold in PIPES-Saline with 1.4mM PGE1 and centrifuged at 1900 g. The platelet pellet was resuspended in either SpDP or FFP and recombined with the packed RBCs to create rWB with hematocrit of 34-40% and 150,000-250,000 platelets/mL. In addition, two rWB pairs were reconstituted with SpDP diluted 1:1 (SpDP50%) with plasma from a patient with Type 3 VW disease (T3VWD). Samples were fluorescently labeled with a GPIIbIIIa-specific antibody and the sample was flowed through a Type I collagen-coated microchannel at a shear rate of 1600 s -1 for 180 seconds. Still images of adherent platelets and thrombi were captured in order to calculate surface area coverage (SA) along the length of the channel. Ratio paired t-test was used to compare SA in samples reconstituted with SpDP vs. FFP. The margin of noninferiority was 20% (SpDP/FFP > 0.8). Results/Finding: Six batches of SpDP/FFP were evaluated using 17 subjects. There was no statistical difference between the SpDP/FFP pairs (P50.7558). The mean ratio of SpDP/FFP was 1.21 with a 95% CI of 0.84 -1.57. Comparing SpDP vs. SpDP50%, there was no difference (median ratio 5 1.045, range: 0.95-1.14) in SA. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated that batch did not significantly affect ratio of SA in SpDP vs. FFP. Conclusion: SpDP, despite a decrease of VWF HMWM, was not inferior to FFP in ability to support platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. On average, SA in samples reconstituted with SpDP was 20% greater than in samples reconstituted with FFP. The lower limit of the 95 th % CI is a difference of 16%, which is less than the a priori determined margin of noninferiority of 20%. Even with 50% dilution with T3VWD plasma, there was no reduction in platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in the SpDP rWB samples. These data support the development of in-human studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SpDP in preventing and reversing trauma-related coagulopathy.",

Platelet adhesion to collagen under shear was measured by BioFlux. Results/Finding: Pretreated SpDP showed enhanced vWF activity over rSpDP (p < .05). Fibrin polymerization density was slightly diminished in rSpDP vs. FFP (0.879 vs. 0.742 O.D., p < .01), but TG was unchanged. Bicarbonate/base excess were lower in SpDP samples vs. FFP (p < 0.001). Residual cellular material (especially platelet-derived) was reduced threefold in rSpDP vs. FFP (p < .01) and an additional twofold in pretreated SpDPs vs. rSpDP (p < .05).

Platelet adhesion was equivalent in pretreated SpDPs and FFP, while rSpDP was improved vs. all other samples (71.53% surface coverage vs. 30.26-43.87%, p < .05). Conclusion: SpDP has a longer shelf life and easier storage requirements than FFP and was equivalent or superior to FFP in most of these in vitro assays. SpDP pretreated with glycine solutions was similar to FFP in most assays and showed superior vWF activity and fewer residual cellular materials but inferior support for platelet adhesion to collagen while under flow compared with untreated SpDP.

Acker 3 , Philip J. Norris 4 , Jennifer A Muszynski 5 and Nicole Juffermans 1 . 1 Academic Medical Center, 2 University of Alberta, 3 Canadian Blood Services, 4 Blood Systems Research Institute, 5 Nationwide Children's Hospital Background/Case Studies: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is associated with acute lung injury, in particular in patients on mechanical ventilation. The causative factor is not known but may include residual cells or extracellular vesicles (EVs) . In this study we investigated the functional effect of different manufacturing methods of RBC products on the response of pulmonary cells in an in vitro model of mechanical ventilation. Study Design/Methods: Groups of RBC products (whole blood filtered [WBF] , red cell filtered [RCF] , apheresis derived [AD] and whole blood derived [WBD]) were manufactured from 8 donors (blood type A or B). Supernatants were prepared after 4-5 (fresh) and 41-42 days of storage (stored) for measurement of thrombin generation and EV analysis. A549 type II alveolar cells were seeded onto flexible membranes and incubated with RBC supernatant. Cells were subjected to 25% stretch using a cellstretcher. Control cells were not stretched. After 24 hours, IL-8 and IL-6 production were measured. Results/Findings: Both fresh and stored supernatants from AD products significantly increased pulmonary cell IL-6 and IL-8 production compared to incubation with other RBC products and non-incubated controls, which was further exacerbated by cell stretching. AD products also had significantly increased thrombin generating ability compared to other RBC products, as well as a significantly increased number of RBC-derived EVs compared to RCF and WBD products (p<0.05) . Incubation of stretched cells with stored WBF products resulted in higher IL-8 production compared to other blood products and stretched controls. RCF products did not activate pulmonary cells, had an absence of TG and had low levels of EVs compared to other products. Conclusion: Manufacturing methods markedly influence the interaction of RBC products with lung cells. AD products activate lung cells, which is further aggravated by cell stretching. This may in part be mediated by RBC-Background/Case Studies: Investigators previously demonstrated immunosuppressive effects of RBC supernatant on monocytes in vitro, with greater effects seen in response to older units. Recent clinical data suggest that RBC manufacturing method may influence immunomodulatory potential, but this has not been directly measured. We used in vitro models to test the hypothesis that RBC supernatants obtained by different manufacturing methods will have differential effects on monocyte function. Study Design/Method: RBC products were manufactured by 4 different methods from 5 individual donors, each: (whole blood filtration [WBF] , red cell filtration [RCF] , apheresis, and whole blood derived [WBD] ). RBC products were stored in SAGM (WBF and RCF) or ADSOL-containing preservative solution (apheresis and WBD). Supernatants were obtained after 4-5 days (fresh) and 41-42 days (expiry). Monocytes were co-cultured in media plus 20% RBC supernatant or media only (control) followed by LPS stimulation. Experiments were performed in 5 replicates, each with a distinct monocyte donor.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The amount of hemolysis in red blood cell units increases as the product ages and has been shown to be lower in female blood donors than in males. It is hypothesized that female donors possess, on average, a younger population of red cells, which results in the lower hemolysis that is observed in the pre-menopausal population. It is also hypothesized that the differences between donor populations are mitigated by lysis of older cells when whole blood units undergo processing steps to produce red cell concentrate (RCC) units. As red blood cells (RBCs) age in circulation, they undergo characteristic changes in density and membrane composition that allows for them to be separated from younger cells. Study Design/Method: Our aim is to study the effect of donor factors and method of manufacturing and storing conditions on the average RBC age and density of red cell units. We have recently developed a powerful yet simple and inexpensive magnetic levitation-based platform, which allows realtime, high-resolution imaging and monitoring of various cell populations. This label-free system allows density profiling for individual red blood cells, with an unprecedented resolution of 10 -4 g/mL. First, to determine the effect of RCC storage on the density profile of RBCs, levitation and single-cell density profiles were measured at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days. In addition, to determine the effect of donor age and sex on the RBC density profile, blood samples from 24 volunteers with four different age and sex categories (Male, 18-40 years; Male, >60 years; Female, 18-40 years; Female, >60 years) were profiled. Results/Finding: First, we observed that the levitation and density profiles as well as morphology of RBCs within RCC units change significantly during storage. In addition, RBC density was significantly different between young (1.098 g/mL) and older female donors (1.109 g/mL) (p < 0.01). Moreover, RBCs from young males (1.096 g/mL) were significantly less dense compared to RBCs profiled from older female donors (1.109 g/mL) (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We have developed a magnetic levitation system for the point-of-care, real-time evaluation of RBC and red cell concentrate (RCC) quality. We envision our results might inform decision makers about impact that donor deferral criteria may be having on the quality of red cell concentrates available in the blood banks, for the optimal clinical outcomes.",

Redox imbalance caused by a higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species or a decrease in endogenous protective antioxidants results in oxidative stress (OS). While OS can cause cellular injury and death, it is also important in the regulation of a healthy immune response to injury or disease. In the present study we investigated changes in hemoglobin, free heme, and ORP as red blood cells (RBC) age and the effects of red blood cell age on ICU patient morbidity and mortality. Study Design/Method: 120 ICU patients were enrolled in this prospective observational trial investigating the effect of transfused RBC age on ICU patient morbidity and mortality.

There were no differences in ORP values between the different blood groups once RBC age was controlled for and there were no statistically significant differences in patient mortality associated with ORP, free heme/hemoglobin, or RBC age. The decreased ORP values observed in the older blood are likely attributable to the \"storage lesion\". Higher transfused RBC ORP values were associated with subsequent development of infection, and younger RBCs were found to have higher ORP values. Thus, this data supports that young/fresher blood may predispose to subsequent development of infection in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed. Background/Case Studies: No randomized trials in humans have addressed whether only exposure to red blood cells (RBCs) that have been stored for a long time is associated with harm. We explore the effect on inhospital mortality of transfusing RBCs stored for more than 35 days compared to RBCs stored for 7 days or less. Study Design/Method: Data from a multi-national randomized controlled trial were used for this exploratory analysis. The patients were hospitalized adults who required transfusions and were randomly allocated to receive the freshest RBCs in inventory or the oldest (standard issue) RBCs providing a large cohort of patients receiving RBCs with storage durations along the entire RBC storage continuum of 1 to 42 days. Using a time dependent variable patient exposure was defined by the maximum storage duration of RBCs received. This was then used to classify individuals on each day of hospitalization into one of three mutually exclusive exposure categories: freshest (exclusively exposed to RBCs less than or equal to 7 days storage duration -reference group), medium age (at least 1 RBC of 8-35 days storage), and oldest (at least 1 RBC greater than 35 days storage). The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Cause-specific Cox regression models of in-hospital death assessed the effect of exposure of RBCs in each category to exclusive exposure to RBCs stored for 7 days or less. The effects of fixed and time-dependent confounders were dealt with through stratification and regression. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with a) weekly partition with cut-points every 7 days, and b) a finer partition using cut-points every 3 days. Results/Finding: 24,726 patients receiving 90,530 RBCs were included in the analysis. Exposure to RBCs stored for more than 35 days was not associated with increased risk of in-hospital death compared with exposure exclusively to the freshest RBC units (stored for 7 days or less) after adjusting for several fixed and time-dependent potential confounders (HR 5 0.91; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.14; p 5 0.400). Exposure to blood stored for at most 8-35 days yielded a similar hazard ratio (HR 5 0.90; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.10; p 5 0.295). In the sensitivity analyses using weekly partitions, exposure to RBCs stored for greater than 35 days compared to exclusive exposure to RBCs stored 7 days or less was not significant (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.72, 1.14; p 5 0.381). The confidence intervals around the hazard ratios for the other 7-day intervals all include 1. Similar findings were obtained with partitioning exposure data into 3 day intervals where exposure to RBCs stored for 40-42 days was not associated with increased risk of death compared with exclusive exposure to RBCs stored for 1-3 days (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.37, 1.83; p 5 0.635). The confidence intervals around the hazard ratios for the other 3-day intervals all include 1. Conclusion: Individuals exposed to RBCs stored for more than 35 days were not at increased risk of in-hospital death compared to individuals exposed exclusively to RBCs stored for 7 days or less.",

In parallel to controlling the hemorrhage, clinicians respond by infusing large volumes of red blood cells (RBCs) to restore blood volume, O 2 carrying capacity, and hemodynamic stability. The quality of the transfused RBCs determines the recovery from HS, and extent of clinical sequelae prompted by the HS. This study compares the ability to recover from HS with conventionally stored RBCs, anaerobically (O 2 saturation <10%) stored RBCs, or anaerobic/hypercapnic (O 2 saturation <10% and pCO 2 (@378C) $70mmHg) stored RBCs. Study Design/Method: Packed red blood cells (pRBCs) stored in AS-3 after leukorfiltration were created from donor Sprague-Dawley rats. pRBC units were randomly stored under either 1) conventional; 2) anaerobic; or 3) anaerobic/hypercapnic conditions. Rats (150-200g) were hemorrhaged to 50% of blood volume, held in hypovolemia for 30 minutes, and resuscitated to recover blood pressure to 90% pre-hemorrhage with pRBC stored for either 1 or 3 weeks. Systemic hemodynamics, cardiac function, and blood gas parameters were monitored during shock and resuscitation; and vital organ inflammation, oxygenation, and function were evaluated post resuscitation.

The low response rates seen in both groups may result from biased selection. The need for repeat T&S and presumed repeat transfusions may be preselecting patients with more aggressive disease. Also, only a small number of patients were suitable for review. A larger prospective study that controls for such variables is needed.",

Division of Transfusion Medicine, Harborview Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Traditional definitions of massive transfusions -e.g., the transfusion of ten or more units of red blood cells (RBCs) in a 24-hour period -are limited in prospectively identifying patients requiring massive transfusions, excluded patients who may not survive long enough to meet criteria, or ignored the acuity of the event. To address these issues, a level I trauma center adopted the critical administration threshold (CAT) as an additional indication for activating its massive transfusion protocol (MTP). This study reviewed blood utilized during massive transfusion events based upon whether the MTP was provider-activated versus CAT-triggered. Study Design/Method: All massive transfusion events between January and April 2017 were reviewed to identify the start time, termination time, number of components transfused, and the start time of each component transfused. The transfusion of three or more blood components in an hour defined CAT. A massive transfusion was any event in which the concern for hemorrhagic shock either necessitated a provider to activate the MTP or blood components were transfused at a rate that met CAT criteria. The massive transfusion start time is based on either the time the provider activated the MTP or the time the first blood component was transfused, whichever came first. Unless the patient expired first, the termination of the massive transfusion event was determined by identifying the point in time in which the patient went three or more hours without the transfusion of any additional blood components. This information was tabulated to determine the monthly number of provider-activated MTPs, CAT-triggered MTPs, and average blood component transfused per massive transfusion.",

However, the mode for both groups suggests that most massive transfusion require less blood components than the average rate. Using the mode provides an approximate 24% replacement of blood volume. This should be enough to counter the early signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic shock. Though this study did not review the appropriateness of provider-activated MTPs, using CAT as an indicator ensures clinicians are prepared for a potential massive transfusion. Further investigation is needed to determine the factors contributing to the downward trend of the average blood components transfused. The mode would suggest optimistically that patients are being stabilized faster and resuscitated more efficiently. If this is the case, defining massive transfusion should include the rate of components transfused in addition to the total volume transfused.",

They may cause a number of false positives, including positive direct antiglobulin tests (DAT), indirect antiglobulin tests (IAT), and panreactivity in eluates. Such results can prolong compatibility testing and delay delivery of blood products for patients. Treating reagent red cells (rRBCs) with 0.2M dithiothreitol (DTT) removes drug interference due to daratumumab and allows for the detection of underlying alloantibodies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of DTT-treatment on rRBC antigen integrity over a 28 day period. Study Design/Method: Twelve aliquots of human plasma, each containing an antibody of a single, known specificity (anti-D, -C, -E, -c, -e, -M, -S, -s, -Fy a , -Fy b , -Jk a , and -Jk b ), were tested against untreated and 0.2M DTTtreated rRBCs (Immucor Panoscreen I, II, III; DTT from Acros Organics). DTT treatment of rRBCs was performed using the methodology described in the AABB Technical Manual (18 th edition). Each of the 12 plasma aliquots was further separated into 28 aliquots and stored at -208C until day of use. Fresh aliquots were thawed each day to avoid unintended antibody integrity degradation. A Polyethylene Glycol (Immucor) enhancement technique was used and reactions were read at the IAT phase. Hemolysis, if present, was observed in the diluent each day prior to mixing the cell suspension and given a grade based on the Haemonetics color comparator chart. Serological antibody reaction strengths were observed and documented each day. (25) A monthly breakdown for both groups also displayed a downward trend in the average use of blood components.",

Advance DTT-treatment and storage of a large aliquot of rRBCs may serve to increase efficiency in the transfusion service. Background/Case Studies: Monocyte monolayer assay (MMA) is a cellular bioassay used to evaluate the hemolytic significance of blood group antibodies and aid in the selection of RBCs for alloimmunized patients. The requirement for fresh auto/allogenic monocytes for MMA is highly restrictive due to tedious processing of fresh peripheral blood (PB). Our previous study described processing and cryopreservation of buffy-coat (BC) derived and fresh PB-monocytes for MMA assay. The aim was to evaluate the functional properties of cryopreserved BC-monocytes as substitute for fresh PBmonocytes in MMA in evaluation of previously reported clinically significant RBC alloantibodies. Study Design/Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy-coats (Histopaque-10771), pooled, suspended in cryopreservation media (20% DMSO; 1:1) and stored in liquid nitrogen. PBMC membrane integrity post-thaw was determined by trypan blue exclusion. PBMCs were cultured on poly-L-lysine-treated coverslips (378C, 5% CO 2 , 1 h) and monocyte monolayers incubated with fresh or cryopreserved antigen positive (O1) RBCs sensitized with either anti-D (positive control), anti-Scianna-2 (Sc2) or anti-AnWj or lipopolysaccharide stimulated for 2 h. Aliquots of the sensitized RBCs were tested for opsonization by indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). Phagocytosis index (PI) was determined microscopically as the number of fully phagocytosed RBCs/100 monocytes. Supernatants were analyzed for cytokines using Luminex technique. Results/Findings: Cryopreserved PBMCs showed 96.2 6 1% viability postthaw. We report no significant difference in phagocytosis of anti-D sensitized RBCs by cryopreserved monocytes vs fresh monocytes. We show a significant increase in TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-a (p < 0.01), MIP-b and GRO (p < 0.05) secretion from cryopreserved BC monocytes vs both fresh BC and PB-monocytes. Sc2-and AnWj-sensitised RBCs resulted in a PI of 9.2 6 2% and 60.2 6 6.4% respectively vs anti-D sensitized RBCs (PI: 72 6 8.7%). A weak (11) reactivity by IAT was observed for anti-AnWj sensitized RBCs while anti-D sensitized RBCs resulted in 41 IAT reactivity. These results correlated with previously reported results for clinical significance and MMA when using freshly obtained autologous or healthy donor monocytes.",

EGA-treated RBCs gave 31 reactions with the same anti-C reagent. Patient 1 RBCs gave variable reactivity (vw-11) with Bio-Rad Seraclone and Ortho BioClone anti-C. Patient 2 RBCs gave 11 reactivity with all 3 anti-C reagents when incubated for the maximum incubation time allowed. Patient 3 RBCs were Jk(a1) with Immucor Gammaclone anti-Jk a , which the manufacturer states is suitable for testing DAT1RBCs, but predicted Jk(a-) by HEA. EGA-treated RBCs tested Jk(a-) with the same reagent. RBCs from patients 4 and 5 tested S1 with Bio-Rad Seraclone anti-S (3-41), but predicted S-by HEA. Further testing with Immucor Gammaclone anti-S showed RBCs from both patients were S-. EGA-treated RBCs from both were non-reactive with both anti-S reagents. Conclusion: Commercial monoclonal reagents are valuable resources, especially when phenotyping DAT1 RBCs but not all manufacturers include reagent limitations regarding testing of DAT1 RBCs. We describe 2 cases of false negative tests with monoclonal anti-C due to antigen blocking by IgG, and 3 cases with false positive tests with anti-S (n52) and anti-Jk a (n51) typing. False positive tests would potentially be anticipated, but false negative results due to antigen blocking are unexpected. Extended incubation as indicated in the reagent insert may reveal weak reactivity when antigen blocking is involved. Results concordant with DNA testing were obtained with EGA-treated RBCs, but it is generally accepted that this is not necessary when using a direct-agglutinating monoclonal reagent. These cases caution the potential for both false negative and false positive results for samples with 3-41 positive DAT and supports testing to dissociate IgG from RBCs strongly DAT1 before antigen typing. In addition, this report highlights the benefits of DNA testing as part of the routine reference laboratory workup. Background/Case Studies: Sensitization to antigens expressed on transfused cells, by triggering premature antibody-mediated clearance, diminishes the therapeutic effectiveness of transfusion and may also lead to serious delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. Accepted US clinical practice, while providing that sensitized patients receive only cells lacking \"offending\" antigens, nevertheless ensures continued alloexposure, and thus possible sensitization, to additional antigens, thereby complicating patient management. To mitigate sensitization risk, especially in an era of increasingly cost-conscious procurement, a quantitative assessment of the immunogenicity of specific antigens will be desirable. Giblett, long ago, introduced a relative scale relating the RBC antigen immunogenicities to (an assumed) immunogenicity of \"K\" (http://bit.ly/2opqFew ). Here, we show that an absolute estimate of immunogenicities may be extracted directly from observed antibody counts provided these are properly normalized to the fraction of recipients at risk (namely those lacking a specific antigen) and the expected fraction of donors expressing that antigen. Study Design/Method: We define immunogenicity, or sensitization risk, r, for any antigen (\"Ag\") of interest, as the conditional probability of alloantibody (\"Ab\") formation, given allo-exposure to Ag, i.e. r :5 prob(Ab|al-loExp), so that prob(Ab) 5 prob(Ab|alloExp)*prob(alloExp) and 0 r 1; rewriting prob(alloExp) 5 prob(Recipient, \"R\", lacks Ag)*prob(Donor , \"D\" has Ag); and estimating prob(Ab) 5 nAb/nR, nAb denoting the number of Ab in nR recipients, we obtain: nAb/(nR*prob(R lacks Ag)) 5 r * prob(D has Ag), the left-hand side representing the observed sensitized fraction, U, i.e. the number of observed Ab in relation to the number of recipients at risk. Conclusion: Several antigens, though corresponding antibodies may be rare (e.g. \"Jsa\", \"e\", \"U\"), nevertheless are highly immunogenic, requiring only a single exposure (on average) for sensitization; in contrast, others (on average) will require many exposures and thus pose a relatively low risk. In conjunction with patient genotypes, our r -scale will facilitate the selection of patient-specific cells so as to minimize the risk of (proliferating) alloimmunization even when perfectly matched cells are not available. Our approach may be readily extended to additional RBC antigens and other antigen systems. Background/Case Studies: AABB and FDA require a 12 month deferral of donors with a tattoo applied using non-sterile needles or reusable ink. We review state regulations to ascertain if tattoo establishments are licensed and required to use sterile or single-use needles and single-use ink. We recently added two large states in which we collect blood to the Acceptable States List (ASL). We compared the rates of donors deferred before and after the addition of these states to determine potential donor gain with changes in state tattoo licensing regulations. Study Design/Method: We analyzed allogeneic interview responses to the screening question, \"In the past 12 months have you had a tattoo?\" and if 'yes', whether the tattoo was applied by a state regulated entity. Blood centers in 2 states were selected for the analysis before and after state tattoo regulation. In State A, a comparison period of similar 3 months before (2/ 2015 -4/2015) and 3 months after (2/2016 -4/2016) was selected; for State B, a similar 4 months before (12/2015 -3/2016) and 4 months after (12/2016 -3/2017) was selected. Frequency and rate of responses were compared in before and after periods. Among those who responded to having a tattoo in a regulated state, donations were reviewed for presence of infectious disease markers including HIV, HBV and HCV. Results/Finding: A higher proportion of donors presenting to give blood admitted to having a recent (<12 months) tattoo in the post period in both states. This increase occurred immediately following the addition of States A and B to the ASL (data not shown). Among those who responded yes to having a tattoo, in States A and B respectively, there was a 13-and 3-fold increase in accepted donors (Table) . The absolute number of accepted donors with tattoos increased from 13 to 567 (State A) and 151 to 1,496 (State B), which annualized, represents a potential gain of 2,216 (State A) and 4,035 (State B) additional donations. All donors who had a tattoo in regulated states (ASL) tested negative for HIV, HBV and HCV. Conclusion: To counter rising numbers of ineligible donors resulting from recently added deferrals, we considered recovery of donors deferred for tattoos as a way to enhance our donor base. The immediate rise in the number of donors reporting a tattoo following the addition of the 2 states may reflect a decline in self-deferrals based on having had a recent tattoo. We demonstrated an increase in the potential number of donations without compromising safety. Background/Case Studies: Transgender donors represent a small fraction of blood donors. Determining their eligibility to donate has been challenging for blood centers. To assess behavioral risk, the donor is required to answer gender specific questions. The same is true when assessing TRALI risk where the donor is asked about a history of prior pregnancies. Prior to the implementation of the FDA's Final Rule, blood centers asked donors for their birth gender and determined eligibility based on that gender. If the donor changed their gender they were asked to answer both the male and female questions. The Final Rule now allows blood centers to accept the donor's stated gender and to determine eligibility based on that gender. In order to assess the risk of failing to ask a transgender male donor (birth gender female) the pregnancy question, a review was done to determine the number of transgender males who were actively donating with a large blood center. and tracked. Donors were contacted to resolve any descrepancies. Donors who had changed their gender from female to male and who had answered yes to prior pregnancies were identified. HLA antibody test results were reviewed for these donors to see if they had been tested and whether they had tested positive or negative. Results/Finding: From 2013 -2015 , there were 181 donors identified who had changed their gender from their birth gender; 121 female donors changed their gender to male and 60 male donors changed their gender to female. There were 7 (6%) transgender male donors, birth gender female, who had answered yes to the pregnancy question at one of their donations. Three of these donors were apheresis donors who had been tested for HLA antibodies. One tested positive and the other two tested negative for HLA antibodies. The four other donors were whole blood donors and had not been tested. An HLA test was added to these donors' records so that the test could be performed the next time they presented to donate. Conclusion: Transgender male donors may have had prior pregnancies and are also choosing to become pregnant after having transitioned from female to male. Six percent of transgender males that we identified reported a prior history of pregnancy. At our center, when a donor requests a gender change from female to male, an HLA test is requested for the next donation. First time donors are qualified based on their stated gender so transgender donors with a history of pregnancy will not be identified unless they volunteer this information. Consideration should be given to using educational materials to prompt the donor to reveal a history of pregnancy at the time of donation so that HLA antibody testing can be performed.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Regulations allow whole blood donation [WBD] of up to 10.5 mL/kg or 15% of estimated blood volume [EBV] . Traditional measuring/mixing devices are set to halt blood flow at fixed volumes which, with testing samples, are consistently below the 15% limit. Variable volume scales [VVS] can be programmed to vary unit volume (up to 550 mL) by donor EBV. This maximizes transfusable RBCs and plasma and recovered plasma [RP] volume. RP from WBDs is a small but important source of derivatives and blood center cost recovery. We report the effect of introducing the Hemoflow VVS on donor reaction rates and RP volume in a large blood center. Compared to previous fixed settings, variable collection volumes were expected to decrease by 10 mL at EBVs <3.5L in donors !23 yo, but increase by 5-40 mL for all others. Study Design/Method: Donor vasovagal reaction [VVR] rates (prefaints, prolonged/offsite reactions, and loss of consciousness [LOC]) for successful WBDs were obtained from the center's hemovigilance database for the 18 mos. before a 6 mo. phased implementation of the VVS, and the subsequent 24 mos. Multivariable analysis [MVA] by 6-mo. periods was performed in a model incorporating donor sex, age, first-time [FTD] vs. repeat status, EBV and donation site. Both the volume and number of units of plasma sent for fractionation were available for the same time periods from the blood center's data warehouse. Results/Finding: Compared to the baseline period, a significant increase in prefaint reaction rates were noted in Pre-Implementation (Impl) periods 1 & 2, continued during Impl and Post-Impl periods 1 & 2, returning to the baseline rate in Post-Impl periods 3 & 4 (Table) . More severe reactions showed an increasing trend that only became significant in Post-Impl periods 3 & 4. The MVA showed the VVS as independent factor contributing to the increased prefaint and more severe reactions. However, its contribution, as measured by odds ratios, was consistently lower than those exerted by known donor determinants of reaction rates: young age, low EBV, FTD status and collection site (not shown). Plasma unit volume increased an average of 3.8 mL during Post-Impl periods 1 & 2 from the temporally matched baseline & Pre-Impl period 1. Conclusion: Following an initial increase in mild VVRs during and immediately after implementation of the VVS, VVR rates fell back to baseline, suggestive of transient staff distraction from usual donor care, or a minor effect of increased blood loss with a superimposed improvement trend. The subsequent increase in prolonged/offsite reactions and LOC after prefaint reactions had already returned to baseline suggests that staff training, work load, donor compliance with mitigation strategies and other determinants of donor reactions have a far greater effect than the small additional blood loss due to the VVS. Small but significant increments in RP volume improve derivative availability and offset the cost of the VVS.",

Citrate reaction (CR) results from various degrees of hypocalcemia in donors. Blood volumes taken from donors vary according to type of procedure and use of volume replacement. Loss of blood volume is in part responsible for the occurrence of vasovagal reactions (VVR). This analysis was conducted to estimate the incidence of CR and VVR according to various types of apheresis procedures performed at our blood center. (YFV) were reported in Some Brazilian states -Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, mainly. The vectors of those cases were mosquitoes from the Haemagogus and Sabethes genders, whose habitat is the tropical forests. Since many Brazilian urban areas are very close to rain forests, there is an outbreak risk in those areas, where the infection is transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. In order to minimize this risk, Rio de Janeiro health authorities decided to promote a mass vaccination in late March, 2017. The vaccine is produced with live and attenuated YFV, which can circulate for at least 4 weeks after vaccination. In some individuals, the vaccine can elicit viscerotropic effects and sometimes severe diseases. Due to that, Brazilian blood regulation authority established a 4 week deferral period after YFV vaccination. This action could dramatically affect the availability of blood donors. This study shows the measures taken by Rio de Janeiro blood center to circumvent this risk and attract more donors. Study Design/Method: The strategy consisted in offering the population, at a single place -the blood center -the possibility to donate blood and, immediately after donation, to get vaccinated against YFV. There were no financial advantages to the donors, since YFV vaccine is completely free of charge for any Brazilian citizen. The vaccine was administrated by trained nurses, in an office close to the donors session. If, for any reason, the prospective donors were not able to donate, the vaccine was also offered to them, provide there were no contraindications. The blood center annnounced just before the mass vacination campaign launching that it would vaccinate 600 people who came to the blood center to donate blood. If, for any reason, the prospective donors were not able to donate, the vaccine was also offered to them, provide there were no contraindications. Results/Finding: During the five days of campaign, we received 3,351 blood donors candidates; from those, 2,449 were accepted as a blood donor, after medical interview. The deferral rate was 26.9%. At the same period of the year 2016, there were 1,215 prospective donors, and 883 blood donations. The deferral rate was 27.3%. The \"Get vaccinated against YFV . . .but give blood before\" campaign was able to attract, in a five day period, 1,566 additional donors, compared to 2016 same dates. That represents a 177.34% increase in the number of blood donations, without deferral rate increment. There was a slight increase in the proportion of first-time donors, from 42.7% in 2016 to 45.8% in 2017. Conclusion: The strategy was more than successful, and it allowed the blood center to build a blood inventory large enough to avoid risks of shortage due to mass vaccination against YFV. dose loss which must be accommodated when collecting plt donations to ensure the US plt dose of !3.0x10 11 is met. Currently, Triple Set kits for PR are only approved in Europe. Plt loss, and adjusted apheresis targeting parameters may impact split rate (SR) or products per apheresis procedure. Inventory suitable for PR without impacting US blood center SRs warrants evaluation and optimization. Study Design/Method: 1,000 apheresis collections from 4 centers with different SRs were analyzed. A baseline SR for conventional PC was calculated assuming i) a minimum dose (allowing for production loss) of 3.1 x10 11 for single (S), 6.3x1011 11 for double (D), and 9.5x10 11 for triple (T) conventional PCs, ii) concentration and volume requirements from apheresis device manufacturer were used.",

Subjects were divided into 5 cohorts, receiving increasing doses, ranging from 1/1,000 -1/10 of the lowest effective dose found in the above rabbit model. Cohorts 4 and 5 received the 1/10th dose, but cohort 5 received two 1/20th doses one hour apart. The primary end points were safety and tolerability. Subjects were monitored in-hospital for 24hrs post infusion and followed for up to 60 days for adverse events, global neurological assessments, abbreviated physical exams, and laboratory tests. Results/Findings: There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or subject discontinuation post-infusion due to a significant decrease in platelet count from baseline. There were a total of 68 AEs: 40 were treatment emergent (TEAE), of which 8 were treatment-related (6 Thrombosomes and 2 Control). All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. In cohorts 4 and 5, 3/4 Thrombosomes subjects had treatment related adverse events. One cohort 4 subject developed an upper respiratory infection and elevated WBCs within 8 hours post infusion, which resolved by 24 hours, and an elevated D-dimer at 24 hours post infusion, which resolved by Day 7. This subject also had an elevation of Prothrombin Fragment 1 1 2 at baseline, which increased post transfusion and peaked at 24 hours with resolution by Day 14. One cohort 5 subject developed non-specific T-wave changes at 1 and 2 hours following her 2nd infusion that resolved by Day 21 without clinical symptoms. Troponin levels and ECHO stress tests were normal. EKGs were considered possibly a normal variant or related to placement of the EKG leads. Another cohort 5 subject developed an IgG platelet autoantibody on Days 7-21, which was undetectable on Days 42-60; there was no change in platelet counts. The Thrombosomes autoantibody assay was positive at baseline, Days 7-14, and negative on Days 21-60. Background/Case Studies: Cryopreservation of platelets (PLTs) could extend the shelf life from 5-7 days to over two years. Cryopreserved PLTs (CryoPLTs) appear to have a greater in vivo hemostatic effect than liquidstored PLTs. PLTs have been shown to require protein synthesis capabilities for certain functions such as clot signaling and immune responses. This study was designed to assess whether reconstituted cryo-PLTs carry out protein synthesis upon thawing and short term storage. Study Design/Methods: Apheresis PLTs were cryopreserved with 5% DMSO and stored at 2808C. After thawing, the unit was reconstituted in thawed FFP spiked with either 500 lM puromycin (Pm) or 250 nM biotinlabeled Pm. PLTs were stored at room-temperature with agitation. Samples were drawn immediately after reconstitution as well as after 2, 4 and 24 hours to assess Pm incorporation as a measure of protein synthesis, and for in vitro assays to determine platelet activation by CD62P binding, phosphatidylserine exposure by annexin-V binding and microvesicle count in the supernatant. PLT microvesicles (PMV) were prepared from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation. PLTs and PMV were lysed in a Triton X-100containing buffer and qualitative proteomics was performed on samples following affinity-purification with streptavidin beads. Results/Findings: In vitro parameters of reconstituted and subsequently stored platelets were in line with previously published results, with high surface levels of CD62P and phosphatidylserine. PMVs were generated during cryopreservation and the count increased by 11-fold during 24 hour storage. Immunoblot analyses of the PLTs showed a 2-and 4-fold increase in Pm incorporation after 4 and 24 hours of storage, respectively. Massspectrometry revealed 23 unique proteins that were synthesized after 4 hours of storage, which was confirmed for GTPase and GTPase-regulatory proteins Rac1, Rap1 and RhoGDI by immunoblot analyses. Analyses of the PMV translatome also revealed the presence of synthesized proteins; however, these did not change throughout storage. This finding suggests that a defined panel of proteins is packaged into PMVs upon freezing and thawing. Additionally, the PMV translatome profile comprised a smaller subset of synthesized proteins compared to the cryo-PLT translatome, including the proteins Rac1, Rap1 and RhoGDI.",

Discovery of a subset of these proteins in the PMV suggests their encapsulation, possibly in a selective manner. This observation provides novel insights into the capacity for protein synthesis in cryo-PLTs and the potential regulation of protein packaging into PMV. Background/Case Studies: In 2015, the authors' hospital-based blood bank received variances from the FDA and AABB for the use of cold stored platelets (CSPs) with a shelf life of 3 days. These group A CSPs, stored in a refrigerator in the Emergency Department, were used to support the trauma program for use in massively bleeding patients. The placement of the CSPs on the air ambulances, stored in coolers, was the next logical step in providing platelet therapy sooner to these patients. Study Design/Methods: Eight double unit CSPs were collected using the Trima AccelV R . Two double CSPs were pathogen reduced using the Inter-ceptV R pathogen reduction system. Half of the CSP pairs were subjected to flat storage in a refrigerator; the other half were loaded into a CredoV R 4-496 cooler with 2 units of FFP, 2 units of RBCs, and 1 unit of whole blood. Three to 5mL of platelets were collected via syringe from each unit at 0 min (before storage in cooler or refrigerator) and after 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 6 hours of storage for functional validation of platelets. The platelet count, agonists (thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen stimulated platelets aggregation), non-activated and agonists activated platelet surface expression of phosphatidylserine (PS, annexin-V binding), P-selectin, fibrinogen receptor (PAC-1 binding) were measured by Coulter counter, 2 channel aggregometer, and digital flow cytometer. Paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to analyze differences in degradation rates with p<0.05 deemed significant. Conclusion: Platelets, including pathogen reduced, stored in an oxygendeprived environment, (cooler), do not lose functional capabilities when compared to those platelets stored in a refrigerator with adequate oxygen for 6 hours. Therefore, cold stored platelets transported in a cooler are a viable option for providing timelier platelet intervention for severely injured patients prior to hospital arrival.",

Here, we introduce Molecular Sieving as an alternative to the current approach of managing special donor unit inventories. This novel process for DNA analysis combines the \"multiplexing\" of markers offered by existing genotyping methods with the pooling of multiple samples in manner permitting the step -wise refinement of candidate sets by molecular attribute patterns. Study Design/Method: Molecular Sieving is a special format of LeanSequencing, a proprietary process that permits the simultaneous analysis of up to four samples for alleles encoding 401 RBC antigens in MNS,RHCE, LU,KEL,FY,JK, DI,YT,DO and CO, including the identification of 30 RHCE alleles. Molecular Sieving extends these capabilities to the analysis of pools to attain large scale. Thus, in one format of the process, 4*4*96 samples are accommodated in a single run. Following the completion of the sieving step, candidates may be directly assigned to requests, or may be selected to enrich a subsequent profiling step for samples with rare or otherwise desirable attributes. Here, MolecularSieving was used to identify suitable donor units for 135 sensitized sickle cell anemia (\"SCA\") patients (Tb1 in Cas-tro2002, http://bit.ly/2oplxHr, excluding Le and e(variant) and assuming 1 request per patient), presenting with up to 9 allo-antibodies (\"Ab\") in multiple combinations. Proprietary \"greedy\" algorithms were invoked to optimally pair candidate units with requests. Results/Finding: Sieving of only 1 =2 plate holding 4*48 candidate units from actual black donors, followed by profiling of 44 samples selected to enrich for \"e Neg\" and \"c Neg\" and \"C-E-K-Fya Neg\", produced assignments for 127 of 135 requests (594.1%), as indicated by colors, and shown in the row \"assigned\" below:",

Sieving alone typically fills 65-75% of requests of moderate complexity ( 5 Ab).

The allelic diversity of the predominantly black patient population, especially at the RH locus which encodes a variety of \"partial\" phenotypes further complicates the problem (Chou2013 http://bit. ly/2ppVfEq ). Study Design/Method: Molecular Sieving is a proprietary new process that, in order to rapidly probe candidate donor units in large numbers for multiple phenotype patterns, permits the analysis of pools and pools of pools of samples for a multiplicity of alleles (including 30 at the RHCE locus) that encode 401 MNS, RH, LU, KEL, FY, JK, DI, YT, DO and CO antigens. Based on sieving, samples may be grouped by molecular attribute patterns ranging from single \"Ag2\" (e.g. E2,C2,e2,c2) to specific combinations of \"Ag2\" (e.g. C2E2K2Fya2 and C2E2Jsa2) or combinations of alleles such as those encoding partial RH phenotypes. Sieving, optionally, may be followed by profiling of samples selected for desirable attribute patterns. Genomic DNA from 384 (predominantly) black donors, independently genotyped by one of two commercial methods were provided by LBC. At bmx, 96 pools were prepared prior to amplification, and analyzed by a novel LeanSequencing method. Results/Finding: All pool genotypes were consistent with available individual sample genotypes.

By segregating het pools into subpopulations, we were able to select 6 specific \"eE\" pools of which 4 were demonstrated (in subsequent profiling) to contain an e-sample. We also identified pools \"het\" for alleles indicating the possible presence of a rare donor, for example Yta|b (8 pools), Co a|b (8) and others. Conclusion: MolecularSieving of a single 96-well plate identified many desirable \"antigen-negative\" phenotypes and permitted selection of pools for combinations of \"Ag-neg\" patterns including \"partial:\" RH phenotypes and combinations of C2, E2 and Jsa2. These samples are thus confirmed \"ag Neg\" and available for assignment.

Utilizing experimentally derived haplotype information improves this prediction, as routinely used in HLA typing. Among the 36 blood group systems, however, experimentally derived haplotypes are known for short genes only, such as ICAM4 (Landsteiner-Wiener) and ACKR1 (Duffy). For longer genes, such as ABO of >20 kb, most haplotypes are only statistically derived. We recently established a large dataset of long ERMAP haplotypes, which code for the Scianna blood group system. Study Design/Methods: The nucleotide sequence of >21 kb each was used for all physically confirmed 48 ERMAP alleles that we previously published. Full-length sequences were aligned and variant sites were extracted manually. The Bayesian coalescent algorithm implemented in BEAST v1.8.3 was used to estimate a coalescent phylogeny for these variants and the allelic ancestral states at the internal nodes of the phylogeny. Results/Findings: We found at least 4 clades representing clusters of 5 to 11 alleles. For each clade, one observed allele was identified as the ancestral allele for its cluster of alleles. Using the 4 alleles, we were able to predict alleles with high posterior probability, which were ancestral to the observed alleles and, while not yet observed, may be extant. Conclusion: We explored the phylogenetic structure and evolutionary events underlying the origin of different ERMAP alleles and predict ancestral alleles. In the present study, we show means to predict alleles and to calculate the distinct probabilities of correctness for such predicted alleles. The probabilities can be instrumental in defining a cut-off value to determine which computationally predicted alleles are worth confirming by physical evidence. The alleles identified by studies like ours may be utilized in designing of microarray technologies, imputing of genotypes and mapping of NGS data. The new alleles with nucleotide insertions would be predicted to cause complete loss of expression of the corresponding antigen from a bioinformatics perspective and to encode Group O. Rather very weak expression of the respective antigen and lack of the corresponding antibody in the plasma was found, confirming these represent subgroups of A and B and suggesting that transcriptional slippage, which has been observed before, is responsible for low level antigen expression. ABO genotyping is powerful when both serology and molecular results are evaluated together, and these studies are needed to inform development of bioinformatics tools to accurately associate ABO genotypes with phenotypes. Background/Case Studies: Evolutionarily related ABO and GBGT1 genes encode A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT) and Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS), which catalyze the biosynthesis of A and B, and Forssman (FORS1) oligosaccharide antigens responsible for the ABO and FORS blood group systems, respectively. Human AT and BT possess LeuGlyGly and MetGlyAla, respectively, at codons 266-268, and these tripeptides are important in determining the sugar specificity of enzymes, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) for AT and galactose for BT. Functional FSs possess Gly-GlyAla at the corresponding codons, and exhibit GalNAc specificity. It has been recently shown that human AT gained weak FS activity when the Leu-GlyGly was substituted by GlyGlyAla, suggesting that the tripeptide is involved in the recognition/binding of acceptor substrates, in addition to donor nucleotide-sugar substrates. Study Design/Methods: We have searched for additional mechanisms that might enable human AT to express FORS1. A variety of amino acid substitution constructs of human AT were prepared. Additionally, exon deletion constructs of AT mRNA transcripts were also prepared. DNA from those expression constructs was transfected into COS1(B3GALNT1) cells, and cell-surface expression of FORS1 antigen was immunologically monitored with a monoclonal anti-FORS1 antibody. Results/Findings: We found that Met69Thr/Ser substitutions also conferred human AT with weak FS activity. We also found that the deletion of exon 3 or 4 of human AT transcripts bestowed weak FS activity. Because altered RNA splicing is frequent in cancer, this mechanism may explain, at least partially, the appearance of FORS1 antigen on certain cancer cells and tumors in Forssman antigen-negative human species. Furthermore, the co-introduction of one of those changes together with the GlyGlyAla substitution synergistically conferred strong FS activity, in addition to strong AT and BT activities. Conclusion: The substitution of the GlyGlyAla tripeptide codon in the catalytic domain may modify the acceptor specificity of the enzyme. Met69Thr/ Ser or exon 3/4 deletion may alter the intra-Glogi localization of the enzyme. And those mechanisms function in synergy. The overlapping usage of acceptors by glycosyltransferases encoded by ABO and GBGT1 genes is reminiscent of common ancestral origin of alpha 1,3-Gal(NAc) transferase genes. The finding that AT can synthesize FORS1 implicates that the boundary between ABO and FORS systems may not be as strict as was previously delineated due to the crosstalk in-between.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HEV RNA among US blood donations collected in the Midwest, a region reported to have a higher prevalence of HEV infection, and the Eastern US. Study Design/Methods: 30,695 fresh and 20,029 frozen EDTA plasma samples from American Red Cross donors, collected from February 2015-2016, were de-identified and screened by individual donation testing (ID-NAT) using cobasV R HEV for use on the cobasV R 8800 System under a research protocol. Samples were primarily from Midwestern and Eastern regions of the US. Samples reactive on cobasV R HEV were further tested by an alternate HEV NAT, HEV RNA quantitation, HEV genotyping, and for HEV antibodies. Results/Findings: Of 50,724 valid results, a total of 3 donations were reactive on cobasV R HEV and all were confirmed positive. The confirmed donations were from a 65-year old male in Indiana, a 21-year old male in California, and a 55-year old female in Kentucky. All 3 donations were positive by hemi-nested PCR and alternative HEV NAT; however, only the Kentucky donation had a high level of HEV RNA (1440 IU/mL), and was strongly positive for both IgM and IgG HEV antibodies. The Indiana donation was genotyped as 3a, the California donation genotype 3b, and no genotype determined for the Kentucky donation (see Table) .

Conclusion: Based on the 3 confirmed-positive donations of 50,724 tested, the HEV prevalence was 0.006% (95% exact CI: 0.001% to 0.017%) with a detection rate of 1:16,667 (95% CI, 1:588-1:100,000). To date, no cases of TT-HEV have been documented in the US. However, based on the prevalence observed, immunosuppressed transfusion recipients may be at increased risk for transfusion-transmitted HEV. Background/Case Studies: Monitoring the epidemiology of TTIs within the donor population is critical to provide an ongoing assessment of infection risks associated with FDA policy changes such as the MSM deferral criteria. TTIMS is a multi-center, federally-funded program intended to derive HBV, HCV and HIV prevalence, incidence, viral genotypes, and donor risk factors for greater than 50% of blood collected in the US. TTIMS is supported by two distinct coordinating centers (laboratory and risk factor, LRCC, and donation database, DDCC). Here we report 13 months of prevalence along with demographic trends from the DDCC. Study Design/Methods: Four blood providers and their respective testing laboratories participated. Standardized consensus-positive (CP) monitoring definitions were established for donor test results for HBV, HCV and HIV. These results, along with demographics for each donor and donation status (first-time vs repeat) were assembled into a single data set. Rates of nucleic acid test (NAT) yield (seronegative) and concordant positives (serologic plus NAT positives) were combined to comprise CPs, were computed overall for donors and donations and by demographic, geographic and temporal characteristics. Where appropriate, rates were compared for differences using 95% confidence intervals. This analysis contains data from 9/1/15-9/30/16. Results/Findings: Among 7,578,462 donations reported (16.2% from firsttime and 83.8% from repeat donors), there were respectively 483, 1489 and 194 CP results for HBV, HCV and HIV with corresponding rates of 6.37,19.63 and 2.56 per 100,000 (pht) donations. Prevalence among firsttime donors was, as expected, higher than among donations from repeat donors with ratios of 23:1, 24:1 and 5.4:1 for HBV, HCV and HIV. Rates (pht) among males were higher than among females for all markers (HBV 8.3 vs 4.2; HCV 23.5 vs 15.2; HIV 3.9 vs 1.0). In general, higher rates for all markers were seen among minority donors, those in the 25-39-year age group (also 18-24 year for HIV), and those from the southeast (and south central for HIV and HCV, and southwest for HBV). No trends were noted over time when 3-month periods were compared.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The Procleix V R Babesia assay on the Procleix Panther V R system is a qualitative in vitro nucleic acid test currently under development. The assay, which is based on Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA), detects four clinically relevant Babesia species (B. microti, B. divergens, B. duncani, and B. venatorum) in human whole blood specimens. This test is intended to screen blood donations individually and in pools of up to 16 donations. Whole blood samples are lysed and then pooled on the automated Procleix Xpress V R system prior to testing on the Procleix Panther system. These studies evaluated the preliminary analytical and clinical performance of the Procleix Babesia assay on the Panther system. Study Design/Method: Analytical sensitivity was determined by diluting in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts for the four Babesia species. Fresh B. microti-infected hamster whole blood, cryopreserved B. duncani-infected hamster whole blood and fresh B. divergens-infected human erythrocytes were tested to determine the limit of detection (LOD) of parasites/mL (p/mL) by probit analysis. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined by screening 32,274 unlinked whole blood donations collected from August 25 th 2016 to April 7 th 2017 in the northeastern United States. Initial reactive donations were confirmed by repeat testing, PCR, and/or IgG immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Reactive individual donor lysates were tested in pools of 16. Results/Finding: The Procleix Babesia assay detected all four Babesia species with a 95% LOD ranging from 7.10-13.51 copies/mL. The preliminary 95% LOD in parasites/mL ranged from 0.64-3.61 p/mL for B. microti (n59), from 0.92-1.52 p/mL for B. duncani (n52), and from 0.62-4.95 p/mL for B. divergens (n52). Of the 32,274 donations screened, 17 initial reactive and 14 confirmed positive donations were identified for specificity of 99.991% (95%CI: 99.972-99.997%). Of the confirmed positive specimens, 8 were reactive by both IFA and PCR, 5 by IFA only and 1 by PCR only. All confirmed positive samples were reactive in lysate pools of 16. Donors of reactive donations resided in CT (11), NJ (1), NH (1) and ME (1) for an overall incidence of 1:2,305, and 1:1,433 in CT. Conclusion: The Procleix Babesia assay on the Procleix Panther system demonstrated high clinical specificity and sensitivity and detected all four Babesia species with similar sensitivity. All confirmed positive donations were also detected in pools of 16 thus demonstrating the effectiveness of pooled lysate screening. Conclusion: Use of the LAg avidity assay shows that in both first-time and repeat HIV-positive US blood donors, newly-acquired (i.e., incident) HIV infections are more frequent in younger donors. The use of this approach provides an additional monitoring tool to assess changes in characteristics of donors whose risk exposure was proximate to the date of donation and will also complement traditional incidence methods by allowing derivation of incidence by donor type.",

Incidence was measured as the number of positives among repeat donors divided by the total time at risk, in person-years (PY). RR was calculated using the window periods of 18.5, 7.4 and 9.1 days for HBV, HCV and HIV, respectively. Linear regressions were calculated with p<0.05 (*) as significant. Results/Findings: From 1/1/08-12/31/15, there were more than 48 million donations from 13,204,447 donors (51.4% female, 33% First-Time (FT), 81.4% Caucasian). There were significant decreases in donation prevalence for HBV and HCV (p50.014 and 0.044), but no significant decrease in HIV during the 8 years (see Table for F and R 2 values). A significant decrease was seen in FT donor prevalence for HBV and HCV (p50.026 and 0.042). Prevalent FT donors were significantly more likely to be male (68.3% -HBV, 59.8% -HCV, 79.7% -HIV; p<0.001). Incidence for all agents declined (significant only for HBV; p50.035). The decrease in HCV incidence was not significant, but there were fewer incident donors in the last 2-year period (74 in 2012-2013 vs. 19 in 2014-2015) . HCV incident donors in 2014-2015 were more likely to be male (79.0% vs 46.0% in 2012-2013, p<0.001) and were younger (84.2% vs. 67.6% in 2012-2013 <40 years, p50.011). Overall, incident donors were more likely to be Caucasian males (p<0.01). RRs for all 3 agents decreased over time with RRs in 2014-2015 of 1 in 1,565,000; 1 in 2,680,000; and 1 in 2,435,000 for HBV, HCV and HIV, respectively. Conclusion: Prevalence, incidence and RR of HBV, HCV and HIV have generally decreased within this blood system over the 8-year time frame. As donor screening and deferral regulations evolve, it is important to monitor these risks. It is critical to note that even in a large population, small changes to the number of positives can have a significant impact on prevalence and incidence rates. Furthermore, in 2015, MAYV was isolated from a patient in Haiti, suggesting the virus is already circulating in the Caribbean. The extent of MAYV transmission could be underestimated due to limited surveillance and diagnostic capabilities; therefore, it is necessary to be prepared for MAYV emergence and the potential risk for the blood supply in case it can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Study Design/Method: Platelet components (PC) prepared in PAS were spiked with MAYV and treated with amotosalen and UVA illumination. Samples were collected pre-UVA and post-UVA illumination for infectious titer determination. AS-5 RBCs were spiked with MAYV, mixed with glutathione (GSH)/Processing solution, dosed with 200lM amustaline, and incubated for 18hrs at room temperature. Samples were collected prior to the addition of amustaline (pre-treatment) and following the 3hr incubation (post-treatment) to determine infectious titers.",

Conclusion: This study demonstrates robust inactivation of MAYV by both amotosalen/UVA treatment in PC and amustaline/GSH treatment in RBCs. These systems are efficient at inactivating Alphaviruses that have demonstrated or have the potential for transfusion-transmission, including MAYV, CHIKV and RRV.

Early therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) initiation has improved survival. Absolute immature platelet count (A-IPC) has been found to aid in diagnosis and follow-up of TTP patients. A-IPC changes in response to therapy in patients with low ADAMTS13 activity and high inhibitor have not been analyzed in a patient cohort. We analyzed A-IPC response to therapy in five patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency and high inhibitor at a large tertiary academic medical center. Study Design/Method: Patients had ADAMTS13 activity of <5% and high inhibitor (1.4-8). Mean age of cohort 22.8 years (range 17-64). Four patients were female and one was male. Patients presented with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia (mean 15.2 x 10 9 /L, range 9 -27 x 10 9 /L) and low A-IPC (mean 1.5 x 10 9 /L, range 0.5 -3.6 x 10 9 /L). Patients were initiated on daily TPE and prednisone; additional immunosuppression during hospital stay for cohort consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m 2 (4 patients) and cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m 2 (one patient). TPE continued until platelet count reached 150 x 10 9 /L for at least two consecutive days. Immature platelet fraction (%-IPF) and A-IPC (%-IPF x platelet count) were obtained with daily pre-TPE CBC. A-IPC ratio was calculated from baseline.",

However, this improvement in platelet count was not accompanied by expected decreases in A-IPC, suggestive of recovery from disease. All patients experienced platelet (mean 217.6 x 10 9 /L, range 200 -294 x 10 9 /L) and A-IPC (mean 19.4 x 10 9 /L, range 13 -28.5 x 10 9 /L) decreases that occurred concurrently while receiving daily TPE so that after a mean of 11.6 days (range 8-14 days) mean platelet count was 65.4 x 10 9 /L (range 14 176 x 10 9 /L) and mean A-IPC 3.2 x 10 9 /L (range 0.7 -6.6 x 10 9 /L). Patients were initiated in either rituximab or cyclophosphamide therapy in conjunction with TPE after a mean of 20.8 days of A-IPC and platelet count instability. A-IPC trended to levels indicative of restoration of a negative feedback after this time. Conclusion: Rapid decreases in platelet counts after a good response in TTP patients may raise suspicion for presence of high ADAMTS13 inhibitor. Patients with a high inhibitor have similar A-IPC dynamics during which initial high A-IPC production is followed by unexpected decreases in A-IPC concurrent with platelet counts. Recovery occurs once negative feedback between platelet and A-IPC production is re-established. Patients with a high inhibitor may represent a distinct subset of TTP as suggested by A-IPC responses.",

Kiss 2,3 . 1 Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 2 Blood Systems Inc., 3 University of Pittsburgh Background/Case Studies: Consensus guidelines recommend that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) must be started as early as possible and within 4-8 hours after the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been made; however, there are limited data documenting actual practice. There are several operational facets of delivering a centralized urgent TPE program in a multi-hospital healthcare system, including: central venous (CV) access, ordering, release and delivery of thawed plasma, and transportation of personnel and equipment to perform the procedure. This study analyzes the time elapsed between major steps from diagnosis to initiation of TPE in patients admitted with TTP. Study Design/Method: A retrospective review of the electronic medical record and laboratory information systems from January 1, 2013 to November 1, 2016 was conducted to identify all TTP patients undergoing urgent TPE. Demographics, comorbidities, and other pertinent laboratory tests (such as ADAMTS-13 activity levels, complete blood count, biochemical markers of hemolysis and coagulation studies) were reviewed on all identified patients. Temporal data for TPE request, CV access placement, plasma product release (which usually happens after CV access), arrival of TPE team and initiation of the procedure were extracted from procedure notes and the blood bank information system. Descriptive and summary statistics were generated using Stata version 14 (Statacorp, TX). Group comparisons were made based on hospital location, level of care and history of TTP using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results/Finding: Of the 96 TTP patients identified, 22 were excluded due to missing temporal data for important variables. The majority (85%) of patients were treated at central academic centers, with the remainder being treated at peripheral sites. Fifteen patients (20%) had a prior history of TTP and 26% had severe ADAMTS13 deficiency on admission. The median time from TPE request to initiation was 5.6 hours (interquartile range: 4.7-7.2 hours). There were non-significant trends to shorter time intervals from request to CV access and request to TPE initiation in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) versus non-ICU patients (table 1) . Treatment was not started within an 8-hour window in 13 patients; the median time to CV access was significantly longer in these patients (5.8 vs 2.47 hours, p<0.001). Two of these patients had a prior history of TTP and only four patients had severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency. The majority (more than 70%) of the time interval between TPE request and TPE initiation was spent obtaining CV access and plasma products. There were no significant differences in time intervals comparing patients with a new diagnosis of TTP versus patients with recurrent/ relapsed disease (table 1) or between patients treated at a central academic center versus a peripheral hospital. Conclusion: The consensus 4-8 hour target window from TPE request to initiation appears feasible for a centralized TPE program servicing a multi-48A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 hospital healthcare system. Addressing limitations in availability of CV access would likely yield the greatest improvement in timeliness of urgent TPE.",

Jan C Hofmann* and Dobri D Kiprov. California Pacific Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Several retrospective, case series have suggested that cytoreductive therapy to treat cellular hyperviscosity and prevent thrombotic events in patients (pts) with chronic myelogenous leukemia with accelerated transformation (CML-AT) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) may improve short-term outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy of cytapheresis treatment in this group of pts has been performed. Study Design/Method: From January, 2006 through January, 2017, we performed cytapheresis (Cy) treatments (txs) for 123 pts with either CML-AT or ET, and clinical and/or laboratory evidence of cellular hyperviscosity. 84 pts (68%) had CML-AT and received 319 leukapheresis (Lp) txs; 39 pts (32%) had ET and received 124 thrombocytapheresis (Tc) txs. CML-AT pts presented with median WBC 398 x 10 9 /L (range 193-689 x 10 9 /L), of which 63% had blast percent >75% or blast count >100 x 10 9 /L. Median age was 42 years (8-79 years); 62% were male. CNS symptoms (sxs) of leukostasis (lks) were defined as: headache, cognitive decline, confusion, somnolence, visual abnormalities, or seizure; pulmonary (pulm) sxs of lks were defined as: dyspnea, hypoxia, or bilateral chest infiltrates. 22% of CML-AT pts had no sxs of lks; 40% pts had sxs of either CNS or pulm lks (1 sxs), and 38% pts had sxs of both CNS and pulm lks (2 sxs). ET pts presented with median platelet (plt) count of: 1738 x 10 9 /L (642-3510 x 10 9 /L)and 71% pts had sxs of thrombosis (evidence of CVA or TIA, MI, or DVT). Median age was 66 years (31-89 years); 58% pts were male. Results/Finding: All pts received a course of Cy tx with following objectives: 1) decreasing the risk of thrombotic/ hemorrhagic complications related to hyperviscosity, and 2) stabilizing CML-AT pts for induction chemotherapy (ind chemo). WBC (or plt ct) tx goals were: WBC count (ct) <100 x 10 9 /L for CML-AT pts, and plt ct <450 x 10 9 /L for symptomatic ET pts and <750 x 10 9 /L for asymptomatic ET pts. CML-AT pts received median of 3 Lp txs (mean 3.9 txs/pt; range 2-8 txs). ET pts underwent median of 2 Tc txs (mean 3.4 txs/pt; 1-7 txs). Outcomes were evaluated by percentage of pts who: 1) reached WBC (or plt ct) tx goal, and 2) received ind chemo. \"Improved\" outcome was defined as pts who reached their WBC (or plt ct) tx goal during CY tx; \"stabilized\" were pts who achieved >50% reduction in WBC (or plt ct) without reaching goal; and \"unchanged\" were pts who achieved neither. In CML-AT cohort, 76% pts improved, 21% pts stabilized; and 3% pts worsened. In ET cohort, 85% improved, 14% stabilized, and 1% were unchanged. For CML-AT pts, median final WBC ct 5 96 x 10 9 /L (range 66-307 x 10 9 /L); 94% pts received ind chemo. For ET pts, median final plt ct 5 705 x 10 9 /L (263-1087 x 10 9 /L); 95% pts had resolution of thrombotic 49A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 symptoms. 4% of CML-AT pts and 0% of ET pts expired within 1-4 days after course of CY tx. Of 3 expired pts, 2 pts had both blast crisis and sxs of CNS/ pulm lks; 1 pt had intracranial hemorrhage or CVA; and 2 pts were hypotensive, intubated, or unable to tolerate ind chemo. Conclusion: Pts with CML-AT or ET and evidence of impending thrombosis may benefit from cytoreductive therapy. A limited number of cytapheresis treatments (median 2-3 txs) can enable a high percentage of pts to receive definitive treatment and may improve short-term clinical outcomes. A RCT to assess efficacy of cytapheresis treatment versus induction chemotherapy (or platelet inhibitor tx) alone in this subset of pts would be very useful. Background/Case Studies: Partial normal saline replacement during plasma exchange procedures is common practice. Benefits of using normal saline as a replacement fluid include reduced procedure costs and possible reduction of the hypothetical hyper-oncotic effects of standard albumin formulations. However, the use of normal saline may increase the risk of undesired, and potentially costly, adverse events, such as hypotension and citrate reactions. The goal of this study was to compare the frequency of reported adverse outcomes for patients that received all albumin versus albumin/ saline as replacement fluid for plasma exchange at our institution. Study Design/Method: A four year retrospective chart review was done of all therapeutic apheresis procedures performed by our apheresis service that used 100% albumin or 80% albumin-20% normal saline (80/20) as replacement. Patients who received plasma entirely or partially as replacement were excluded. The procedure type ordered (100% albumin vs 80/20), the percent of normal saline actually used during the procedure, age, gender, and any noted adverse events during the procedure were recorded in all cases. Repeated procedures were modeled using a generalized linear mixed model to examine the risk of having hypotension and/or citrate toxicity where 100% albumin was used versus those that used 80/20. Covariates included were fluid types, age and gender. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as a measure of risk. We used the term significant for a two-sided p-value < 0.05. Results/Finding: During the study period, 3650 procedures were documented for 414 subjects (46% female), age range 0-93 years, of which 2,470 (67.7%) received 80/20. The type of fluid used as replacement had a significant effect on the risk of having either hypotension or citrate toxicity. Replacement with 100% albumin had a significantly lower risk of having either event than by using 80/20, [p50.002, OR (CI): 0.40(0.22, 0.72)] , and also had a significantly lower risk of causing hypotension [p50.023, OR (CI):0.45 (0.22, 0.89)] in addition to a lower risk of causing citrate toxicity [p50.042, OR (CI): 0. 24 (0.06, 0.95)]. Age had a significant effect on having a hypotensive event [p50.04, OR (CI):1.1 (1.0, 1.1)] but no effect on citrate toxicity or the combined outcome. Gender had no effect on frequency of any event.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Partial saline use as a replacement fluid with albumin during plasma exchange significantly increases the risk of hypotension and citrate toxicity during the procedure. Age also increases the risk of hypotension. Use of saline as replacement fluid during plasma exchanges should be minimized to maximize patient safety especially in older patients. Background/Case Studies: Therapeutic apheresis (TA) is a complex procedure that is mostly well-tolerated and rarely associated with adverse events (AEs). There are few studies published on AEs associated with TA but they lack uniformity of data. Moreover, there is no common database in the United States (US) to report TA-associated AEs. We evaluated the annual incidence rates of AEs associated with TA at a large tertiary academic medical center over a 10 year period and compared it to published literature. Study Design/Method: We conducted a 10-year retrospective study of TA procedures performed and AEs were classified according to criteria described in Table 1 . During the study period, TA were performed using COBE Spectra (Software versions 4.7 and 6.1) and since 2013 the Spectra Optia apheresis system (version 8.0). Literature search was conducted for data published on AEs associated with TA. Four studies from US and 13 non-US studies (Canada, Europe and Japan) were analyzed. Trend for AE rates from 2007-16 was also analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square and Spearman rho tests. Results/Finding: The overall AE incidence was 6.9% (396 of 5,684 procedures) during 10 year period. Frequency of AEs associated with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was significantly higher (8.5%, p<0.00001) compared to other TA procedures. We found significant correlation between number of TPE and AEs (Spearman rho 0.7, p50.002) over the 10 years and significant down trend of moderate and severe AEs with a Spearman rho of -0.64 (p50.04) and -0.83 (p50.003) respectively. There were no fatalities during the study period. Majority of AEs were Grade I (60%) and Grade II (28%): 32/5684 (0.6%) procedures were not completed due to AEs. Comparison of AEs [6.9% (396/5,684)] to both European [11.2% (N513, 12, 256/ 109, 842) ] and other US studies [13.6% (N54, 860/6,324)] showed a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Overall incidence of AEs was significantly lower than current published literature. Incidence of AEs published in other countries is significantly lower than rates published in US. Differences in incidence of AEs in literature emphasizes need for uniform reporting and stratification of AEs and development of a common database to report TA-associated AEs. We propose a grading rationale in order to standardize reporting of AE (Table 1) .",

AKH Vienna University Hospital Background/Case Studies: Plateletpheresis is associated with short-term variations in biochemical markers of bone turnover. Socio-demographic factors and lifestyle behaviors are recognized factors which influence mineral metabolism and bone health. In the present study we analyzed the influence of demographic and lifestyle factors on the observed changes in bone markers in a large cohort of routine platelet donors. Study Design/Method: Altogether 200 platelet donors with a donation activity of up to 150 platelet donations participated in the study. After a detailed anamnesis all participants underwent a standardized questioner asking for several lifestyle factors known to affect bone metabolism. Blood was sampled before and after plateletpheresis and was analyzed for the bone formation marker osteocalcin (OC) and the bone resorption marker cross-linked telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX), among other parameters. The effect of calcium supplementation on bone metabolism was tested in a placebocontrolled crossover study involving ten donors. Results/Finding: Plateletpheresis resulted in an increase in the serum levels of the bone resorption marker CTX and the bone formation marker OC. Both parameters returned to base levels within 2 hours after the end of the collection. Multiple regression analysis including the parameters sex, age , positive family history of bone disease, but also individual factors like hormonal contraception, smoking, regular alcohol consumption or sportive activity revealed no influence of socio-demographic or lifestyle factors on the observed variation in CTX or OC. There was no association between individual donor career or the number of previous donation and the observed increase in bone turnover. The only predictive parameter we could identify was the amount of citrate exposure during plateletpheresis. Increase in serum CTX, showed an inverse correlation to changes of serum ionized calcium. Continuous IV supplementation of calcium-gluconate throughout plateletpheresis reduced the variations in bone markers, although this effect was more pronounced for CTX compared to OC. Conclusion: The amount of citrate infused during routine plateletpheresis is a predictive parameter for the transient increase in serum markers of bone metabolism. Known risk factors for bone diseases, including sex, age, smoking or alcohol consumption, seems to have a low impact on the observed citrate-related variations in serological biomarkers of bone turnover.",

We hypothesized that removing these bioactive substances improves host immune response and reduces organ dysfunction. Study Design/Methods: Blood products were prepared from syngeneic rat blood according to blood bank standards. Soluble mediators were removed from red blood cells (14 days old) and platelets (5 days old) by washing. Plasma was filtered through a 0.22um filter. Rats ($350 grams) were poly-traumatized by crush injury to the small intestines, the liver lobes, and by fracture of the right femur and hemorrhaged $30% of their estimated blood volume, which was calculated to be 57mL/kg. Hemorrhage continued until a mean arterial pressure of 40mmHg was reached. Rats were randomized to resuscitation with standard blood products, washed/filtered blood products or sham. Blood samples were taken up to 4h after trauma to assess biochemistry and coagulation status. Ex vivo whole blood stimulation tests with LPS were performed after sacrifice, and organ damage was assessed by histopathology. Blood products were sampled to assess for biochemical changes. Comparisons between groups was done by ANOVA and Dunnett's post-test for multiple comparisons. Results/Findings: Filtering or washing of blood products significantly stabilized pH, sodium and potassium concentrations and decreased lactate levels in the products compared to standard products. Both resuscitation groups received an average of 17mL/kg of blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio. However, use of washed/filtered products did not improve organ failure, as assessed by histopathologic score and levels of creatinine, ASAT and ALAT. The coagulation status as assessed by thromboelastometry was deranged in all groups and normalized during transfusion, showing no significant differences between washed/filtered products and standard care. Immune response to LPS was decreased following trauma compared to healthy controls but did not differ between groups. Conclusion: Filtering or washing of blood products reduces some aspects of storage lesion of blood products, without affecting the hemostatic capacity of the products, but does not improve organ injury in a rat trauma and transfusion model, nor does it improve the immunosuppressive host response. These results suggest that washing or filtering of blood products may have no relevant clinical effects in a rat polytrauma model.",

However, there is concern about the risk of thromboembolic events and adverse neurological effects such as seizures, which might worsen patient outcomes. Consequently, we stopped using TXA in April 2013, which enabled us to conduct a before-and-after study. The present study aimed to examine the association between TXA and adverse effects (seizures, thromboembolism, and renal dysfunction) in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery using a propensity score matching model. We also assessed the association between TXA and other clinical outcomes (reoperation for bleeding, transfusion volume, blood loss, ventilation time, intensive care unit stay, and 30-day mortality). Study Design/Method: This single center retrospective cohort study involved patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or offpump coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2008 and July 2015 (n53535). Because of missing data on patient characteristics, 257 patients were excluded. The incidence of adverse effects associated with TXA and other clinical outcomes were evaluated before (January 2008 to March 2013, n51987) and after (April 2013 to July 2015, n51291) using a propensity score model. We estimated propensity scores using a logistic regression model for TXA use as a function of 18 baseline variable, generating 969 pairs of patients who received or did not receive TXA. We also evaluated the adverse effects of TXA using segmental regression analysis. Results/Finding: Propensity-matched analysis showed that seizures were more common (8.7% vs 3.7%, p<0.001) and ventilation time was longer (15 h vs 13 h, p50.04) significantly in the TXA group than in the non-TXA group. In contrast, transfusion volume and blood loss were significantly lower in the TXA group than in the non-TXA group (2000 ml vs 2200 ml, p50.009; and 1265 ml vs 1460 ml, p<0.001, respectively). However, 30-day mortality was not statistically different between the groups (1.6% vs 1.4%, p50.82). None of the other outcomes were significantly different. Segmental regression analysis yielded similar results. Conclusion: Even though TXA may be associated with an increased rate of seizures and longer ventilator time, it does not increase mortality. The use of TXA is significantly associated with decreased blood loss and transfusion volume, providing social benefit by reducing the need for blood transfusion because the supply of blood components will be limited with the aging of Japanese society. It seems to be advantageous to use TXA because decreased blood loss and transfusion volume and the associated social benefit outweigh the disadvantages of an increased rate of seizures and longer ventilator time.",

Per current AABB Standards, this necessitates a new sample every 3 days. This can lead to excessive iatrogenic blood loss and increasing difficulty with obtaining intravenous access in the patient, to the point that an invasive catheter such as a PICC line may be placed. In order to mitigate these issues, we chose to extend the type and screen specimen to expire after 7 days in patients without RBC alloantibodies other than passively acquired anti-D due to Rh immune globulin administration. Study Design/Method: Patients expected to have an antenatal hospitalization of at least 4 days with high risk for transfusion need are identified by the obstetrical service, which submits a request to the transfusion service for extension of pre-transfusion specimens to 7 days. The transfusion service medical director reviews the case and gives final approval. We observed Only 1 patient did not have an in-date specimen when the extended out-dating was requested.

In AI, inflammation-induced hepcidin decreases iron availability, a process that is thought to be regulated by erythroferrone, which impact erythropoiesis. Knowledge on changes in iron metabolism during the course of AI is limited, hampering the development of strategies to counteract AI. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of parameters of iron metabolism during the development of AI in critically ill patients.",

Patients were matched on age and sex. A linear mixed model was used to assess differences in parameters of iron metabolism between groups and over time. Results/Findings: In patients with AI, levels of iron, transferrin and transferrin saturation decreased already prior to the development of anemia, with lower levels compared to controls (table) . Ferritin and hepcidin were increased in AI compared to controls. In the course of AI development, erythroferrone decreased. Differences in iron metabolism between groups were not influenced by disease severity. Patients with AI differed from patients with anemia due to acute blood loss, the latter was characterized by high iron (15.4 vs. 2.9 mmol/L, p<0.001) and transferrin saturation (53 vs. 9 %, p<0.001), and low ferritin (104 vs. 645 mg/L, p<0.001). Conclusion: In critically ill patients with AI, iron metabolism is already altered prior to the development of anemia, suggesting a potential window of opportunity for therapy. Iron metabolism in AI is more disturbed than in non-anemic septic controls, irrespective of disease severity, indicating that AI is not solely determined by severity of inflammation. Iron metabolism in AI patients differs from patients with acute blood loss, suggesting that efforts to modulate iron metabolism in anemic ICU patients should take the cause of anemia into account.",

Study Design/Methods: We have developed a solution consisting of a defined concentration of reagents routinely used in blood therapy. On combination with blood, this solution results in the selective sedimentation of erythrocytes by gravity within 30 minutes. The WCF remains in solution and can be easily separated from the erythrocyte sediment. The WCF can then be concentrated by gentle centrifugation into a small volume containing less than 1% of the original erythrocyte content. The addition of DMSO for cryogenic storage and controlled freezing using standard procedures then completes this simple process. Results/Findings: We have clearly demonstrated that this method allows almost the entire WCF to be isolated and/or concentrated with only modest loss of any of the cellular sub-sets thus far examined. In addition to improving pre-freeze yields, post-thaw recoveries of viable cells are markedly increased, with a yield of approximately 65% of the CD341 fraction post separation and freeze thaw (Table 1) . Possibly more important, the CFU assay results reproducibly yield higher counts of CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM and BFU colonies (Table  1) which is a strong indicator that this method will improve patient outcomes.

In addition to a CD341 cell target of 4.0x10 6 /Kg, a lymph target was also implemented. Fifty patients before (No ALC) and after (ALC) implementation were retrospectively evaluated. Study Design/Method: Lymph and CD341 yields, number of collections, lymph target reached, and days to engraftment were examined. Mobilization was G-CSF (G) or G-CSF 1 plerixafor (G1Pl). Consecutive No ALC and ALC procedures were examined. The Mann-Whitney and Chi Square tests were used for statistical comparison, p< 0.05 considered significant. Results/Finding: 110 No ALC and 159 ALC collections occurred among the 50 patients. Fenwal Amicus was used for 91% of the No ALC and 99% of the ALC collections (TerumoBCT Spectra Optia CMNC used for remaining).

Current NET-Cord-FACT standards specify that units can be stored for almost 48 hours at room temperature (RT) as long as units are cryopreserved by 48-hours post-collection. The impact of such delay on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function is unclear since most studies have not used transplantation assays that measure HSC key properties and activities. We hypothesized that such processing delay reduces the engraftment activities of UCB units. We set out to measure the loss in engraftment activities associated with preprocessing storage. Study Design/Method: UCB units (n53) were split with one half processed immediately (baseline 8-12 hours) and the second after 43 hours storage at RT. UCB were then processed with hetastarch and buffy coat maintained cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until use. Viability was assessed post-thaw, and thawed UCB buffy coat cells were transplanted into NSG mice. Serial transplantation was used to test the self-renewal and differentiation activities of HSC, while limiting dilution (LD) assay and Poisson statistic were used to estimate the frequency of Scid repopulating cells (SRC) in thawed units. Results/Finding: Storage before processing had no significant impact on the recovery of viable post-thaw CD451 cells and CD341 cell (n53). Primary NSG mice were transplanted with a UCB cell dose that contained a total of 7,500 annexinV NEG viable CD341 cells. The latter was done to avoid any bias towards one group or another. Short term platelets (190 vs. 140 hPlt/mL, p50.06) and leucocytes (1.2% vs. 0.2% hCD451, p<0.02) engraftment at 4-weeks were significantly reduced in stored mice vs. baseline (n53), and similar results were observed long-term at 16-weeks. Long-term human bone marrow (BM) engraftment was also reduced in primary transplants from stored samples ( myeloid engraftment was however confirmed in both groups. BM cells from primary mice were transplanted into secondary recipients and human engraftment investigated 3 months post-transplant. Strikingly, the frequency of human CD451 BM cells was 10-fold greater in baseline vs. stored mice (p<0.01, n52). Hence, storage at RT of UCB units is associated with a deficit in engraftment activity likely due to a loss in HSC activity and/or numbers. To distinct between both possibilities, the net number of SRC in baseline and stored samples for two units were calculated by LD transplantation assay. The net number of SRC measured 22-weeks post-transplants were reduced by 30% in unit 1, and by 80% in unit 2. Conclusion: Prolonged preprocessing RT storage significantly impairs the engraftment activities of UCB units. The reduced engraftment in secondary transplants coupled with the results from the LD assays suggest that this engraftment deficit origins from loss of HSC numbers. Our results stress the importance of rapid UCB processing to avoid loss of engraftment activity.",

Draper Background/Case Studies: New cell therapies require efficient and automated methods for purification of target cells prior to subsequent processing. While apheresis, density gradient centrifugation, and magnetic separation achieve some of the requirements, no method is currently available that fully meets clinical needs for a closed, automated, and scalable process. Continuous acoustic separation in microchannels is emerging as a versatile method for sorting, separating, and concentrating cells from blood. It has advantages over centrifugation because it is scalable to small or large quantities and can discriminate cells by size as well as density. Meanwhile, unlike magnetic methods, acoustophoresis is \"label free\" and adds no reagents to the therapeutic cells. It has been shown previously that acoustic separation can separate blood components including purification of lymphocytes. However, these studies used devices that were constructed from silicon or glass and have limited potential for scale-up or production as disposable cartridges. In contrast, we report the first ever demonstration of acoustic lymphocyte enrichment along with RBC and platelet depletion in a disposable plastic chip, and we present a cartridge concept that enables clinical scale throughput by linking microchannels in parallel. Study Design/Method: Acoustophoresis uses ultrasonic waves to oscillate a rectangular microchannel having a cross section on the scale of the ultrasonic wavelength ($1mm). This results in an acoustic force across the channel that drives cells toward the axial center stream. Because the force increases with a cell's size and density, lymphocytes experience a weaker force than RBCs and other classes of WBCs. Thus, as blood product flows through the device, the lymphocyte population is enriched at the sides of the channel and can be captured in a branching outlet. Likewise, platelets can by separated from lymphocytes. Initial and output cell counts are measured by a standard hematology analyzer. Results/Finding: In our acoustic system, lymphocyte purity (% of total WBCs) was enriched up to 97%, using leukapheresis product as the starting material. This enrichment was achieved in a single pass through the device (residence time of 1sec). Total lymphocyte recovery was 43% and monocyte concentration was reduced 76%. Furthermore, in a two-pass process platelets were reduced by 75%. In a 12-fold parallel system we tested RBC separation from plasma and achieved 90% separation at 72ml/hr. Conclusion: Acoustic lymphocyte enrichment along with platelet depletion from standard blood product was demonstrated for the first time in plastic microchannels. Such disposable devices are suitable for scale up to clinical bioprocessing systems. Lymphocyte purity is comparable to existing methods with the advantage of monocyte and platelet depletion and potential for an automated instrument. ",

Bynum 2 and Andrew P Cap 2 . 1 US Army Institute of Surgical Research, 2 U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Background/Case Studies: Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) have been investigated for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), graft versus host disease (GVHD), wound healing and trauma. A consensus is building that the immunomodulation by MSCs is key to their therapeutic potential. MSCs suppress peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation in vitro, suggesting a correlation for suppressing PBMC inflammatory responses in vivo. Current mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays generally rely on either direct co-culture or indirect culture using transwell systems for monitoring the proliferation of isolated PBMCs in the presence of mitotically inactive MSCs. In the study detailed here, MSCs are analyzed in a direct co-culture with PBMCs using a luminescent ATP assay. Study Design/Method: Blood was obtained from an in house blood bank and PBMCs were separated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque in Leuco-Sep tubes as specified by the manufacturer. The pooled donor PBMCs were stored at -80. MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord (BM-MSC, Ad-MSC, UC-MSC, respectively) or human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) were serially diluted starting at 50-60,000 cells/ well and cultured in 96 well plates for 4-48 h in their respective medias. On Day 0, MSCs were washed, resuspended in PBMC media and incubated with or without 150,000 freshly thawed PBMCs/well, in the presence or absence of phytohemagglutinin A (PHA, 0-5 lg/ml). Proliferation of both MSCs and PBMCs was assessed in triplicate wells by quantitation of ATP levels using the bioluminescent reagent Cell Titer-Glo (Promega). Results/Finding: PBMC proliferation in response to PHA gave a robust ATP signal by 72 h, with >6 fold increase over control PBMCs. No increase in ATP response or proliferation was seen in the absence of PHA. Co-culture with MSCs inhibited PBMC proliferation dependent upon MSC passage, source, MSC media additive. Intra-assay variance of triplicate samples was 10.0%. Inter-assay variation of MSC preps run under identical conditions was 7.5%. Inhibition of PBMC proliferation was graded from 0-100% over the range MSC concentrations therefore an EC50 of MSC cell number resulting in 50% suppression of PBMC could be determined for each MSC prep. This EC50 however was dependent upon PBMC donor pool. Conclusion: Direct co-culture of live MSCs with freshly thawed PBMCs give a robust determination of immunosuppression by MSCs. Graded responses can be determined, allowing comparison of potency between MSC preparations. This streamlined assay can be performed within 72 h, without irradiating cells and with minimal equipment outlay.",

Differences between donors 16-18 years old (yo) and adults in baseline and donation-altered iron status are important to understand because teenagers need increased iron for physiological growth and development and may be more susceptible to harm from iron depletion. Study Design/Method: Donors aged 16-49 were eligible for ferritin testing if they donated at a high school (HS) blood drive at the start of the 2015/16 academic year at two blood centers. Samples from return donations over the remainder of the school year were also tested. The prevalence of Absent Iron Stores (AIS, ferritin <12 ng/ml) and Low Ferritin (LF, ferritin <26 ng/ml) were estimated for 16, 17, 18 and 19-49yo groups separately for both genders. Linkage to operational databases established first-time (FT) vs repeat (RPT) donor status. Linear regression analysis tested for differences in natural log of enrollment ferritin values by age. Multiple logistic regression assessed whether young age independently predicts iron depletion controlling for donation frequency and other factors. Results/Finding: A total of 4265 donors contributed 6219 donations. Donors were evenly split by gender, 66% were FT donors, and 87% were 16-18yo. FT and RPT 16-18yo donors had on average lower ferritin values at enrollment (p<.0001), and a greater percentage were iron-depleted than donors 19-49yo (Table) . In repeated measures logistic regression analysis using data from all visits, female sex, greater number of previous donations, shorter interval since last donation, and lower body weight were risk factors for both AIS and LF. Controlling for these covariates, donors aged 16-18 have sharply higher risk for iron depletion than donors 19-49yo. Odds for LF were 4 to 6 times greater in the younger donors, and for AIS were 3-to 4fold higher. Preliminary statistical models indicate 16yo donors may have greater risk for LF than 17 or 18yo by 4 to 5 percentage points, controlling for other factors (p5.06). Conclusion: The prevalence of iron depletion varies markedly by age, sex, and donation frequency, but was considerably higher in 16-18yo donors than in adult controls. Logistic regression analysis confirms lower age as an independent risk factor for iron depletion. Blood centers should implement measures to mitigate higher risk for iron depletion and the potential adverse consequences for this population of vulnerable donors.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Iron deficiency is observed in blood donors who meet regulatory hemoglobin (Hb) requirements for blood donation. Frequent donations result in negative iron balance and eventually lead to anemia. Young donors may be at risk for adverse health consequences (cognitive dysfunction, pregnancy-related complications, fatigue, decreased exercise endurance and pica) even before anemia occurs. Study Design/Method: Serum ferritin testing was implemented on 12/19/ 2016 by a large blood collector. Testing was performed on successful 16-18 y/o whole blood and apheresis donations. Low ferritin (LF) was defined as a value < 20 ng/mL in females (F) and < 30 ng/mL in males (M). Donors with low ferritin were notified of deferral from red blood cell (RBC) donations (12 months for F and 6 months for M) and counseled to take 18-28 mg of elemental iron daily for 60 days. For M and F, a ferritin < 12 ng/mL indicated absent iron stores (AIS) and < 26 ng/mL indicated iron deficient erythropoiesis (IDE). Ferritin levels ! 20 ng/mL in F and ! 30 ng/mL in M were considered as indicating an iron-replete state. Conclusion: Ferritin testing of young donors identified individuals with LF who would benefit from risk mitigation, e.g., delaying subsequent RBC donations and/or taking iron supplements. LF is more common in F than in M donors. LF is more prevalent in M and F donors with any RBC donations in the prior 24 months. An appreciable number of donors with no RBC donations in the prior 24 months presented with LF. These data may be useful in conducting a riskbased decision making exercise to establish recommendations for risk mitigation which could be different for M than for F, e.g., universal iron replacement in teen male donors may not be warranted above a certain Hb value.",

ABSTRACT completely investigated. The adolescent growth spurt, poor nutrition and onset of menses increase the risks of iron depletion in young donors. 1 New studies show that teenage donors who give blood frequently may be more susceptible to becoming iron deficient than older repeat donors. 2 Study Design/Methods: Over 28,000 serum samples from donors aged 16, 17 and 18 years were analyzed for ferritin levels using the Beckman Coulter AU680 instrument and reagent kit. The anti-ferritin reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles, of uniform size, coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-ferritin antibody. Immune complexes formed in solution scatter light in proportion to their size, shape and concentration. The decrease in light intensity is measured spectrophotometrically. 3 Results/Findings: Background/Case Studies: The risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in adults can often be identified during adolescent years. The presence of even borderline levels of multiple risk factors increases the likelihood of a CV event. Our blood program routinely provides a total non-fasting cholesterol (TC) and blood pressure (BP) measurement for all blood donors. We added glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) determination and performed analyses of the prevalence of abnormal (borderline or elevated) levels of multiple risk factors among 21,007 adolescents (ages 16-19; 61.5% female) who donated blood from 2015 to 2016. Study Design/Method: Abnormal risk factor levels were defined as HbA1c ! 5.7%, SBP/DBP ! 120/80 mm Hg and TC !170mg/dL, as suggested by the American Heart Association for adolescents. The presence of isolated risk factors was defined as one single abnormal risk factor per individual. Clustering of risk factors was defined as the presence of 2 or more abnormal risk factors in the same individual. Donor sex was recorded at the time of donation. Results/Finding: Table 1 shows the prevalence of isolated abnormal risk factors and the prevalence of abnormal risk factor clustering in the study cohort. Overall, 11,283 (53.7%) adolescents had at least one abnormal risk factor (61.8% of males, 48.6% of females). Of these, 8,709 adolescents had isolated abnormal risk factors, and 2,574 adolescents had clustering risk factors. Higher proportions of males were in the abnormal BP alone, Background/Case Studies: Pre-donation determination of hemoglobin (Hb) level in candidate blood donors is a pre-requisite in the majority of blood services and is used to ensure donor safety and blood product quality. However, a variety of Hb testing strategies are used across blood services to satisfy this selection criterion. This study aimed to identify how Hb screening practices vary across blood donation services and to what extent they influence deferral rates for low Hb. Study Design/Method: An online survey was performed among members of the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative. Additionally, data from literature were used to extend the dataset. The survey involved a detailed assessment of Hb screening practices, numbers of donations and low Hb deferrals for male and female donors separately. Multivariable negative-binomial regression models were built to estimate the adjusted effects of minimum donation intervals, Hb cutoffs (high/low with high defined as !13.5 g/dL for men and !12.5 g/dL for women), iron monitoring (Y/N), iron supplements (Y/N providing or prescribing), and geographical location on deferral rates due to low Hb. Results/Finding: Data were included from 52 blood services worldwide and complete data were available for 25 blood services. Deferral percentages for low Hb varied from 0.01% to 8.81% among male donors and 0.03% to 46.73% among female donors. Hb deferral rates were notably higher in Asian blood services. Overall, iron monitoring was associated with 53% lower Hb deferral rates in men (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 11% to 75%) and 61% lower rates in women (95%CI 15% to 82%). Iron supplementation was associated to 57% lower Hb deferral rates among women (95%CI 22% to 76%) but there was no evidence of such an effect among men (p50.680). Each one-week increase in minimum donation intervals resulted in 8% lower Hb deferral rates among women (95%CI 1% to 14%) but not among men (p50.454). At the 5% level of significance, higher Hb cutoffs do not appear to have an effect among men or women. Conclusion: The variation in Hb deferral rates across blood donation services can be, particularly in female donors, explained by differences in Hb screening and deferral practices. Mitigation strategies should consider the variable response among men and women. These insights can help improve both blood service efficiency and donor care. were: characteristics of donors (age, sex, size, weight, region); Hb levels, date and volume of donation for index application and previous donation; and number of previous donations (in the 5 previous years and the lifetime). Data were analyzed using logistic regression stratified by sex. Results/Finding: 9.15% of all candidates for WB donation were deferred in continental France in 2015. Deferral was significantly more frequent in women (11.16%) than in men (7.29%), due to anemia in 24.41% of deferred women and 9.79% of deferred men. Plotting mean Hb recovery against time showed mean recovery times ranging from 20 to 30 weeks. Analysis (Table) identified 3 main factors associated with a higher likelihood of Hb recovery: higher logarithm of time since previous donation, lower levels of Hb at previous donation, higher number of blood donations in the 5 previous years. Conclusion: The 3 main factors associated with higher likelihood of Hb recovery after WB donation are probably linked with hematopoiesis stimulation and selection bias among high-frequency donors. Mean times required for Hb recovery were long enough to require further studies to assess interdonation intervals in France. Background/Case Studies: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been related to thrombo-embolic events. Microvesicles in the RBC product may support coagulation, which in part may depend on storage time because microvesicles have procoagulant effects in vitro and the amount of microvesicles increase with storage duration. Study Design/Method: We investigated whether transfusion of RBCs containing microvesicles promotes coagulation in human recipients. As transfusion is mostly administered to ill patients, we used a model of mild endotoxemia. Eighteen healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either saline, 2 days stored or 35 days stored autologous RBC transfusion two hours after infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from E.coli, 2 ng/kg). Blood was sampled every 2 hours up to 8 hours after LPS infusion. Results/Finding: LPS resulted in a mild increase in thrombin generation. During storage, the total number of microvesicles increased from 1.4e108 (IQR 8.3e107-1.9e108) /ml in the fresh product to 1.7e110 (IQR 7.9e109-2.3e110/ml; p<0.01) in the stored product (p <0.001), which were mostly RBC derived vesicles. After transfusion, microvesicles from stored RBC products, but not from fresh products, could be detected in the circulation of healthy volunteers and were cleared within 6 hours. However, infusion of stored RBC microvesicles did not augment thrombin generation. Levels of D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex were also unaffected. Conclusion: Transfusion of autologous RBCs containing high levels of microvesicles does not enhance coagulation in human volunteers with mild endotoxemia. Background/Case Studies: Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is characterized by hydrostatic pulmonary edema related to blood transfusion. We sought to examine contemporary risk factors and outcomes for TACO during a period where patient blood manaement has led to declines in blood utilization. Study Design/Methods: At four academic hospitals, cases of TACO were detected by active surveillance of all adult hospitalized patients who received a blood transfusion, and transfused controls were matched to cases by transfusion intensity. TACO incidence was calculated, and clinical characteristics were compared with control patients. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. Hospital mortality and length of stay were modeled using cumulative incidence functions in proportional hazards regression. Results/Findings: 200 cases of TACO and 405 matched controls were enrolled from 20,845 transfused patients who received 128,263 blood components from May 2015 until July 2016. TACO incidence was 1 case per 100 patients transfused. In addition to well described cardiac and renal comorbidities, multivariable analysis identified the following independent predictors of TACO: number of plasma units, emergency surgery, pre-transfusion diuretic use, and higher post-transfusion hemoglobin levels (See Table) . Compared to controls, TACO cases were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (71% vs. 49%; p < 0.001), experienced longer intensive care (4 vs. 3 days; p50.04) and hospital length of stay following transfusion (10 vs. 7 days; p< 0.001), and had higher mortality (21% vs. 11%; p50.02). Conclusion: The incidence of TACO was lower than what has been reported by prior active surveillance studies. Despite declines in its incidence and the number of blood components transfused per case, TACO remains a complication of transfusion with significant associated morbidity and mortality. In addition to risk factors for cardiovascular and kidney disease, plasma transfusion and higher post-transfusion hemoglobin levels were associated with TACO after controlling for other covariates in the model. Additional research is needed to examine the utility of these risk factors in the development of real-time predictive algorithms and the benefit of reduced erythrocyte or plasma exposure in patients at high risk for TACO. Background/Case Studies: The residual risk of bacterial contamination of single-donor apheresis platelets (AP) was recently addressed by the March 2016 FDA draft guidance to enhance the safety of platelet transfusion. This document also describes an existing pathway for AP outdate extension from 5 to 7 days using an FDA cleared rapid test (RT). Our hospital based transfusion service has used this RT to enhance the safety of AP transfusion since July 2008 and to routinely extend AP outdate to day 7 since February 2016. This study reports a 103 month experience of secondary screening of AP using a RT. Study Design/Methods: All AP were obtained from our hospital-based donor center or one of four external suppliers. AP were screened by culture based methods post-collection and prior to entry into our inventory. From July 2008-January 2016, AP underwent RT on day 4. Day 6 and 7 units were transfused with physician approval when deemed medically necessary. Any units remaining in inventory on Day 8 had a second RT performed. From February 2016-January 2017, AP underwent RT on day 5 with routine outdate extension to 7 days by performing a second RT on day 6 and a third RT on day 7, as per manufacturer instructions. Any positive RTs were repeated in triplicate. Repeat RT positive units were quarantined and cultured to identify true positives. False positives (FP) were defined as repeat RT negative (type 1) or repeat RT positive with negative confirmatory culture (type 2). All RT results were reviewed during both study periods. AP transfusion and outdate rates were also summarized. Results/Findings: Since July 2008, 20,010 AP were entered into inventory. Of these, 11,840 (59%) were transfused prior to RT testing. The remaining 8170 (41%) underwent RT on day 4 or day 5. Of these 43 (0.5%) were RT positive (29 type 1 FP, returned to inventory; 14 type 2 FP, discarded), leaving a total available inventory of 8156 units tested by RT. Of these, 5631 (28% of original inventory) were transfused before the end of day 5 and the remaining 2525 (13% of original inventory) reached a day 5 outdate. A total of 1561 (8% of original inventory) were transfused on day 6 or day 7. Of these, 768 underwent a second RT on day 6 (2 RT positives; 1 FP type one and 1 FP type 2) and 233 underwent a third RT on day 7 (no positive results). A total of 964 (5% of original inventory) outdated on day 7. Of these, 754 underwent a second RT on day 8 (no positive results). Conclusion: To date we have performed 9925 RTs on AP at our hospital. No true positives have been identified. Use of RT over the study period decreased our outdate rate from a predicted 13% to only 5%. A total of 1522 AP have been tested twice by RT (768 on day 5 and 6; 754 on day 4 and 8) with 2 (0.1%) positive results, both of which were deemed FP by repeat testing or culture. A total of 233 units have been tested 3 times (day 5, day 6 and day 7) with no additional positives identified. We have not yet identified any units with an initial negative RT result that subsequently converted to a true positive. There is a low FP rate which should also be expected when performing repeat testing on the same unit. These data suggest that the yield for repeating the RT every 24 hours, as currently specified by the manufacturer instructions, is quite low. Additional studies are needed to clarify how RT can optimally be used to enhance detection of AP bacterial contamination.",

            "text": "Survival of Trypanosoma Cruzi in Human Blood Components Laura Tonnetti*, Aaron Thorp and Susan L Stramer. American Red Cross Background/Case Studies: Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is associated with 8 to 10 million infections worldwide, mostly in Latin America. Despite the extensive immigration from endemic areas, only 5 cases of transfusion-transmission (TT) T. cruzi have been reported in the US, before blood donor screening was implemented in 2007. Contributing factors to the low number of TT cases are a possible association between parasite lineage and TT, and high numbers of unreported cases. Platelets are almost exclusively involved in T. cruzi TT cases; however, during preparation of components a large fraction of the parasites can be found in red blood cells (RBCs). We investigated if blood component preparation and storage time affect the survival of the parasite and thus play a role in TT of T. cruzi. Study Design/Method: Whole blood (WB) units were spiked with T. cruzi trypomastigotes to a final concentration between 10-10,000 parasites/mL. Each parasite concentration in WB was tested x2. An aliquot of contaminated WB was used to prepare hemocultures to detect live parasites before preparation of components. RBCs were separated and half of the components leukoreduced (LR) by filtration. Platelets and plasma were separated, along with one aliquot of plasma collected before LR. RBCs were stored at 48C for up to 42 days; platelets were stored at 228C (RT) under agitation for 5 days and plasma was frozen at -208C. Aliquots for culture were removed weekly from RBCs, daily from platelets and after 30 days from frozen plasma. All samples were cultured in Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) media at 278C for detection of live parasites for up to 16 weeks. Results/Finding: Hemocultures from spiked-WB were positive at all concentration of parasites. LR'd and non-LR'd RBCs cultured before storage were positive at all concentrations. After storage at 48C, RBCs from all units spiked with 10,000 parasites/mL were positive for up to 21 days; all further times yielded negative results. At lower concentrations, only non-LR'd RBCs spiked with 1000 parasites/mL were positive for up to 7 days. Plasma samples cultured before freezing were positive at the highest concentration in one non-LR'd sample, while all others were negative. Platelets obtained from WB spiked with 10,000 and 1000 parasites/mL were positive up to 5 days at RT. No parasites were observed in plasma or platelets prior to storage at lower concentrations. Molecular analysis to determine the presence of parasite DNA in each component is on-going. Conclusion: Platelet storage conditions offer a suitable environment for T. cruzi survival; however, high concentrations of parasites also survived in RBCs at 48C for up to 3 weeks. Leukoreduction offers partial protection, while freezing conditions appears unsuitable for T. cruzi survival.",

            "text": "Hemovigilance Monitoring of Platelet Septic Transfusion Reactions (STR) after Treatment with INTERCEPT TM Pathogen Reduction or Large Volume, Delayed Bact/ALERT TM Bacterial Culture Screening Richard Benjamin* 1 , Marion Lanteri 2 and Larry Corash 1 . 1 Cerus Corporation, 2 Scientific Affairs Department, Cerus Corporation Background/Case Studies: Amotosalen/ultraviolet A (UVA) light (INTER-CEPT TM Blood System, Cerus Corporation) pathogen reduction (PR) and delayed, large volume, bacterial culture with the BacT/ALERT TM System (DLVBC) (BioMerieux, Inc) represent respective best-in-class systems to reduce the risk of STR associated with platelet concentrates (PC). Where implemented, hemoviligance (HV) programs continue to receive reports of suspected STR, most of which have low imputability as other causes are more likely or insufficient information is available to impute system failure. Study Design/Methods: United Kingdom (2006 -2015 ), French (2006 -2015 , Swiss (2011 -2015 ), and Belgium(2009 -2015 HV reports, and Cerus Corporation's adverse event records were reviewed to assess the residual risk and imputability of STR with amotosalen/UVA-treated or DLVBC-screened PC. Results/Findings: Approximately 1.35 million DLVBC-screened were issued with a 7 day outdate after release into inventory 3 days after collection, and $2.3 million amotosalen/UVA-treated PC were released into inventory on day 1 or 2, with a 5 to 7 day shelf-life. No septic fatalities were reported with either technology. The French, Belgium and Swiss HV programs monitored >2.83 million conventional, non-DLVBC-screened PC and recorded 58 STR and 9 fatalities. Concurrently, zero definite and 2 possible STR were reported with 607,871 amotosalen/UVA-treated PC, significantly fewer than with conventional PC (Table 1 ) (20.5 STR per million vs. 0.0 per million, P<0.001). One definite, 1 possible, 7 undetermined/indeterminate non-fatal STR and 5 contaminated \"near miss\" PC were reported with 1.35 million DLVBC-screened PC between 2010 and 2015, for a reduced falsenegative rate compared with the prior five years (3.7 STR per million vs. 16.3 per million, P <0.05). HV programs highlight a major weakness when reporting STR. Stringent criteria are used to determine definite imputability, including evidence of patient infection, PC contamination and irrefutable evidence of a donor source, with confirmation of strain identity. Reports with incomplete investigations are considered undetermined or indeterminate, or possible sepsis. Some of these cases are almost certainly due to bacterial contamination of PC, suggesting that the actual rates of sepsis are considerably higher than that reported by HV programs. Conclusion: Best-in-class pathogen reduction and bacterial culture systems reduce STR risk, although underreporting and inadequate clinical data may result in underestimation of the true rates. Pathogen reduction of Background/Case Studies: Despite extant mitigation measures (e.g. diversion pouches and primary platelet culture at the collection facility), bacterial contamination of platelets and associated septic transfusion reactions remains a leading cause of transfusion-associated fatalities in the United States (US). Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended adoption of additional measures such as point of release testing (PORt) and/or pathogen reduction to safeguard against transfusionassociated sepsis. However, PORt poses logistical challenges, particularly in institutions with high-volume platelet utilization, while pathogen reduction is a high cost intervention. We evaluated a second bacterial culture to contend with residual risk. Study Design/Method: Phased implementation of secondary bacterial culture testing (BacT/ALERT TM ,BioMerieux, Inc., Durham, NC) was initiated in October 2016 for all platelets received at our institution. At time of receipt at the blood bank (day 3 post collection), products were sampled using a sterile connection device (TSCD TM , Terumo, Elkton, MD) and a sampling kit (Sam-pLok TM Sampling Kit, 10 mL, ITL BioMedical, Malaysia). Five mLs of product was transferred aseptically to BacT/ALERT BPA (aerobic) culture bottles using the same sampling device. Inoculated culture bottles were loaded into the BacT/ALERT incubator modules and incubated at 35C for three days. Results/Finding: A total of 9473/11,066 (85.6%) platelet products were successfully cultured (934/1373 [68.03%] and 1842/1912 [96.3%] in October 2016 and March 2017 respectively). Over the 6-month period, two true positive cultures were obtained (incidence of 1 in 4736 platelet products). The cultures grew Acinetobacter species (Case A) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus species (Case B); both positive results were obtained four days following collection. Repeat testing of Cases A and B grew the same organisms identified in the initial cultures. There was a co-component in our inventory (Case A) with negative initial and repeat cultures. None of the products were released for transfusion. The initial post-collection product cultures remained negative at the collection facility. Over the same time period, no false positives were detected. Implementation required hiring one additional dedicated FTE; the total cost (technologist time, equipment and related supplies) was calculated to be $US16.83 per product tested. The cost per averted case was $US79,707. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of implementation of a secondary bacterial culture test of apheresis platelets to interdict bacterially contaminated units and prevent septic transfusion reactions. This presents a low-cost strategy (as compared to pathogen reduction) to mitigate risk of septic transfusion reactions. Importantly, it offers a viable alternative to PORt in high volume institutions where logistic (e.g. time and personnel) constraints impede practical adoption of PORt. An increase in cases of blood culture positive transfusion reactions (BCPTR) was noted at our hospital; BCPTR was defined as bacterial culture positivity in the transfusion recipient and/or associated transfused blood product during investigation of a transfusion reaction. We sought to characterize the risk and clinical presentation of BCPTR at our institution. Study Design/Method: An analysis was conducted of all reported transfusion reactions at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) between January 2009 and December 2016. The data, extracted from hemovigilance records, were evaluated to determine the incidence of BCPTR; the severity and symptoms were evaluated in concordance with recipient data, including patient diagnosis, medications and clinical manifestations of the reaction. Bacterial culture results were evaluated for both patients and associated blood products (i.e. partially transfused or residual product in blood bag). Results/Finding: In the 7-year study period, a total of 3280 transfusions reactions were reported, 18 of which were BCPTR (0.55% of transfusion reactions). Of the 18 BCPTR, 15 (83%) were associated with apheresis platelets, 2 (11%) with red blood cells, and 1 (6%) with plasma. Recipient diagnoses spanned hematologic/oncology (n512), renal (n53), cardiac (n51), autoimmune (n51), and obstetrics (n51). An organism was identified in both the blood product and recipient in 10 (56%) cases; in 6 (33%) cases an organism was grown in the blood product but not the recipient; and in 2 (11%) cases an organism was isolated from the recipient only, due to inability to culture the product. The transfusion recipients in 5 of the 6 cases that did not isolate organisms in the recipients were on broad-spectrum antibiotics at the time of transfusion. Symptoms of BCPTRs included fever (83%), chills (67%), nausea and vomiting (50%), pain (27%) and dyspnea (22%). Blood pressure (BP) decreased in 22%, increased in 17%; 61% of reported BCPTRs had no change in BP. Conclusion: The signs and symptoms of BCPTRs are not specific and overlap both with underlying disease as well as other types of adverse transfusion associated events, thus contributing to delayed diagnosis and under-reporting. Furthermore, high rates of antibiotic use in transfusion recipients can mask symptoms of true septic transfusion reactions. Hospitals should consider expanding the clinical indications for culturing blood components that are implicated in transfusion reactions. Furthermore, excessively stringent criteria (CDC/NHSN Blood Safety Surveillance) for transfusion-transmitted infection, may contribute to misclassification of septic events in some recipients, particularly if on antibiotics.",

Essentially all existing data on the effect of IgG subclass on hemolytic transfusion reactions and HDFN, were generated using AHG specific for IgG subclasses. In recent decades, it has become appreciated that there are at least 29 natural human variants of IgG. In this study, the reactivity of IgG specific AHG was tested against all 29 known variants. Study Design/Methods: The heavy and light chain variable regions of an anti-K1 monoclonal antibody were sequenced and cloned into expression plasmids that fused variable regions (in frame) with each of the known 29 IgG variants. Plasmids were expressed by co-transfection into CHO cells. The resulting panel of antibodies were pre-incubated with K11 RBCs and were then subjected to testing with currently available IgG subtype specific AHG (monoclonal AHGs from Southern Biotech and Sanquin, polyclonal AHGs from Sanquin and The BindingSite). All testing was carried out by flow cytometry. Results/Findings: Polyclonal reagents against IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 had cross-reactivity with variants found in other IgG subclasses, and specific amino acids responsible were identified by site directed mutagenesis (table 1). Titrations of the AHGs did not identify a dilution at which crossreactivities were lost, but authentic targets were still detected. However, cross-reactivity could be neutralized by pre-incubating AHG with the crossrecognized IgG forms (against a third party antigen); the remaining reactivity recognized the intended IgG subtype without detectable cross-reactivity. No cross-reactivity was detected for polyclonal anti-IgG1 or for any of the monoclonal AHGs tested. Monoclonal anti-IgG3 had a blindspot for IgG3-04, due to the shorter hinge region on IgG3-04. No blindspots were detected in other monoclonal or polyclonal AHG. Conclusion: The relative quantitation of different IgG subtypes has been studied in multiple immune settings, and plays important roles in diagnosis and research of human disease, including immunohematology. Herein, we demonstrate that the reagents used to generate this body of knowledge suffer problems of cross-reactivities and blindspots. As such, the existing data regarding IgG subtype biology may have some inaccuracies as a result of these defects in IgG specific AHG.",

However, alloimmunisation remains a significant problem, even if prophylactic antigen matching is performed for C, E and Kell antigens. This is partly explained by different antigen frequency among Caucasian blood donors and African-American recipients, and by variants in the Rh blood group of people of African-descent. Blood group genotyping has been proposed as a potential way to alleviate this problem. The SCD cohort of a pediatric academic hospital was genotyped for RHD, RHCE and FY genes. The primary objective of our study was to evaluate whether compatible genotyped blood donors presenting similar Rh variants could be identified. Study Design/Methods: Since 2008, our local blood provider intensified recruitment of African-descent blood donors. These donors were phenotyped and genotyped for clinically relevant antigens by different means: GenomeLab SNP Stream, laboratory-developped assays and IDCoreXT. As of 2014, 205 SCD children were genotyped by sequencing RHD, RHCE and FY cDNAs after obtaining informed consent. Extended red blood cell phenotypes were done at diagnosis at the hospital. Patients' genotypes were compared to H ema-Qu ebec's donor database to attribute blood donors to specific patients. Results/Findings: From diagnosis until September 2016, 117 (57%) patients had been transfused and 14 had antibodies with known blood group antigen specificity: anti-C, anti-E (2), anti-hrb, anti-Fya, anti-Jka, anti-Jkb (2), anti-S, anti-M, anti-Sc2, anti-Leb (2). Seventeen patients (8.3%) were either D2 or partial D. RHCE results showed that 163 patients expressed a normal c antigen and 32 expressed partial c. As for e antigen, 163 had a normal antigen, 38 bore a partial antigen and 3 were weakly expressed. Fy(a2b2) phenotype was found in 182 (89%) patients. A total of 2606 genotyped blood donors of African-descent were available. The table below indicates the compatibility with these donors.",

We recently found that TNFA-308A, IL1B-511T cytokine polymorphisms, RHAG 808G>A and HLA-DRB1*15 alleles may predict a good responder phenotype (Sippert et al, Transfusion 2017) and that RHAG 808A and HLA-DRB*15 alleles are closely linked to RH alloimmunization. Based on this and considering the challenge to fulfill the transfusion needs of the patients with RH variants, we used these genetic markers to select responders and nonresponders SCD patients for transfusion with RH haplotype matching RBC units and evaluated the risk of alloimmunization. Study Design/Method: Our study included 96 non-alloimmunized patients with SCD, homozygous for HbS, receiving a range of 5-289 RBC units. RBC antigen phenotypes of each patient and history of RBC antibodies were obtained from the medical records and transfusion service computerized database. RBC genotyping was performed using wHEA, wRHD and wRHCE BeadChip arrays (BioArray Solutions, Immucor) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNFA-308G>A, IL1B-511C>T) and the RHAG 808G>A gene polymorphism were analysed by PCR-RFLP and TaqMan assays. HLA class II genotyping was performed using PCR-SSO. Results/Finding: Among 96 non-alloimmunized patients, 21 were homozygous or compound heterozygous for RH variant alleles. From those, 6 had RHAG 808A and/or HLA-DRB*15 alleles and at least one cytokine polymorphism (TNFA-308A or ILB1-511T) associated with risk of alloimmunization and were transfused with extended and RH haplotype matching RBC units. The other 15 patients with no risk factors associated with RBC alloimmunization were considered non-responders and were not transfused with extended and RH matching units. All patients were followed for one year and did not develop RBC antibodies. Conclusion: These findings contributed to the development of a transfusion strategy for non-alloimmunized SCD patients as typing for these polymorphisms could potentially help in the classification of responder and nonresponder SCD patients, allowing blood with high level of compatibility to be Five discrepant samples required sequencing. ID CORE XT identified three RHCE*ceAR samples encoding a partial c, and a partial e (predicted phenotype: Vweak, VS-) and 2 were confirmed by sequencing. The third sample was found to be RHCE*ceVS.01,RHCE*ceBI on sequencing (predicted phenotype V1,VS1). The 3 samples were typed as V1 (or ce S ) and VS1 (or e S ) by HEA. In addition, ID CORE XT accurately identified RHCE*ce[712G]in 2 samples. This SNP has been linked to various allelic variants affecting c and e antigenic expression. Both samples were predicted to be c1 by HEA.",

Such variations may be clinically significant when genotyping is used as a tool for providing matched blood. Discrepancies leading to differences in the predicted phenotype could affect unit selection. Despite the discrepancies between the 2 methods, the high concordance rate and the limitations of serology warrant further reconsideration for the need for serologic confirmation of extended phenotypes. Background/Case Studies: Over three decades ago, two independent groups published work suggesting a novel categorization of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) on the basis of DAT scores of agefractionated RBCs: Type I wAIHA, comprising 80% of patients, showed increased binding of autoantibodies to aged RBC, whereas Type II wAIHA autoantibodies (20% of patients) bound young and old RBCs with no apparent prejudice. Band-3 is a ubiquitously expressed RBC transmembrane protein which plays a vital role in maintenance of RBC structural integrity, cellular hemostasis, and regulation of senescence; and, has been suggested to be targeted by autoantibodies from patients with wAIHA. Band-3 is regulated through phosphorylation of key residues; its hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of normal RBC senescence, which causes band-3 to disengage from the cytoskeleton, increasing its lateral diffusion, thereby permitting the formation of band-3 aggregates forming new epitopes which are recognized by natural IgG autoantibodies causing phagocytosis and destruction of senescent RBCs. Type I wAIHA has been postulated to be caused by an exacerbation of normal RBC senescence. Study Design/Methods: In an effort to confirm and characterize the two wAIHA subtypes we age-fractionated whole blood samples from 22 patients with wAIHA on discontinuous PercollV R gradients and looked for differences in DAT results between less (young RBCs) and more dense (aged RBCs) fractions, fractionation patterns and band-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Results/Findings: We confirm that two distinct types of wAIHA can be identified based on autoantibody reactivity with the youngest and oldest autologous RBCs. Further, comparing 5 Type I and 5 Type II patients, we found that Type I is characterized by 5 PercollV R fractions (similar to healthy storage-matched controls) but increased band-3 tyrosine phosphorylation compared to healthy storage-matched controls, with phosphorylation occurring during younger stages of RBC development. Type II patients were characterized by 3-4 PercollV R fractions, lacking the fraction containing the oldest RBCs, and showed a complete lack of, or dramatic decrease in, band-3 tyrosine phosphorylation compared to healthy storage-matched controls.",

In Type I wAIHA, the increased binding of autoantibodies to older RBCs coupled with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of band-3 suggests that RBCs from Type I patients are aging faster than RBCs from normal healthy controls; this may represent an accelerated and pathogenic form of normal RBC senescence. In contrast, Type II wAIHA where autoantibodies bind strongly to either young or old RBCs coupled with a lack of fractionated bands that represent the oldest RBCs and a dramatic diminution in tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 suggests faster destruction of RBCs, consistent with the early published data, and metabolic changes that could affect RBC function.",

While RBC antigenic differences between donors and recipients are required for humoral immune responsiveness, other variables are also involved. Studies have shown that there is significant primary sequence identity between common RBC antigens and microbes, and that cross-reactivity is possible between antigens in experimental models. We hypothesize that responder populations may be immunologically primed to form RBC alloantibodies via environmental exposure to cross-reactive microbial antigens, and that such a correlation may be linked to observed blood group antigen immunogenicity. Study Design/Method: We performed peptide homology searches of the most immunogenic RBC antigens, based on previously published antigenicity findings. Thirteen amino acid peptides containing the polymorphic residues of K, Jk a , Lu a , E, c, M, C, Fy a , and S antigens were queried for identity with microbial peptides using the BLAST database (blastp, PAM30 ABSTRACT algorithm, E value51x10 -6 , Word Size5 6, Gap Costs: Existence59 Exten-sion51). Search results were restricted to bacteria and fungi, with a selective threshold of >80% identity set for inclusion criteria. To corroborate with observed patient data, we also examined preceding cultures from 162 alloimmunized patients to explore agreement between specific pathogens and RBC alloantibodies. Results/Finding: Significant peptide identity was found between RBC antigens and pathogenic organisms including B. fragilis, P. aeruginosa, Candida spp. among others. Linear regression analysis of the number of genuses in microbial kingdoms meeting inclusion criteria showed a statistically significant inverse trend in predicting the degree of immunogenicity when Fy a (an outlier) was removed (b5-0.0017, r 2 50.624 & p50.0197); that is, lower immunogenicity antigens were associated with larger number of kingdoms. k-medoids cluster analysis comparing immunogenicity and kingdoms showed that antigens clustered to low (C), moderate (E, c, S, M) and high (K, Jk a , Lu a , Fy a ) immunogenicity groups, suggesting that an antibody response is inversely associated with environmental antigenic prevalence.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Thromboelastogram (TEG) has been incorporated into many hospital armories to manage transfusions during cardiovascular (CV) surgeries. Some institutions use well-defined protocols for TEG utilization at different stages of surgery (baseline, rewarming, postprotamine, and post-operative). On the other hand, at some institutions TEG utilization is driven mainly by clinical judgment. When TEG is ordered based on clinical judgment (clinical bleeding in most cases), some patients receive blood transfusions before TEG is performed. There is no published literature on how pre-TEG transfusions impact TEG results and guide further transfusion requirements during CV surgeries. In this study, we have tried to address this issue. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively reviewed 109 TEGs performed on 76 patients undergoing CV surgeries at our institution from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2016. No specific TEG protocol was used to direct transfusions (plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate) during that period. Only the first TEG performed during surgery was included in the analysis. We excluded the patients that received only red blood cell (RBC) transfusions during the surgery because RBC transfusions are usually not based on TEG results. For the 56 TEGs analyzed, TEG results were divided into three categories: \"normal\" (reaction time (R), kinetics (K), angle (a), maximum amplitude (MA), and lysis at 30 minutes (min) all within reference range), \"hypocoagulable\" (R>10 min, K>3 min, a<53 degrees, MA<50 mm) and \"hypercoagulable\" (R<5 min, K<1 min, a>72 degrees, MA>70 mm). Fisher's exact tests and Z-scores for two population proportions were used to identify statistically significant differences in TEG results and blood product utilization. Results/Finding: Out of 56 TEGs analyzed, 37 patients (66%) received pre-TEG transfusions. We found significantly fewer hypocoagulable TEG results in pre-TEG transfused patients than nontransfused patients (8% vs. 32%, p50.02). The data also reflected a trend suggesting that there may be more normal TEG results in pre-TEG transfused patients compared with nontransfused (32% vs. 11%, p50.07). There was no statistically significant difference in transfusions after obtaining TEG results in both groups. However, there was a trend suggesting that hypocoagulable state was more likely to be corrected by transfusion in patients who were already transfused pre-TEG compared to nontransfused (100% versus 33%, p50.06). Conclusion: Pre-TEG transfusions impact TEG results (transfusions correct/normalize coagulopathy) but do not significantly impact further blood product utilization during CV surgeries. The decreased threshold (more transfusions) for correcting hypocoagulable state in patients who already received pre-TEG transfusions may be due to more clinical significant bleeding in these patients to begin with. Background/Case Studies: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with significant blood loss, due to the complexity of the procedure and extensive liver vascularity, demanding blood transfusion. In this setting, cell salvage autotransfusion (CS) is been used as an alternative to decrease allogeneic red blood cell transfusion. However, as long as some studies have shown that CS in OLT decreases allogeneic blood transfusion, others reported that CS presented little benefit or might have been associated with increased blood loss through fibrinolysis. In this study, we evaluate CS efficacy in reducing allogeneic blood transfusion in the intraoperative period. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively evaluated data from 670 liver transplants, performed from 2011 to 2015 in a single-center. Patients were divided in two groups: one with cell salvage (CS) and another without CS (NCS). Study endpoint included the requirement of allogeneic blood components transfusion during intraoperative period in both groups. CS was used in all liver transplant recipients but patients with malignancy and sepsis. Blood transfusions were indicated based on clinical and hemodynamic criteria. Clinical data included age, gender, diagnosis, body weight, height, warm and cold ischemic time and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Statistical analyses were performed using t-test, Chi-square test, Mann Whitney test. Results/Finding: In this study period, 670 OLTs were performed. A total of 345 patients was submitted to CS. The median age was 51 years (range 10-78 yo). Cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C virus infection was the main etiology of liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was found in 31,6% of the patients. The average MELD score was 29,6 6 9,4 and it was slightly higher in the CS group (31,3 vs 27,9, p<0,001) . There was no statistically significant difference in other variables such as body weight, height and cold ischemic time. The mean salvaged blood volume was 8856 6 4503 ml and mean reinfused blood volume was 914 6909 ml. Allogeneic blood transfusion was required in 71,8% patients in the CS group, compared to 46,7% patients in the NCS group. However, average red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units transfused were lower in the CS group. The threshold for RBC transfusion was significantly lower in the CS group (2,4 units vs 3,39 units, p<0,001 Background/Case Studies: Hemorrhage is a leading cause of mortality in trauma patients and morbidity in non-trauma patientsADDIN EN.CITE.DATA. Massive transfusion protocols (MTP) reduce mortality in trauma and nontrauma settings; however, this may be at the cost of blood product wasta-geADDIN EN.CITE.DATA. Blood product wastage benchmarks are loosely established, and data on wastage associated with MTPs especially sparse. With a redesign of MTP and Obstetric Massive Transfusion Protocols (OBP) which have different blood product preparation schedules, we assessed wastage, delivery method, and product utilization to identify differences in wastage during these protocols. Study Design/Method: Following Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective study on blood product wastage associated with the MTP and OBP between July 2015-December 2016 was performed. Data on numbers of products dispensed and wasted were manually collected from Transfusion Service paper and electronic records and an automated data report from the electronic medical record. Results/Finding: The MTP resulted in higher total number of wasted products than the OBP (27 and 15 products, respectively) however, OBP wastage occurred more frequently in the 18 month period. This reflects automatic thawing of cryoprecipitate in the first round of deployed products in the OPB. MTP-trauma activations contributed higher wastage than non-trauma activations (23 versus 4 products). This is skewed by one month when 20 products were wasted due to expiration of product on the floor. Cooler-related issues (6) and products dwelling too long out of a controlled environment (5) were common reasons reported for wastage. The overall product wastage rates for MTP: trauma, MTP: nontrauma, and OBP were 1.7%, 0.3%, and 2.3%, respectively, with a total exsanguination protocol waste rate of 1.33%. The difference between the overall proportion of waste between the MTP and OBP protocols was insignificant (p50.176).",

Transfusion of uncrossmatched products before sample collection can lead to errors and confusion in blood typing, as can the venipuncture site used for collecting the patient's blood sample. The current FDA guidance and AABB standard of two samples for determination of blood type to prevent cases Wrong Blood in Tube (WBIT) or electronic identification systems do not always catch or clarify these errors. Study Design/Methods: Patient was tested by manual tube method. Two different technologists using two different reagent racks performed initial testing with matching results. Results/Findings: Two samples were collected during resuscitation from the patient and typed as O D-. Patient was transfused with 5 units of O D-RBCs before stabilizing. Two days later another sample was collected and typed as O Rh positive (D1) with mixed field being seen on the anti-D. A weak D testing was performed to see if the negative result with anti-D could be strengthened through incubation. Both original samples still resulted as D- (table A) . After consulting the patient care team it was discovered the samples were collected above the IV site after one unit had been completed and while the second unit was being transfused. It was also discovered all other clinical laboratory samples were rejected due to possible line contamination when results for the sodium, potassium, and glucose appeared inaccurate. The transfusion service laboratory is in a different area of the hospital and was unaware those samples had been rejected. Conclusion: The initial samples were collected above the IV site and were contaminated with the D-blood product being rapidly transfused during resuscitation. The samples collected during the initial trauma response should have been rejected and a request made for samples drawn below the IV site. Because both samples were collected while the unit was being transfused, contamination was in both. Use of a handheld barcode system would not have caught this error because the patient had been correctly identified. Future prevention of the above anomaly would be the education of transfusion testing staff to recognize an abnormal high hematocrit: secondly reminding the staff collecting samples to be aware of the proper collection procedures for laboratory testing, which would include type and screen. Facilities also should strive to perform collection of the confirmatory sample from a completely different venipuncture site.",

Transfusion support for transplants can be tremendous, accounting for a large percentage of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions annually. Even the best practices for allogeneic transfusion are not without risk. Transmission of pathogens is possible with even the strictest screening methods, and each transfusion increases the risk of alloimmunization. The advent of intraoperative blood recovery has reduced the need for allogeneic donor RBCs during surgeries expected to bleed heavily. With the Cell SaverV R (HaemoneticsV R , Braintree, MA), patients' own blood shed during surgery is collected, washed, concentrated, and reinfused, lessening the need for transfusion support. This study sought to examine the amount of allogeneic donor RBC units saved during SOTs through the use of the Cell Saver for intraoperative blood recovery. Study Design/Methods: Data was collected for SOTs which utilized the Cell Saver. These included liver, liver/kidney combination, lung, and heart transplants. Data A 29 y.o. female was admitted to the trauma department after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and transfused 2 O(1) RBC units from the kiosk. Her blood type was determined as O(-) with a negative RBC antibody screen (AS). She was transfused 10 more units of O(-) RBC. Two months later, a repeat AS identified two new RBC alloantibodies, anti-D and anti-E. The anti-D formation resulted from the 2 O(1) RBC transfused from the kiosk, but the source of the anti-E was undetermined since E antigen is expressed in 1% of Rh(-) individuals. The trauma department staff was notified of delayed serologic transfusion reaction and asked to investigate further since a 29 y.o. female patient should not have received O(1) RBCs. Study Design/Method: An investigative plan was developed by the trauma staff involving a patient census, review of the chart and kiosk inventory, obtaining feedback from clinical providers, and review of information provided by emergency services (EMS). Results/Finding: The trauma unit was busy with 10 admissions during the 5 hours preceding the patient's arrival. The chart review found the following physical attributes; patient was overweight (107 kg) with obvious facial deformities from the MVC, that compromised age assessment. It was determined that the kiosk was fully stocked with both O(-) and O(1) RBC units. One clinical provider recalls that the patient identification (ID) might have been unknown. Review of the EMS communication states \"patient is a 50 y.o. female.\" Conclusion: Use of visual examination to determine age was significant in the selection of O(1) RBC for this patient. The trauma staff proposed and implemented a change in policy to prevent future incidents. Any female patient that arrives without ID or written confirmation of age will be transfused O(-) uncrossmatched RBC until a blood type can be determined.",

            "text": "Rate of ABO/Rh Confirmation in Outpatient Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery Alexis R Peedin*, Taylor Brueseke, Yara Park and Jay S Raval. University of North Carolina Background/Case Studies: Approximately 375,000 surgeries for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are performed annually. For abdominal pelvic floor disorder (PFD) surgeries, transfusion rates historically range from 6-16%, whereas transfusion rates for vaginal and robotic PFD surgeries range from 0.2-1.6% and 0.3-1.4%, respectively. Since the implementation of College of American Pathologists (CAP) requirements for ABO/ Rh confirmation, approximately 15% of patients who receive a transfusion in our hospital required a second ABO/Rh specimen to be drawn; however, limited data are available regarding the impact of this new requirement on patients preparing to undergo outpatient surgery that currently require preoperative Type & Screen (T&S). The primary objective of our study was to assess the rate of ABO/Rh confirmation in women who underwent outpatient POP surgery. Study Design/Method: This was a planned secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing POP surgical repair from May 2015 -May 2016 in our academic tertiary care institution. Among this sample, patients were excluded if their first T&S was drawn before our institution implemented the ABO/Rh confirmation requirement. Fisher's Exact Test was used, and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results/Finding: We identified 66 patients for analysis, of whom 65 (98.5%) had a preoperative T&S ordered. Two (3.1%) of these 65 patients had positive antibody screens; one patient had an anti-K and one had a warm-reacting autoantibody. Fifty-nine (90.8%) of the 65 patients required a second ABO/Rh specimen per hospital protocol; 51 (86.4%) of these actually had a second specimen drawn. In patients for whom ABO/Rh confirmation was indicated, there were no differences between those who did and did not have ABO/Rh confirmed when comparing age, body mass index (BMI), pre-operative hemoglobin (Hgb), or surgical approach (Table 1) . No ABO/Rh discrepancies were identified. One patient received 1 unit of red cells after abdominal POP surgery. Conclusion: The rate of requiring ABO/Rh confirmation before POP surgery was markedly higher than that seen in all patients receiving transfusions at our institution (90.8% vs. 15%, respectively). Because the vast majority of women undergoing vaginal or robotic POP surgery are not transfused perioperatively, hospital transfusion services should consider eliminating routine pre-operative T&S for this low-risk population in the maximum surgical blood ordering schedule, avoiding this unneeded test and subsequent ABO/Rh confirmation.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: One attribute of older blood is an increase in supernatant potassium level which can contribute to transient hyperkalemia. This problem is exacerbated in conditions of massive transfusion and in patients with renal failure. Washing RBCs can effectively remove free potassium but is time consuming and can often only be performed on one unit at a time. Here, we estimate the amount of potassium that is removed by volume reduction of red cell units. We also examined whether this technique would be feasible in the setting of massive transfusion in a patient with hyperkalemia. Study Design/Method: Expired or over temperature units (n527) that had been removed from inventory were utilized for these studies. Each unit was weighed and a volume reduction procedure was performed. The supernatant was weighed and the potassium of the supernatant was measured using routine laboratory assays. For all formulas, weight was converted to volume using a specific gravity of 1.05 g/ml. The Hematocrit (Hct) of the volume reduced RBC was measured using a Sysmex xs-1000i instrument. The percentage of supernatant removed was calculated by dividing the residual supernatant in the volume reduced unit (RBC Hct X RBC volume) by the total supernatant prior to the procedure (residual supernatant 1 removed supernatant). The remaining free potassium (mEq) was calculated as the (concentration of potassium in the supernatant (mmol/L) x the estimated red blood cell residual supernatant volume. To simulate the process that would occur in the setting of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP), 5 units were subjected to the volume reduction while recording the time needed to process all 5 units. This was performed twice for a total of 10 Units processed in this manner. Results/Finding: The volume reduction procedure reduced the supernatant volume by an average of 72% (range 49%-87%). In units between 21 and 42 days (n510), the estimated mean residual K1 was 1.89 mEq (Range 0.61 to 2.21). In the two mock MTP trials, the time to complete the procedure was approximately 50 minutes and we estimate an additional 5-10 minutes would be required to modify and issue the units in our LIS/EMR. Conclusion: A manual volume reduction protocol in red cell units significantly reduces the amount of potassium administered in a unit of red cells. This procedure may be useful when only older red cell units are available for a patient at risk for hyperkalemia. The procedure can be performed in less than one hour and may be useful under the conditions of massive transfusion. processing, cryopreservation, and non-specialized hospital collection. Preliminary studies of three shipping conditions after collection were tested using sterile containers with sterile normal saline (NS) alone, NS plus antibiotic/antimycotic (AB/AM) and a dry container. Prolonged exposure to AB/AM solution retarded outgrowth of MSCs, but control of microbial growth in cultured tissue samples was needed. These findings were used to construct a validation study. Study Design/Methods: A validation study designed to test procedures to collect, transport, process, and store umbilical cord tissue was measured by post-thaw outgrowth. Collected UC tissue from consenting mothers was transported to the distant lab in validated shipping containers in a dry, sterile cup from vaginal (3) and caesarian (2) births. UC collections were divided into 3 segments to test 3 conditions. Segment explants were placed on 0.1% gelatin-coated gridded tissue culture plates (32 explants per plate) in enriched medium specified for MSC outgrowth containing antibiotic only with an endpoint of 21 days. Growth was scored as the number of squares with explants exhibiting outgrowth compared to the total planted explants. One segment (fresh control) was dissected and planted without further processing. The 2 remaining tissue segments were soaked in (AB/AM) saline solution for 1 hr and 24 hrs at 48C, respectively. Tissue segments were frozen in cryo bags with a proprietary 10% DMSO/large molecular weight sugar solution. Background/Case Studies: It has been the practice in our institution to process 3 or 4 times the total blood volume (BV) of the patient, up to a maximum of 25 liters (L) per procedure, to obtain peripheral blood CD341 stem cells. As a consequence, a patient often would need to spend 6 hours or more on the machine. It would be desirable to be able to specify the exact volume of blood to process to achieve the desired CD341 cell yield, thus minimizing the patient's time on the machine, the nurse's time performing the procedure, and the number of bags that have to be submitted for cryopreservation and storage. Study Design/Methods: Our institution recently implemented the new Spectra Optia CMNC collection protocol, a continuous flow and continuous collection procedure that uses the Automated Interface Management (AIM) system to precisely manage the separation interface. An analysis of our 2016 collection data suggested a highly reliable collection process, so a prediction algorithm (PA) based on the linear regression between the patient's CD341 pre-count and CD341 yield, normalized per liter of blood processed, was derived utilizing the patient's CD341 pre-count, the patient's weight in kilograms (Kg), and the target CD341 dose/Kg. This PA calculated the exact volume of whole blood to be processed to achieve the requested dose of peripheral CD341 stem cells. The initial equation was modified to add an additional 15% to the predicted volume, to account for the natural variability of the process. This PA was then tested prospectively in the clinical setting. Results/Findings: In 8 patients, representing both allogeneic and autologous donors, the average blood volume processed was 14.8 L. The range was 4.9 L -21.6 L. The target dose was achieved in all patients. Our previous practice for these 8 patients would have required, assuming a standard 4 BV procedure, processing an average of up to 28 L per patient, with a range of 20-62 L. To quantify how well the new PA works, it was decided to evaluate the ratio between actual and predicted volume vs. the ratio between the actual and expected CD341 yield. The result was a high correlation between these two ratios (R 2 5 0.92), indicating that the algorithm produces very consistent results. Conclusion: The predictability of our collection process during the time period analyzed was a robust R 2 5 0.92, confirming the findings in the first data analysis. The blood volumes processed and patient time on the machine decreased substantially, with some patients only needing 2 hours or less to achieve their target dose. Nurses and lab medical technologists have seen a dramatic change in their workflow. The number of bags to process has dropped for the lab, with the consequent freezer space savings and the shorter collection times allowing the lab medical technologists to finish with their work earlier in the day. All in all, implementation of this PA has produced huge increases in patient and provider satisfaction. Important factors that likely contributed to the success of the protocol included the precision and consistency of the AIM system of the apheresis device, as well as the small number of nurses (1-2) who performed the procedures, resulting in less variability. The economic impact of this PA has not been quantified, but might be an interesting area for future studies. Background/Case Studies: ZarzioV R , a biosimilar granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) has recently been introduced into clinical practice. Its use has stimulated a certain debate regarding their possible less efficacy and security on CD341 mobilization. The aim of this study is to evaluate if there are differences between good and bad mobilizers and assess the need for plerixafor when a biosimilar as G-CSF is used. Study Design/Method: We retrospectively evaluated autologous mobilization processes performed between June 2015 and March 2016. Patients (n525) evaluated were diagnosed with malignant lymphoma (n515), multiple myeloma (n59) and Primary Amyloidosis (n51) and were mobilized according to standard protocols. Collection CD341 cellularity target was established ! 2x10E6/kg. Two groups, good and bad mobilizers, have been determined. Predictors of unsuccessful mobilization were defined by >65 years old, previous fludarabine, lenalidomide, or bendamustine treatments or !2 previous regimens, present peripheral cytopenias, active disease and previous mobilization failure. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare means and comparisons of medians were performed by the median test. CD341 count was performed according ISHAGE protocol. Adverse events (AE) were analysed according to CTCAE v4.0. Results/Finding: The media (range) general collection parameters were: CD341 (day 5) 27.50/mL (4.5-157.5/mL), blood volume processed 23204mL (9718-39618mL) and 4.96 (2-7.30) exchanged volemias. Seventeen patients were considered bad mobilizers, 7 needed plerixafor and 5 had to undergone a collection procedure twice. There were statistically significant differences between both groups on mobilization characteristics and product cellularity [mean (SD) ); p50.071]. There were no significant differences on mobilization characteristics and product cellularity between both groups. Five mobilization AE were observed [muscle pain (n52), fever (n52) and flu syndrome; all grade 1]. Two patients could not undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due low CD341 cellularity. Conclusion: There are differences between products collected from the good mobilizer (rich in GM and CD34) versus poor mobilizer (with plerixafor) rich in CN and CMN. The mobilization with ZarzioV R could be smaller than expected since there are no significant differences if we compare the good mobilizers versus the bad mobilizers although the number of cases studied can be limiting. Background/Case Studies: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely studied and have shown beneficial effects on tissue regeneration, immunomodulation, and improvement of multiple organ failure caused by infection, sepsis, and trauma. However, MSCs express tissue factor, which may be a risk factor for thrombosis especially if administrated systemically following trauma when coagulopathies are common. Before applying MSCs in a preclinical animal model, we sought to determine the procoagulant properties of rat MSCs in vitro. Study Design/Methods: Bone marrow and adipose derived MSCs (BMSC and AMSC) were isolated from bones (femur and tibia) and visceral fat tissue in normal young Sprague Dawley rats respectively. Both BMSCs and AMSCs were cultured and passaged using DMEM medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. BMSC and AMSC at passage 2-5 were used in this study. The tissue factor expression of MSCs was determined by immunohistochemistry. Citrated whole blood collected from normal rats was treated with rat BMSCs and AMSCs at low, medium and high doses (1.5 3 10 4 /ml, 7 3 10 4 /ml and 1.5 3 10 5 /ml respectively). The prothrombin time (PT), coagulation properties and platelet aggregation (response to ADP, collagen and PAR4) were measured by hemostasis analyzer, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and impedance aggregometry (Multiplate) respectively within 30min and 2hr after incubation. Results/Finding: Tissue factor was significantly expressed among both BMSC and AMSC at all passages in vitro. BMSC and AMSC at any dose and time of treatment neither shortened nor elongated PT in whole blood. However, both BMSC and AMSC significantly shortened the clotting time (CT) (None: 334 6 35 seconds, versus low, medium and high doses of AMSC (145 6 2, 111 6 6, and 75 6 12 seconds), and BMSC (155 6 2, 90 6 10, 80 6 7.0 seconds), p<0.05), clot formation time (CFT, p<0.05) and increased alpha angle (p<0.05) by NATEM measurement, but did not significantly affect the CT, CFT and alpha angle by EXTEM. Maximum clot firmness (MCF) and fibrinolytic index were not affected by MSCs. There was no significant impact of both BMSC and AMSC on platelet aggregation simulated by ADP, collagen and PAR4. No significant differences of hemostatic and platelet function were found between the treatments of BMSC and AMSC. Conclusion: Consistent with reports from human derived MSC, both rat BMSC and AMSC significantly expressed tissue factor in both early and late passages, which led to a significant decrease in clotting time at various dose and time of treatment. However, MSCs had no direct impact on platelet aggregation in vitro. As considering the procoagulant capability of MSCs, future study will be necessary to determine the optimal dose and safety of using MSCs for systemic application in vivo.",

Background/Case Studies: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are beneficial for tissue regeneration, immunomodulation and improvement of multiple organ failure caused by infection, sepsis, and trauma. MSCs express tissue factor (TF) that activate the clotting cascade and interfere hemostasis. Hypoxia is a condition that occurs after trauma globally during shock or at the site of injury, and is known to change or influence the phenotypes of cells, including MSCs.

Both BMSCs and AMSCs were cultured using DMEM medium with 20% fetal bovine serum under either normoxia (20% O 2 ) or hypoxia (3.5% O 2 ). MSC growth curves were measured by cell counter. The TF expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. CD90/CD29 and CD45 were measured as positive and negative markers of MSC respectively by flow cytometry. The citrated rat whole blood was treated with MSC (1.5 3 10 5 /ml) either from normoxia or hypoxia. The coagulation properties were measured by hemostasis analyzer and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Results/Finding: Hypoxia potentiated the growth of BMSC by 15%, but depressed the growth of AMSC by 30% at day 5 in comparison to normoxia. Both BMSC and AMSC equally expressed CD90 and CD29 but not CD45 under any culture condition. Tissue factor was significantly expressed among BMSCs and AMSCs from both normoxia and hypoxia. Whole blood treated with BMSCs and AMSCs from normoxia significantly shortened the clotting time (CT: 468 6 64 (control), versus 170 6 13 (BMSC), and 195 6 60 (AMSC) seconds) by NATEM. Hypoxia also significantly shortened CT (165 6 20 (BMSC), 169 6 50 (AMSC) seconds, p<0.05 as compared to control), but the changes in CT were not significantly different between BMSCs and AMSCs. Maximum clot firmness (MCF) and fibrinolytic index did not change after treatment with BMSC and AMSC regardless of the normoxia or hypoxia conditions. Conclusion: Tissue factor is constitutively expressed in rat BMSCs and AMSCs. Adjustment of the MSC culture condition to hypoxia did not affect tissue factor expression or the procoagulant properties of MSC (BMSC and AMSC). This study also suggests that the procoagulant properties will not be affected if MSCs are recruited into injured tissues with hypoxic environments. Future study will be necessary to determine the optimal dose MSC and whether it is safe to use MSCs for systemic application in trauma.",

National Institutes of Health Background/Case Studies: Current early-phase clinical gene therapy trials use freshly collected or cryopreserved CD341 cells as the starting fraction prior to gene manipulation. Following gene-transduction and culture, the end product is infused fresh into recipients. For wider applicability and scale-up, gene therapy manufacturing protocols would benefit from double-end cryopreservation (DEC) of CD341 cells during manufacture (i.e. immediately post-collection and again, post-gene modification). DEC helps delink patients' preparative conditioning phase from cell manufacture, eases logistics of inter-facility cell transportation, and ensures fulfillment of regulatory product release criteria before infusion. Our objective was to study the effects of DEC on gene transduced mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) CD341 cells. Study Design/Method: Cryopreserved CD341 cells from 2 healthy adult donors were thawed and transduced (TR) in RetroNectin coated tissue culture bags with an EF1-alpha-YFP lentivirus (2.5% concentration) and media (X-VIVO-10, human serum albumin(HSA), 100 ng/mL each of cytokines (SCF, TPO and FLT3-L) over 2 days. Untransduced (UTR) cells were cultured as controls. TR and UTR fractions were re-cryopreserved. A standard freeze-mix of 5% DMSO, 6% Pentastarch, HSA, plasma-Lyte A was used for cryopreservation.",

Results/Finding: TNC recovery decreased gradually in the donor samples at each step. Transduction efficiency, CD34%, CFUs were similar before and after PT2. HSCs ranged from 824 to 1655 cells/10 6 CD341 cells in the PT2-TR arm compared to a range of 286 to 1416 /10 6 CD341 cells after PT1. Viability, % CD341 and CFUs were lower in the TR compared to the UTR arm. This difference was not altered after PT2 (Table) . Conclusion: DEC of MPB human CD341 cells decreases TNC recovery, but has minimal effects on CD341 cell phenotype, transduction efficiency and cell function. HSC numbers were within acceptable range after recryopreservation. Lower viability and CD34% in the TR arm compared to the UTR arm is likely due to vector toxicity. This was unaffected by recryopreservation. Additional studies to assess DEC mediated changes on CD341 cell early apoptotic markers, telomere lengths, gene expression and engraftment potential in NOD/SCID mice will inform clinical trials. Background/Case Studies: Autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation has been used as a powerful resource during the treatment of some hematological malignancies. Cryopreservation of these cells is routinely performed to allow for patient adequate conditioning and chemotherapy. In some cases, PBSC are harvested as a backup option and remain stored for several years, although effect of storage lesion in this product is still controversial. Our work presents retrospective data on PBSC infusion after long-term storage. Study Design/Method: All products were harvested after patient mobilization with G-CSF by apheresis with COBE Spectra V R . Flow cytometry analysis of CD341 cells was performed prior to cryopreservation. The cryoprotective solution was freshly prepared by addition of 20% hydroxyethyl starch, 18% human serum albumin and 10% DMSO at final concentration. PBSC were cryopreserved by direct immersion on -808C mechanical freezer (dump freeze) and stored until transplantation. Post-thaw viability was determined from stored cryotube samples by Trypan Blue exclusion minutes prior to infusion. Cells were thawed and infused on bedside. Engraftment was defined as the first day of 03 consecutive days of neutrophil count >0.5 x10 9 /L and platelet count >20 x10 9 /L after 07 days. with G-CSF for four days and patients with G-CSF for five days with use of Mozobil when CD341 was below 10 x 10 6 cells/L on the fourth day. HPC collection was performed on the fourth day of mobilization for healthy donors and on the fifth day for patients. All procedures were realized based on a prediction algorithm using pre-CD341 on the day of the collection and estimating WBC liters to be processed to obtain sufficient stem cells for the transplant. This algorithm was designed using linear regression of peripheral blood CD341 on the day of the collection versus collected CD341 per liter of blood processed. There was no distinction between patients and donors, once the efficiency coefficient was used for both. Collected material was sent to analysis and total CD341 was calculated. Final laboratory count of CD341 per kilogram was compared with the number predicted by the algorithm with Spearman's correlation to evaluate whether the formula is effective. Calculations were made using IBM SPSS 23 Software. Results/Findings: Among patients collecting HPC for autologous transplantation, 69,23% needed only one day of HPC harvesting, while 25,64% needed two days and 5,13% needed three or more days. Our collection efficiency (CE) and standard error of the mean (SEM) was 49 1-2,91%. After comparing predicted values with CD341 collected in the final product, we found a very strong correlation of 0.873 (p<0.01) for patients and a strong correlation 0.653 for healthy donors (p<0.01). Conclusion: The use of a mathematical model with a prediction algorithm is safe, has low cost and provides a good tool to estimate WB liters to process and avoid unnecessary procedures in both patients and healthy donors.

Units were rapidly thawed and rinsed in DPBS, then 25 pieces were excised from each using a biopsy punch. Pieces from each unit were explanted in a 5x5 grid pattern in MSC-supportive medium and incubated for 7 days, after which the tissue was discarded and media exchanged. Cells were isolated on the 14 th day, counted, and subcultured for two passages. At the end of each passage, cells were collected, counted and population doubling time was calculated. Isolated cells from each unit were also evaluated for MSC immunomarkers. Results/Finding: Small, proliferative cells with fibroblastic morphology were obtained from all explants, yielding a 100% success rate. Cells were positive for the MSC markers CD73, CD90, and CD105 (98.8 6 0.7%, 98.7 6 0.6%, and 97.8 6 0.6%, respectively) and negative for the hematopoietic markers CD34/45 (1.1 6 0.7%).

The present work demonstrates that the long-term cryopreservation of UC tissue does not disrupt the ability to isolate functional MSCs from the tissue at a later date. Importantly, growth characteristics of isolated MSCs appear to be comparable to those reported for MSCs from fresh UC tissue. Based on the consistent isolation and lack of apparent impact on proliferation kinetics, it is reasonable to expect cell yields in the range anticipated for therapeutic requirements and more than sufficient for moving to clinical grade bioreactors for expansion.

More experience accumulates in the immunomodulatory effect of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusion in numerous immunopathological disorders -such as GvHD -and signals. MSCs have a HLArestrictive and non-immunogenic nature. Study Design/Method: We have evaluated the efficacy of MSC transfusions in cases of acute GvHD refractory to conventional immunosuppressive treatment. The patients with steroid-resistant GvHD had received third-party MSCs (derived from Wharton's jelly and bone marrow) 4 times per case weekly at a dose of 1 million cells/kg. Clinical response was assessed 28 days after administering the first dose. Complete remission was defined as the complete disappearance of symptoms. Partial remission was assessed by the significant relief of symptomsand by the general improvement of the patient's condition. Results/Finding: In all 12 patients had received 13 cycles of MSCtreatment (4 dose per cycle). The median age was 47 years old (19-56) with a male/female ratio of 1:2. Distribution of the original malignancies (n): acute myeloid leukemia: 6; acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 2; myelofibrosis: 1; myelodysplastic syndrome: 1; multiple myeloma: 1; T-cell lymphoma: 1. Nine patients had undergone allogeneic HSCT with matched unrelated donors, the other three had stem cells derived from HLA-identic relatives. The first episode of GvHD after HSCT was started on the median 63rd day (7-455). The involved organs were skin (2), gut (4), skin and gut combined (7) and even lung in 3 cases. The median time of MSC's first infusion was 274 days after the stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 165 (19-1974) days after the first episode of GvHD. 4 of the 13 cycles of MSC-treatment led to complete remission (30.8%) and 7 resulted inpartial remission (53.8%). Conclusion: We have evaluated MSC-therapy as an effective treatment of GvHD in the majority of the observed cases with 83% overall cumulative response rate. The application of third-party MSCs offers a promising alternative in the therapy of GvHD and other GvHD-associated complications after HSCT. Further research is needed to determine the optimal start of the treatment, along with the issue of long-term safety. Background/Case Studies: Stem cell collection by leukapheresis for transplantation is a significant endeavor for the patient and the clinical team. Whether the collection is allogenic or autologous, the patient undergoing the collection and the physicians caring for the patient are always concerned whether they will be able to harvest enough cells for transplantation and engraftment. A typical goal for most adult procedures is 2 million CD341 cells/kg. If a patient does not reach this goal on the day of the procedure, they will likely have to return the following day to undergo a second procedure to reach the desired goal. Given the logistical challenges in planning transplantation, it is reasonable to attempt to optimize the number of cells collected while minimizing the number of collections. Measuring a patient's CD341 cells/mL in their peripheral blood before the leukapheresis procedure has been used to predict if the collection will successfully reach the 2 million cells/kg goal. The ideal minimum CD341 cells/mL that will lead to successful harvest has not been conclusively identified. Study Design/Methods: We analyzed the collection data from 55 patients to evaluate the predictive value of the CD341 cells/mL level. Data was collected over 6 months from every patient who underwent a stem cell collection. Four patients were allogenic donors and 51 were autologous donors. The patients' weight, diagnosis, and pre-procedure CD341 cells/mL level were all collected. The run time, amount of volume processed, and the absolute viable CD341 cells collected were recorded. The collection efficiency and the CD341 cells/kg were calculated for each patient. Results/Findings: Our data showed a strong linear correlation between pre-procedure CD341 cells/mL and post-procedure CD341 cells/kg (r50.95). Any patient who had a pre-procedure CD341 cells/mL count of 29 or greater had a collection of at least 2 million cells/kg. Any patient who had a pre-procedure CD341 cells/mL count of 16 or less collected less than 2 Conclusion: The pre-procedure CD341 cells/mL level in the peripheral blood has a very strong predictive value for the post-procedure CD341 cells/kg level. To confidently know that a patient will be able to produce the desired 2 million cells/kg, a pre-procedure CD341 cells/mL count of at least 29 should be obtained. For any patient with a count below 16, they should be counseled that their collection is likely to take at least a second day and a second procedure. Further studies, including potentially lengthening the run time and the volume processed, to evaluate how to handle the patients who fall between 16 and 29 CD341 cells/mL should be conducted.",

Engraftment times using the new Hetastarch formula were compared to the previous engraftment times with no significant difference. Conclusion: A change in the formulation of a cryoprotectant solution represents a major change that could have a significant impact on quality. In addition, maintaining the current 5% DMSO final concentration was critical as post thaw washing is not performed at the clinical site, history demonstrating a very low toxicity rate with the existing formulation. This study demonstrated the acceptability of the Hetastarch formulation using 5% DMSO and 1.7% Hetastarch to replace Pentastarch in the cryoprotectant formulation used for cryopreservation of HPC, Apheresis products. Background/Case Studies: Autologous stem cell transplantation is usually performed with mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Traditional mobilization regimens include granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without chemotherapy, but have failure rates ranging from 5% to 40%. Plerixafor is an adjunct agent used to improve mobilization in many clinical settings. However, its high cost is a significant concern. The manufacturer-recommended dose is 0.24 mg/kg, therefore patients weighing >100 kg would require a second vial, thus doubling the drug cost.",

If proven, this data would suggest there are genetic factors that modulate a person's ability to mobilize stem cells as they age and that these genetic factors differ between ethnic groups. This small data set would suggest that people of Hispanic ethnicity maintain a more robust and quickly responsive stem cell pool, even as they age. Further studies of larger cohorts are needed to validate this observation. If proven, this has far reaching implications within the stem cell research and therapy arena. Background/Case Studies: An update in HPC apheresis collection software led to higher collection volume in the organization's human progenitor cell (HPC) products without a corresponding increase in total cellular counts. Incorporation of a volume reduction step was therefore warranted as larger product volumes require additional time to transfuse and lead to a larger DMSO load to the recipient, often resulting in the need to transfuse over several days. The objectives of this study were to develop suitable mock HPC (mHPC) products and evaluate the effectiveness of the BioSafe PeriCell volume reduction technology on white blood cell (WBC) recovery and viability. Study Design/Method: HPC products are not readily available for development. mHPC were created from whole blood buffy coats (BCs). Fresh ABO compatible BCs were pooled and concentrated using centrifugation and manual extraction of supernatant and red cells. The mHPC products were then diluted in plasma to produce an appropriate concentration and volume. HPC collection data from last 3 years was analyzed to determine the 95 th percentile, median and 5 th percentile values for both HPC volume and WBC concentration. Six mHPC products were tested; three high WBC (234 x 10 6 cell / mL) and three low WBC (114 x 10 6 cells / mL) concentrations, each at high (505 mL), low (265 mL) and median (355 mL) volumes. Each unit was processed sequentially from high, median and low volumes. Hence, the highest mHPC volume was processed for volume reduction first with a Sepax 2 (PeriCell Protocol, CS.430.1 kits), analyzed and then reconstituted and volume adjusted to the next volume target before being volume reduced again, and so forth. One additional mock product was prepared for a reproducibility study and was volume reduced three times. WBC concentration and 7-AAD viability was determined before and after each volume reduction. A control sample was removed from the product prior to processing and sat on the bench top until the end of the protocol to assess the change in cell concentration and viability over time.",

Each aliquot was tested for baseline total nucleated cell (TNC) count and viability, and for final TNC recovery, Trypan Blue (TB) viability, CD34 7-AAD viability, and potency (CFU). The effect of longterm exposure to DMSO was assessed by visually inspecting the product for aggregates and measuring viability up to 3 hours post thaw. The second in vivo phase included use of an infusion pump for 10 consecutive autologous patients, with comparison of infusion and transplant outcomes to 18 previous infusions by gravity drip. Comparison variables included infusion rate, adverse events (AE), and engraftment time. Results/Finding: No significant differences were observed between infusion pump and drip for the 2 products tested in vitro, including TNC recovery, cell viabilities, and potency. For both methods TNC TB viability decreased by more than 20% within 1 hour, while CD341 cell viability remained stable up to 3 hours post thaw. Small aggregates appeared after 1 hour for both methods and increased by a similar rate over time. Comparison of infusion and transplant outcomes between drip and infusion pump patients showed no significant differences for all measured variables. Engraftment time was similar for both groups. ANC days to engraftment for pump and drip were 10.8 6 1.3 and 11.6 6 1.0, respectively (p-value50.075). Platelet days to engraftment for pump and drip were 17.9 6 2.2 and 20.2 6 5.0, respectively (p-value50.207). Infusion rates were slightly higher for the pump group. For control patients, 2 required transfer of products to syringes due to slow infusion rate and 2 others experienced allergic and hypotension infusion adverse events. Conclusion: No significant in vitro or clinical differences were observed between thawed PBSCs infused by gravity or an infusion pump. These results demonstrate that the use of a pump for PBSC infusion is safe, provides consistent infusion rates, eliminates the need to transfer products to syringes, and results in comparable engraftment times. Donor racial distribution among the 278 ZIKV ineligible CBUs was: Caucasian 52%, Asian 9%, Black/AA 20%, and Multi-race 21%. Racial distribution of all clinical CBU donors was Caucasian 49%, Asian 15%, Black/AA 20%, and Multi-race 17%, suggesting there is no race correlation for this risk factor driven by cultural habits such as family travel. There were no cases in which onlythe sexual partner's potential exposure determined donor's ineligibility. Conclusion: Our study indicates that currently the leading risk factor for ineligible CB donors is potential exposure to ZIKV: 78% of all ineligible CBUs and 21% of all banked CBUs in the study period. We anticipate the number of cases to decrease following maternal education and travel warnings. Recognizing the importance of ZIKV in public health, and its potential transmission via HCT/P products, an FDA approved screening test for HCT/ P donors becomes a timely necessity.

Study Design/Method: A 10 mL aliquot was removed from ABO/Rh grouped, leucocyte depleted RBC units (n 5 20), which were stored in SAGM for 22 days, to act as untreated controls. The remainder of each unit ($270 mL) underwent treatment with the rejuvenation solution (50mL, 60minutes at 37 o C), followed by cell washing twice in SAGM ('manual' centrifuge-based process). To represent current transfusion laboratory practice, units were crossmatched against plasma from 39 random donors, using both Diamed gel column and glass tube technique. Phenotype investigation with commercial antisera was performed to identify the effect the rejuvenation solution treatment exerted on RBC surface antigens (A, B, D, C, c, E, e, K, M, N, S, s, P 1 , Lu a , k, Kp a , Kp b , Le a , Le b , Fy a , Fy b , Jk a , and Jk b ), including whether it exposed crypt antigens (T, Tn, Tk*, Th, Tx*, and CAD). Crossmatch and phenotype agglutination scores observed for the untreated and treated RBCs were then compared. Results/Finding: Crossmatch findings were defined as compatible, suitable, and incompatible. The study identified no difference between the crossmatch reaction profiles of untreated and treated RBCs. Furthermore, no difference was observed in the phenotypic state between untreated and treated RBCs. Conclusion: Treatment of 22 day old stored RBCs with the rejuvenation solution had no effect on crossmatch reaction profiles or phenotypic state when compared to matched untreated samples.

Platelet counts were performed using an ABX Micros 60. PC were centrifuged at 1250g in a Sorvall RC3C1 Centrifuge (Sorvall, USA) for 10 min. The combination cryoprotectant DMSO1Dextran (CryoSure Dex40, Germany) was used for PC cryopreservation. Cryopreserved PC (CPC) were frozen and stored in a Kelvinator chest freezer. CPC were thawed at 37 degrees C (Barkey plasmatherm) for 10 min. CPC osmolality was measured with an Osmomat 030 osmometer. Results/Finding: Staged platelet cryopreservation technology has been developed. Platelets were cryopreserved in a closed system (Patent No.: RU 169287 U1). During the first stage, CPC were spun to separate a plateletrich plasma (PRP) fraction from platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The second step was to resuspend the PRP by adding a combination of DMSO1Dextran (CryoSure Dex40) , as a cryoprotectant, to obtain a final concentration of 5% DMSO in the platelet suspension. The Injectomat MC Agilia and NPBI Compomixer M3 were instrumental in automating that phase. PC to be frozen had an osmolality of no less than 1500 mOsm/L. PRP and PPP were frozen at a cooling rate of 1-38C/min and stored at -85 0 in the chest freezer for up to 24 months. Pre-transfusion defrosted platelets were also processed in a closed system (Patent No.: RU 167874 U1). Our transfer set made it possible to automate platelet resuspension in plasma through the agency of the Exadrop V R . Post-thaw PRP was resuspended in plasma, which lowered the osmolality to 380 mOsm/L. Freeze-thaw recovery of platelets was 80% or more of the original population. Defrosted PC were stored at 20-24 0 with continuous gentle stirring from a Helmer platelet agitator for no longer than 4 hours before transfusion. It took no more than 30 min to cryopreserve PC and process pre-transfusion thawed platelets. The automated processing accounted for the bulk of the time (over 20 min). Conclusion: The automated technique developed reduced the workload while offering reproducibility of the procedure and high CPC quality. The use of closed systems ruled out bacterial contamination. Employing the infusion pump, platelet stirrer and precision flow regulator enabled adequate osmolality monitoring.",

This evaluation will compare culture based and rapid based test methods for detecting bacterial contamination in apheresis platelets. Study Design/Method: A large community blood center and transfusion service collects leukoreduced apheresis platelets (LRAP) using Amicus Separator System (Fenwal, Lake Zurich, IL) and Trima Accel System (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). Previously-cultured LRAP units were sampled on day 4 for secondary culture using BacT/ALERT (BioMerieux, Durham, NC) and rapid bacterial tests using BacTx (Immunetics, Boston, MA) and PGD (Verax, Marlborough, MA). If LRAP unit is still available, it is also sampled and tested for rapid testing on day 5. A total of 60 LRAP units were tested over a 3-month period: 50 were cultured and rapid tested on day 4; 10 were rapid tested on day 5. The rapid test methods were also evaluated based on cost, ease of use, incubation time and indication for use. Results/Finding: Of the LRAP units evaluated for this study, there were 59 True Negatives (TN) and 1 False Positive (FP) on day 1 when tested by BacT/ALERT, with 60 TNs on day 4. BacTx testing results showed 50 TNs on day 4 and 10 TNs on day 5. Testing using the PGD kit showed 50 TNs on day 4; and 8 TNs and 2 FPs on day 5. FP results were confirmed by performing a secondary culture, which were found to be negative. BacTx requires a specific analyzer and 30 minutes are required for result interpretation. There is no instrument requirement for PGD and reactions can be read within 20 minutes. Conclusion: The results of this evaluation makes PGD the best fit for this blood center based transfusion service. PGD offers a shorter time for reading of results, does not need an initial investment for an analyzer and is indicated for LRAP in 100% plasma and LRAP in PAS/plasma. Its ease of use allows for testing of LRAP on day 4 and day 5 during the night shift to be accomplished without additional staffing and allows to extend outdate to 7day storage of LRAP.",

Study Design/Method: Serum produced from 500 mL whole blood donations from non-remunerated healthy donors was quickly frozen. After frozen storage at <-258C for 3-12 months and controlled thawing, six different sera were used to fill a large number of mini (140 lL) containers, which were refrozen and stored at either -188C or <-258C. During storage at 3 months intervals, samples were tested for several growth factors, using MagpixV R Luminex Multiplex assays and compared to control samples stored at <-808C. Growth factors tested were PDGF-AA&AB/BB, TGF-\u00df1/2/3, VEGF, 80A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 EGF, FGF2. The study was a fact-finding study, without preset acceptance criteria. Results/Finding: PDGF-AB/BB and TGF-\u00df1 were the most abundant growth factors, on average 35, resp. 40 ng/mL. Also PDGF-AA was detected at relatively high concentration in human serum, on average 11 ng/mL. TGF-\u00df2, EGF and VEGF were detected at relatively low values, resp. 3 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 0.3 ng/mL. Average levels of FGF2 and TGF-\u00df3 were close to detection limit (< 0.2 ng/mL). The controls stored at <-808C showed for all growth factors close to 100% of the initial values in samples at T50 (moment of filling mini containers). For serum stored at <-258C for up to 12 months, most factors showed less than 2 % decrease, except for PDGF-AA and TGF-\u00df2, showing 6% resp. 3% lower values. For serum stored at -188C the values for TGF-\u00df1, EGF and VEGF were stable, whereas PDGF-AB/BB, PDGF-AA and TGF-\u00df2 showed a decrease of resp. 9, 17 and 3%. Conclusion: Human serum eye drops can be stored in the new micro dose device at -188C (3-star household freezers) or <-258C (professional freezers) for at least one year after preparation without large decreases in growth factor content. The maximum decrease was found for PDGF-AA in serum stored at -188C.

Results/Findings: On day 5, apheresis and WBD units had significantly greater residual platelets in comparisons to RCF (vs: apheresis p<0.01, WBD p<0.05) and WBF (vs: apheresis p<0.0001, WBD p<0.01) methods. While RCF units yielded the lowest count of Platelet-EVs (CD41a1) on day 5 and 42, the highest number of Platelet-EVs were in apheresis (day 5) and in WBD (day 42). Similarly, there was significant difference among methods in the number of WBC-EVs (CD31, CD141, CD161, CD191, CD66b1) and RCF contained the smallest concentration. Moreover, both TRPS and FC showed an increase in the total number of EVs on day 42 vs day 5 in all of the processing methods. Noteworthy, TRPS showed that the number of small EVs/exosomes (< 200 nm) was greater than large EVs (! 200 nm) in all of the products on day 5 and 42, and the highest level of EVs < 200 nm were in apheresis units. TRPS results also showed a significant difference in the EVs size-profile amongst all RBC products (p<0.05). Conclusion: This study shows that the method of manufacturing significantly affects RBC and non-RBCs EVs characteristics throughout storage, which has the potential to impact quality and safety of RBC products. The differences in the EVs cell-of-origin, concentration, and size-profile observed between manufacturing methods, warrants further examination of their potential immunomodulatory effects and clinical consequences.",

Slichter 3 and Andrew P Cap 2 . 1 US Army Institute of Surgical Research, 2 U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, 3 University of Washington Background/Case Studies: Whole blood has been demonstrated to retain hemostatic activity, including platelet aggregation function, over at least 2 weeks of storage at 48C without agitation. It may be possible to extend the preservation of platelet function by agitating WB. In order to more fully characterize the quality of WB stored at 48C with or without agitation, we evaluated complement activation as a marker of inflammatory potential. Study Design/Method: Subjects donated one unit of WB collected in CPD-A2 (citrate phosphate dextrose anticoagulant with adenine). The WB was not leukoreduced nor was it separated into components. Units were stored under refrigerated conditions for 10, 12, 15, or 22 days after collection. Units were stored for 12 days without agitation. Units stored for 10, 15 or 22 days were agitated during storage with a Model 400 Hybridization Incubator at 48C set for end over end rotation at 2-3 rpms. At the appropriate time point, platelet free plasma was obtained from the WB sample and stored at -808C. The frozen plasma was analyzed by ELISA assays to determine: thrombinantithrombin complex (TAT) as a marker of coagulation; soluble CD40L as a measure of platelet activation and granule release; plasmin anti-plasmin complex (PAP) as a marker of fibrinolysis; plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) as another fibrinolytic measure; and complement activation markers C3a, C4d, C5a and C5b-9. Data was analyzed by one way repeated measure ANOVA. Results/Finding: Only 49 6 12% of the platelets were recovered in units stored for 12 days without agitation. These levels did not meet FDA requirements of 5.5 x 10 10 platelets per WB unit. Subsequently, WB was agitated and platelet recovery was 71-76%. No difference was seen in ELISA analysis for agitated or non-agitated samples. No change was seen in TAT or PAP levels between T0 (day of collection) and T10, 12, 15, or 22 measurements. Significant elevations of PAI-1 and sCD40L indicate activation of platelets and inhibition of fibrinolysis (p<0.001). Activated complement peptides C3a, C5a, and C4d were all elevated over time (p<0.001) while sC5d-9 was not. However, only C3a and C4d levels at T22 were above normal reference ranges at 1.30 and 1.41 times maximum reference, respectively. Conclusion: Whole blood agitation appeared necessary to recover platelets at or above FDA requirements. Whole blood stored at 48C for 10-22 days did show some activation of complement proteins. In contrast to studies in stored red blood cells with elevations of sC5d-9 reported, WB showed elevation of C3a, 5a and C4d and not sC5d-9. Complement was gradually and modestly activated with most levels remaining within reference ranges over whole blood shelf life.",

A minimum post-treatment dose of 3.0x10 11 or 6.0x10 11 was required to classify collections as singles or doubles respectively. Volume/dose mitigation (removal of volume to increase the number of products eligible for PR) was not utilized during this study.

Storing PLTs at cold temperature (4-6 o C [CT]) limits bacterial growth but results in rapid clearance upon transfusion. The development of alternate storage conditions usually involves costly radiolabeling human studies but success in these studies is difficult to predict based on in vitro studies. Thus, an animal model of PLT circulation that could predict performance of human PLTs in human volunteers would positively impact the development of alternate storage conditions. Study Design/Method: We designed an immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model to evaluate recovery of human PLTs and compared this side by side to a radiolabeling study in human volunteers that was conducted for evaluating a new PLT storage condition: thermocycling PLTs (11 hrs CT: 1 hr 37 o C [TC]). Autologous apheresis PLTs stored for 7-days at RT, TC and CT were radiolabeled and infused into healthy human volunteers (n59) and the same non-labeled PLTs were also infused into mice (n590). Blood samples from humans and mice were collected over time to generate survival and clearance curves of the PLTs in circulation. Flow cytometry was used to detect and analyze the human PLTs in the mouse samples to generate such curves; counts <5% were considered background. Results/Finding: The mean recoveries of infused PLTs were 51.2 6 16.7% for RT, 37.7 6 12.3% for TC and 23.1 6 8.8% for CT in humans. In mice, mean recoveries of the same PLTs were 24.9 6 10.3% for RT, 19.1 6 9.8% for CT and 16.2 6 6.9 for CT (mean6SD). To compare performance of the PLTs in humans and mice we expressed all recoveries as a percentage of the RT recoveries. In humans TC was $74% and CT was $45% of RT. In mice TC was $76% and CT was $64% of RT. The area under the survival curve (AUC) was calculated for the individual mouse study and human trial data sets. The results of both AUC were normalized to 100% for RT PLTs. Human TC PLTs had 26% AUC while CT PLTs had 11% AUC compared to RT PLTs in humans. In comparison, the same TC PLTs had 39% AUC and CT PLTs had 26% AUC of the RT AUC in the mice. The calculated ratios of the AUC between the TC PLTs and CT PLTs of the human data set and mouse model data set are 2.4 and 1.5, respectively. Conclusion: The SCID mouse model differentiates between RT PLTs and CT PLTs similar to humans based on AUC and PLT recovery data. However, the mouse model cannot differentiate between CT PLTs and TC PLTs as occurs in humans. Even though the mouse model cannot differentiate between CT PLTs and TC PLTs, it may still be a useful tool to screen other novel storage conditions for human PLTs.",

A study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of deglycerolizing this existing inventory on the closed cell processor and to evaluate how the change may impact post-thaw red blood cell (RBC) in vitro quality. As the closed cell processor uses a fixed centrifuge bowl for deglycerolization and RBC resuspension, both large and small units were assessed to determine the impact of cellular loss and variability in hematocrit on the post-thaw product. Study Design/Methods: 13 ABO/Rh matched LR SAGM RCCs were pooled and split to produce 6 large (354 mL) and 6 small (244 mL) RCCs. The RCCs were stored to 14 d and glycerolized manually by mixing 400 mL of glycerol with the RCC in a 2000 mL freezing bag. Units were frozen at -658C for ! 72 h before being removed from frozen storage and thawed in a 378C water bath. 3 large RCCs and 3 small RCCs were deglycerolized using the organization's current procedure on the COBE 2991 cell processor prior to re-suspension in 0.9% saline, 0.2% dextrose. The remaining RCCs were transferred into a 1L bag, spun to allow removal of excess glycerol by manual extraction to achieve a hematocrit of 75 6 5%, and deglycerolized in a 275 mL centrifuge bowl on the ACP-215 with re-suspension in AS-3. RBC quality was tested at 24 6 2 h post-deglycerolization. Results/Findings: Large RCCs had significantly higher hemoglobin per unit (COBE: p50.006, ACP215: p50.007) and lower cell recovery (COBE: p50.002, ACP215: p<0.001) post-deglycerolization than smaller RCCs on both cell processors. Large RCCs deglycerolized on the COBE 2991 had higher hemolysis (p<0.001) and supernatant potassium (p50.001) than did small volume RCCs. Large COBE 2991 RCCs had higher hematocrits (p50.033), hemoglobin (p50.006), and recovery (p50.001) than did large ACP-215 RCCs. However, all COBE 2991 RCCs had higher (p<0.001) hemolysis (0.99 6 0.24 %) levels than did ACP-215 RCCs (0.31 6 0.02 %). COBE 2991 RCCs failed to meet regulatory hemolysis standards of 0.8%. Conclusion: Addition of a 400 mL bolus dose of glycerol to RCCs of different volumes results in different concentrations of glycerol in the frozen RCC product and may lead to differences in frozen RCC quality. Additionally, the size of the RCC impacts quality for RCCs processed on the closed cell processor due to centrifuge bowl volume limitations which result in lower recovery, hemoglobin, and hematocrits. Use of the closed cell processor with resuspension in AS-3 and storage for 24 6 2 h, met in vitro quality standards for recovery, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and drastically reduced hemolysis levels in RCCs glycerolized manually. The ACP-215 cell processor can therefore be used to deglycerolize RCCs glycerolized using a manual, open system glycerolization method.",

Background/Case Studies: The possibility of transmitting infectious organisms via blood products, plasma and their derivatives is a major public health concern. While current screening measures have considerably improved transfusion safety by reducing the risks associated with known pathogens, they cannot protect from emerging infectious threats. The Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) represents a proactive strategy to further reduce transfusion-transmitted infectious risk. However, the scientific community broadly agrees over the fact that PRT has negative impacts on the product's quality markers. This study aims at evaluating the impacts of the Mirasol PRT on platelet (PLT) quality and PLT processing. Study Design/Method: Two ABO-compatible platelet concentrates (PCs) containing 100% plasma obtained from either apheresis or SAGM whole blood (WB)-derived processing were paired, pooled and then split into two equal units. One unit was used as a non-treated control (CTRL) (n56). Riboflavin was added to the other PC unit and then exposed to UV light according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Mirasol PRT (Teru-moBCT) (Test) (n56). Numerous in-vitro quality markers (PLT concentration, ATP, pO2, pCO2, pH, glucose, lactate, sodium, and potassium) were measured for both Mirasol-treated and non-treated PCs on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 for apheresis PCs, and on days 2, 3, 5 and 7 for WB-derived PCs.

The Mirasol treatment generates changes in pH, glucose and lactate for PCs during storage. Conclusion: The Mirasol treatment induces a loss in the net number of PLTs/unit and elevated platelet activation. Changes in pH, glucose and lactate suggest that PRT affects PLT metabolism.

Therefore, detecting various potential bacterial contaminants in platelets in a timely manner is critical. The BacTx assay is a rapid colorimetric assay that detects peptidoglycan, a cell wall component of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report an analysis of the BacTx assay at our hospital. Study Design/Method: We aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the BacTx assay. 340 intact leukoreduced apheresis PLT (LRAP) units were tested by BacTx at storage day 4. As a control, each intact LRAP was also cultured by an automated bacterial detection system (BacT culture) on storage day 3. The results of the BacTx test were compared to the results of the BacT culture system. Results/Finding: A total of 340 LRAP were tested. 335 LRAPs initially tested negative by BacTx, while 5 LRAPs initially tested positive by BacTx. All 5 initial positive BacTx tests were negative when subjected to repeat testing. In contrast, all LRAPs tested negative with the BacT culture system. The specificity of the BacTx test was 98.5%. We did not have any true positive test results; therefore, the sensitivity of the BacTx could not be determined.",

The objective was to demonstrate that in vitro quality measures are maintained for RBC when stored for >24 hours after treatment with an FDA approved rejuvenation solution. Study Design/Method: Whole blood (530-550 mL) was collected and processed at 3 sites into leukocyte-reduced RBC (a total of n563 CPD/ AS-1 and n564 CP2D/AS-3). 50 mL of rejuvenation solution (Citra Labs) was added to each RBC on Day 35 (D-35), incubated for 60 minutes with agitation at 378C water bath (Helmer DH4), washed (Haemonetics ACP215), and stored in AS-3 at 1-6 oC for 7 days (D-36 through D-42). In vitro recovery (%) was calculated and hemolysis, ATP, and 2,3-DPG were determined on Day 0, D-35, D-35 after rejuvenation and washing (postRJV), D-36, D-38, D-40, and D-42. All units were cultured on D-35 postRJV and on D-42, and then concentrated by centrifugation on D-42. Results/Finding: In vitro RBC recoveries were 95.7% and 95.5% (AS-1 and AS-3, respectively) and no bacterial growth was observed. Hemolysis on D-42 was maintained <1% in 58/63 (92%) AS-1 units and 63/64 (98.4%) AS-3 units. All AS-1 and AS-3 units (100%) had hemolysis <1% following concentration by centrifugation. Morphology score was reduced to 77% (AS-1) and 74% (AS-3) by D-35, restored after rejuvenation (91%, 92%, respectively) and maintained through D-42 (>90%). ATP was restored and maintained above fresh levels after rejuvenation. 2,3-DPG was restored above fresh levels and was maintained !80% of fresh levels through D-38. All values were significantly different compared to D-35 except as noted (p<0.001, paired ttest) ( Table 1) . Conclusion: Rejuvenation of stored RBC restores ATP and 2,3-DPG above fresh values and morphology to near fresh levels while maintaining improved in vitro RBC quality measures through D-42 when compared to nonrejuvenated RBC on D-35.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of combining liposomes and rejuvenation on the quality of stored RBCs. Study Design/Methods: Five leukoreduced packed RBC units obtained were pooled and split. The units produced were segregated into four experimental groups: sham control (S), liposome-treated (L), rejuvesol-treated (R) and liposome 1 rejuvesol-treated (L1R). The pRBCs were incubated for 1 h at 378C with HEPES-NaCl (sham), liposomes (DOPC:CHOL, 7:3 mol%, 2 mM lipid), Rejuvesol or liposomes plus Rejuvesol. The in vitro quality was accessed by hemolysis, deformability, aggregation, ATP and 2,3-DPG at day 42 HS. Results/Findings: Hemolysis was significantly decreased in all treatments compared to sham control (0.60 6 0.06%): L (0.53 6 0.01%, p50.042), R (0.43 6 0.02%, p50.004), L1R (0.48 6 0.06%, p50.020). Ektacytometry analysis showed an increase in maximum elongation (EI max ) in R (0.55 6 0.01, p50.010) and L1R (0.55 6 0.01, p50.010) treatments compared to S (0.53 6 0.01) but not L (0.53 6 0.01, p50.936). RBC rigidity (KEI) increased in all treatments compared to sham (1.19 6 0.07): L (1.28 6 0.06, p50.025), R (1.44 6 0.17, p50.010) and R1L (1.44 6 0.06, p50.004). Aggregation amplitude was significantly increased by R treatment only (24.07 6 1.67 au vs. 19.12 6 1.38 au, p50.004). ATP levels were significantly higher in all treatments compared to sham (1.64 6 0.14 mmol/g Hb): L (2.00 6 0.21 mmol/g Hb, p50.010), R (4.70 6 1.20 mmol/g Hb, p50.004), L1R (5.00 6 1.56 mmol/g Hb, p50.004). The levels of 2,3-DPG were no longer detectable in S and L treatments at day 42. The combined treatment was comparable to R (2.38 6 3.26 mmol/g Hb vs. 2.62 6 2.20 mmol/g Hb, p50.868). Conclusion: Both rejuvenation and liposome treatments improved the quality of stored RBCs compared to sham control. The combined treatment (L1R) did not have a greater impact in improving in vitro quality of stored RBCs compared to rejuvenation alone.",

In collaboration with the Institut de technologie des emballages et du genie alimentaire, our applied research group is working on the development and optimization of a transport packaging for the 500-mL whole blood Leukotrap RC System (Haemonetics Corp.). The objective is to design a packaging system for the rapid cooling (T < 108C) of one to six 500-mL whole blood units (WBU) within 8h from collection. Moreover, the insulating and thermoregulation system must maintain the internal temperature of WBU between 18C and 108C for 24h under extreme external conditions (-308C to 408C), including the initial blood cooling period. Study Design/Method: The proposed packaging design is based on an external Coroplast box containing six Vacuum Insulated Panels (VIP) for increased insulating efficiency. Preservation of the initial cooling period and extended thermoregulation properties were ensured by an assembly of preconditioned 58C Phase Change Material (PCM). The number of PCM, their position and conditioning were optimized and tested in order to meet the expected performance criteria. Preconditioned PCM were stored into VIP boxes for 24h at 20-248C before each test to mimic a worst-case scenario for remote blood drives. For the experimental testing, 500-mL WB bags were filled with 555 mL saline 0.9% at T 5 308C to mimic freshly collected WB. Probes were positioned inside the saline-filled bags to monitor temperature profiles of WBU under extreme winter (-308C) and summer (408C) conditions. Shipping boxes were filled with either one or six bags (n5 2). Results/Finding: The results showed that the thermoregulation box prototype is able to cool WBU bags under 108C in 4.55 6 0.62h and maintain their internal temperature between 18C and 108C for 24h with final values ranging between 6.38C and 9.38C for the extreme summer scenario. Similar results were obtained for the extreme winter scenario; units reached the 108C threshold value in 2.4 6 0.2h and the bags' internal temperatures were within the acceptable range for 24h. Conclusion: The insulating and thermoregulation system met HQ performance criteria. Preliminary results showed that PCM could be conditioned at temperatures higher than -138C without any significant impact on the system performances. HQ is currently validating the shipping box prototype performances. Additionally, we are working on reducing the PCM conditioning time to optimize logistic operations. As this packaging has many advantages in terms of durability, price and convenience, HQ intends to evaluate this system for the packaging and transport of other lines of blood products.",

Cohn 3 . 1 New York Blood Center, 2 Bonfils Blood Center, 3 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Background/Case Studies: Platelets collected and stored in platelet additive solution (PAS) reduce recipient exposure to donor plasma components. To better define the effects of PAS on platelet supernatant composition, we compared total protein, isohemagglutinin titers, HLA antibodies and in vitro neutrophil (PMN) priming activity in supernatants of PAS-C platelets to plasma platelets. Study Design/Methods: Apheresis platelets from group O blood donors were collected into either 100% donor plasma (n550) or 65% PAS-3 / 35% donor plasma (n550). Within 12 hours of collection, samples of the product supernatant were frozen, assayed for total protein concentration, anti-A and anti-B titer, and PMN priming activity within the total and lipid extractable fractions. All samples were screened for HLA antibodies. Screen-positive samples were tested using Luminex single bead assays for antibody strength and specificity. Soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) was measured using solid-phase ELISA. Results/Findings: Supernatants of PAS-C platelets had significantly lower total protein concentration, anti-A and anti-B titers compared to plasma platelets. There was no significant difference in the number of HLA-antibody screen positive PAS-C (3/50 products) compared to plasma platelets (2/50 products); however, the HLA-antibody screen-positive supernatants of PAS-86A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 ABSTRACT C platelets had fewer HLA specificities (2 specificities) compared to those of the plasma platelets (18 specificities). PMN priming activity was significantly increased in the supernatant of PAS-C platelets. The lipid extractable fraction was not affected; however sCD40L levels were increased in the supernatant of PAS-C compared to plasma platelets (Table 1) . Conclusion: Decreased plasma proteins likely underlie lower rates of allergic and febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions seen with use of PAS-C platelets. Decreased anti-A and anti-B titers may prevent hemolysis from minor ABO mismatch. Lower HLA-antibody specificities may mitigate transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). Increased PMN priming by PAS-C platelets is likely due to platelet membrane release of sCD40L and not bioactive lipids. Although sCD40L has been associated with TRALI, only PMN priming with lipid -not cytokine -agents has been causally linked with TRALI. The mechanism and clinical impact of increased sCD40L in PAS-C platelets remain to be elucidated. Background/Case Studies: Current guidelines require a reduction of residual white blood cells (rWBC) below 5x10 6 WBC in US and 1x10 6 WBC in Europe, per unit. The established reference method for testing rWBC in platelet (PLT) and red blood cell (RBC) products is flow cytometry. Alternative technologies have been developed including hemocytometry and microfluorometry. Study Design/Methods: This study compared performance and workflow efficiency of the FACSVia, a flow cytometer with a simplified workflow and automated loader to the ADAM automatic microscopic cell counter based on imaging technology. Nonfiltered whole blood (WB) samples, apheresis platelet units (n52) and leukoreduced (LR) RBC units (n52) were used to generate spiked samples. Apheresis platelets and LR RBC were filtered to deplete WBCs and were used as a diluent. Nonfiltered WB samples were the source of WBCs to prepare a sample of 1000 WBC/uL. The spiked samples of 5, 12.5, 5, 25, 50 and 100 WBC/uL were prepared from the source sample of 1000 WBC/uL and filtered platelet and RBC units. To evaluate linearity, WBC concentrations (0, 12.5, 5, 25, 50, 100 WBC/uL) were measured using ADAM and FACSVia. Samples were stained and run in triplicate on each analyzer. Data was analyzed using linear regression. The results were proportional to the WBC concentration in the spiked samples. Reproducibility of the two systems was measured by running spiked samples (0, 5, 25, 50 WBC/uL). 10 tubes of each sample were stained and run per system. The %CV and %Diff were calculated. A batch of 20 samples (PLT and RBC) were run on both analyzers, repeated for 5 days. Workflow efficiency was assessed observationally by measuring the time of tasks performed. Tasks recorded were Instrument QC, assay controls and sample testing and analysis. Results/Findings: The WBC concentration results for PLT and RBC samples on FACSVia correlated well with ADAM (r-PLT50.996, slope50.972), (r-RBC50.999, slope50.992). The %Diff-PLT at 5, 25, 50 WBC/uL were 7.8, 4.7 and 10, respectively. The %Diff-RBC at 5, 25, 50 WBC/uL were 10.8, 3.2 and 14.7, respectively. The average total testing time was similar on both instruments; 89 min for the FACSVia and 92 min for the ADAM. Of the total testing time, ADAM required continuous hands-on time, while FACSVia demonstrated 62% (56 of 89 min) hands-off time. Conclusion: Both instruments showed comparable precision, linearity and accuracy. While the average total testing time was similar on both instruments, FACSVia offered a significant workflow efficiency advantage. Users saved an average hands-on time of 56 minutes that could be used on other tasks.",

Cohn* 1 and Mickey Koh 2 . 1 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, 2 St George's Hospital and Medical School Background/Case Studies: Autologous Platelet-rich plasma (aPRP) is a poorly regulated blood component often produced at the patient's bedside and used for indications such as chronic and acute orthopedic injuries, wound and incision-healing and rheumatologic diseases. PRP isolation can be done by apheresis, which yields a consistent, platelet-rich fraction; however, most aPRP is made using small bench-top centrifuges with cartridges that deliver uneven platelet enrichment. Thus, the consistency and quality of aPRP is questionable and the lower yielding PRP may have decreased efficacy. Study Design/Methods: A survey was designed to assess aPRP manufacture, usage and quality control (QC) measures taken prior to its use. A survey was developed with input from content experts. The survey was sent to members of BEST and ISBT. Survey respondents were encouraged to forward the survey to colleagues, thus a true denominator is unknown. A total of 62 completed and partially completed surveys were received. Results/Findings: Responses came from 13 countries, but the majority of responses came from the United States (US). Of the respondents, 35% reported aPRP use in their hospital. aPRP was used predominantly for outpatients, though >40% of hospitals also used aPRP in the in-patient setting. In most hospitals, aPRP was used by 1-5 MDs; however, 3 hospitals had >10 MDs using aPRP. The aPRP was used for orthopedics, wound/incision repair, rheumatology and other indications. In the US the aPRP was manufactured outside of the blood bank, while outside the US aPRP was isolated by blood bank personnel. Nearly all the aPRP manufacturing was done with no quality control (QC) measures (97%); however, 3 respondents assessed the final product prior to release. These QC measures included a platelet count to measure the enrichment of the platelet fraction, culturing the product and infectious serology testing. In some cases, if the aPRP failed QC it could still be used, pending an MD's approval. In the 3 hospitals conducting QC on the final aPRP, the testing was done by the blood bank. A subset of respondents from African nations also used allogeneic PRP (allPRP). In contrast to the patterns of use with aPRP, allPRP was used primarily for inpatients for indications including orthopedics, wound/incision repair and 'other'. The allPRP was manufactured in the blood bank or the donor center with no QC other than a regular check of the centrifuge used to isolate the PRP fraction. Conclusion: PRP is used in hospitals throughout the world for a wide variety of indications. The blood bank is involved in its manufacture in some countries, but in the US aPRP is made outside of the blood bank. Quality control of aPRP production and the final product is not done in most hospitals. To improve the consistency and efficacy of PRP, more stringent QC measures need to be in place. Background/Case Studies: The morphology of donated red blood cells (RBC) change with storage, along with a loss of deformability, increased surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), and decreased intracellular ATP. These changes have been associated with increased RBC clearance within hours of transfusion. Analysis of morphological alterations of stored RBC with imaging flow cytometry (IFC) has identified a subpopulation of small RBC that accumulates upon storage. This RBC subpopulation has a reduced projected surface area and undergoes a spherocytic shift which is expected to induce their retention in the spleen (Roussel, Dussiot et al, 2017) . Some of the storage alterations are reversible when the RBC metabolism is reestablished. As such, treatment with a rejuvenation solution (Citra Labs) before transfusion is expected to restore some of the RBC properties and thus potentially increase their capacity to stay in circulation and operate effective tissue oxygenation following transfusion. Study Design/Methods: A multi-parametric analysis of RBC alterations was performed to evaluate the effect of rejuvenation on RBCs stored in SAGM (n56) under blood bank conditions at Day 3 (D3), at Day 42 (D42), after rejuvenation (R), and after rejuvenation and washing (RW). Morphological alterations of stored RBCs were evaluated with IFC (Imagestream X Mark II, AMNIS V R ). Results/Finding: Rejuvenation increased the level of intracellular ATP, confirming the metabolic effect of this process. Population distribution as per RBC projected surface area measured by IFC depicted a well-demarcated subpopulation of small RBC that increased with storage from 2.1-8.8% at D3 to 8.3-68.1% at D42. Rejuvenation markedly reduced this storage-induced spherocytic shift (1.7-29.3%) and partially restored RBC morphology, an effect confirmed by differential interference contrast microscopy. The restoration effect of the rejuvenation process did not correct the storage-related loss of RBC elongation but was associated with a decrease in PS exposure (Table) . Conclusion: Our multi-parametric analysis shows that some but not all storage-related alterations are therefore corrected by metabolic rejuvenation. The impact of these effects while generally positive at the cellular scale requires further analysis by specific clinical studies assessing transfusion yield and tissue oxygenation.",

Acker* 2,3 . 1 Canadian Blood Services, Centre for Innovation, 2 Canadian Blood Services, 3 University of Alberta Background/Case Studies: The blood service uses both top/top with whole blood filtration (WBF) and top/bottom with red cell filtration (RCF) methods to prepare CPD/SAGM LR red cell concentrates (RCCs). Mean volume (mL) is higher in WBF units (314 6 15) than in RCF units (275 6 16), with similar hematocrits. A closed system cell processor is currently being implemented for cryopreservation of RCCs. Post-deglycerolization re-suspension in AS-3 additive solution is performed on-instrument to a defined total end volume, as dictated by the centrifuge bowl size. The impact of the resulting variation in hematocrit on post-thaw in vitroRBC quality was evaluated to ensure that regulatory standards can still be met for RCCs at the extreme edge of the input volume range. Study Design/Methods: 12 small RCF (252-263 mL) and 12 large WBF (322-353 mL) RCCs were stored for 21 d before being glycerolized and frozen at -658C for !72 h. Large RCCs whose red cell mass exceeded the capacity of the 275 mL deglycerolization centrifuge bowl were volume reduced prior to glycerolization. RCCs were thawed in a 378C water bath, deglycerolized and re-suspended in AS-3. RCCs were stored 14 d and then tested for in vitroRBC quality. Results/Finding: Small RCF RCCs had lower (p<0.05) hematocrit, specific gravity, hemoglobin per unit, supernatant K 1 and Na 1 concentration, deformability (EI MAX ), and higher (p<0.001) recovery than did large WBF units. No significant differences in hemolysis, ATP, 2,3-DPG, p50, RBC indices, RBC morphology, or residual glycerol were seen between groups. The majority of units met acceptance criteria (Table 1) , however 8 of 12 large WBF units had RBC recoveries < 80% due to pre-glycerolization volume reduction, and 2 of the small RCF units had hemoglobin values < 35 g per unit. When the recovery and hemoglobin failure rates are analyzed against the organization's RCC production volume distribution, the mean recovery is projected to be well above 80% and the hemoglobin failure rate would be below 10% of units tested; compliant with regulatory standards. Conclusion: The differences between groups in the cryopreserved RCC physical characteristics were expected due to the re-suspension method and differences in the input product red cell mass. The lack of significant metabolic differences between groups indicates that the differences in postdeglycerolization hematocrits are not adversely affecting product quality. 0.03 6 .02 0.33 6 .28 0.83 6 .3 0.32 6 .14 Elongation index (30Pa) 0.602 6 .008 0.585 6 .017 0.580 6 .017 0.578 6 .017",

Study Design/Method: Oxygen dissociation curves (ODC) (Hemox Analyzer, TCS Scientific) were generated from fifty-two (52) RBC units (leukocyte-reduced), CPD/AS-1 or CP2D/AS-3, on Day 0, Day 42, and after rejuvenation and washing (PW). The ODC for each sample was used to determine ORC (mL O 2 /g Hb) and Total Releasable Oxygen (TRO) of the unit (mL O 2 ). ORC was determined by assessing the change in % O 2 saturation from 100 mm Hg PO 2 (e.g., lung) to 40 mm Hg PO 2 (e.g., venous blood) multiplied by 1.34 mL O 2 /g Hb (Li 2016). A simulated baseline pretransfusion VO 2 of 115 mL O 2 /min was estimated using the Day 0 ORC and assuming a 7 g/dL transfusion trigger with a cardiac output of 5 L/min and 5 L blood volume. Paired Student's t tests were used for comparative statistical analyses. Results/Finding: RBC rejuvenation on day 42 restored ORC and TRO to levels greater than Day 0 ( Table 1) . ORC of the rejuvenated unit was 1.5 6 0.2 times and 3.4 6 0.5 times greater than RBC on Day 0 and Day 42, respectively (p<0.001). VO 2 increased after a simulated single unit transfusion of RBC (Day 0, Day 42, and PW) by 19.3%, 8.9%, and 28.8% over the pre transfusion VO 2 , respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: These results suggest a transfusion with rejuvenated RBCs has the potential to release 3.3 times the volume of O 2 compared to standard, untreated RBCs stored for 42 days. Inferior oxygen delivery to tissues (VO 2 max) has been observed during exercise in healthy human volunteers after transfusion of two autologous RBC units stored for 42 days vs 7 days which seem dependent on genetic variability and storage time (Bennett-Guerrero 2017). Therefore, transfusion practices to correct anemia may be less effective than intended due to the variable ORC of standard stored RBC units. Transfusion strategies should consider whether the use of RBC with increased ORC may be physiologically advantageous. Disclosure: This study was funded by Zimmer Biomet.",

            "text": "These include altered membrane composition and decreased deformability, increased in-bag and post-transfusion hemolysis, loss of ATP, Snitrosohemoglobin, vasodilatory capacity, and cell surface PS expression, and depleted 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). The loss of 2,3-DPG increases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, resulting in lower p50 (partial pressure of oxygen at 50% hemoglobin saturation). Decreased p50 may negatively impact the ability for transfused RBCs to release oxygen to peripheral tissues. An FDA-approved rejuvenation solution (Citra Labs) can restore normal levels of ATP and 2,3-DPG, normalizing membrane function and oxygen affinity, respectively. This process requires incubation at 378C for an hour, an impractical step in time-sensitive situations, followed by washing of the RBCs. We tested the hypothesis that rejuvenation without the incubation step (\"cold rejuvenation\") could prevent or reverse changes in oxygen affinity, deformability, and susceptibility to hemolysis of RBCs. Study Design/Method: Eight units of group A1, leukoreduced PRBC stored in AS-1 were obtained from our local blood center. After 3 days of storage, units were divided into 4 separate aliquots: control (CTL), wash (W), standard rejuvenation (SR), and cold rejuvenation (CR). The rejuvenation solution (50ml) was added to the CR group, and all groups were then stored for another 12 days at 1-68C. On day 15 of storage, the SR group was incubated for 1 hour at 378C with rejuvenation solution, after which the W, SR, and CR groups were separately washed on a C.A.T.S V R (Fresenius Kabi) using the High Quality Wash setting. Hemoglobin p50 was measured by tonometry using a Hemox Analyzer (TCS Scientific). Deformability (Elongation Index or EI) was measured by ektacytometry (LoRRca Mechatronics). Supernatant plasma free hemoglobin (PFHb) was measured using visiblelight spectrophotometry. Cell surface PS expression (PS1) was measured by Annexin V flow cytometry. All group results were compared using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with a 5 0.05. Results/Finding: Significant differences in p50 were noticed between all groups (Table 1) . EI, PS1, and PFHb did not differ between groups. Conclusion: Cold rejuvenation prevents the increased oxygen affinity (lower p50) seen over 15 days of RBC storage without adverse effects on deformability or hemolysis. This offers an alternative to incubated rejuvenation to provide clinicians with ready access to RBCs with a high/normal p50 that may better release oxygen to the tissues. cause transient and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias upon transfusion, particularly in infants, and massively-transfused patients, and those with compromised renal function. Reactive antibodies and other inflammatory agents in RBCs can also elicit life-threatening reactions, potentially causing high fever, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), anaphylaxis, and even death. In this study, a multifunctional bead-based filter was evaluated for removal of K 1 , along with free hemoglobin (Hb) and other pRBC contaminants that can contribute to transfusion related adverse events. Study Design/Method: Ten leukocyte-reduced pRBC (300mL) units stored in AS-1, obtained from a regional blood donor center at expiration (42 6 2 days), were passed by gravity through sorbent-devices containing 50 mL of multifunctional polymer bead, at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. Supernatants were analyzed for K 1 removal as well as free Hb, antibodies and cytokines (27-plex, BioRad). RBCs were analyzed for viability and integrity via flow cytometry and osmotic fragility assay, respectively. Results/Finding: Filtration of the aged pRBC units through the sorbent device reduced [K 1 ] from 54.2 6 5.0 to 1.98 6 1.3 mEq/L; equivalent to an 84.6% reduction. Free Hb was reduced by 96.3% from 2.5 6 1.0 to 0.39 6 0.2 mg/mL. Antibodies, specifically IgG, IgA, and IgM decreased from 9.91 6 3.1 to 2.40 6 1.1 mg/mL (77.7%), 0.48 6 0.1 to 0.25 6 0.01 mg/mL (48.9%), and 0.73 6 0.2 to 0.49 6 0.1 mg/mL (31.5%), respectively. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced, specifically: IP-10 from 144.27 6 16.2 to 18.43 6 2.7 pg/mL (87.2%), MIP-1b from 37.37 6 5.7 to 7.23 6 2.5 pg/mL (80.7%), and PDGF from 1348.3 6 291.9 to 77.91 6 22 pg/mL (94.2%). Filtration had no significant impact on cell surface markers of RBC viability (<0.1% decrease) or sensitivity to osmotic changes. Values listed represent mean 6 SEM (P < 0.01 for all analytes tested). A paired ttest was used to assess significance. Conclusion: The sorbent filter was highly effective in reducing the levels of extracellular K 1 as well as free Hb, antibodies, and cytokines from pRBCs without impact on RBC viability or integrity. This study demonstrates the viability of a multifunctional sorbent filter for removal of K 1 along with other detrimental components from stored pRBCs that can readily be incorporated into transfusion practices to minimize adverse effects. Background/Case Studies: Platelets carry no Rh antigens, but residual red blood cell (RBC) in platelet products can immunize D negative recipients if the donor is D positive. Current recommendation is to give Rh immunoglobulin (RhIG) to Rh negative patient if they receive Rh positive platelet unit to avoid potential alloimmunization to D antigen. A recent study has shown a very low frequency (1.5%) of D alloimmunization when a Rh mismatch platelet is transfused. Restricting D negative patients to receive only D negative platelets could create shortage and cause inventory challenges. Higher yields of platelets with minimum to none residual RBCs are obtained with new generations of apheresis machines. As a consequence, the need for prophylactic Rh immunoglobulin (RhIG) may be unnecessary with the use of apheresis derived platelets. The accurate determination of residual RBC in a platelet unit is important for patient safety to prevent Rh alloimmunization.",

ABSTRACT collection) RBCs to RBCs stored for 42 days and after treatment with an FDA approved rejuvenation solution. Study Design/Method: The addition of a rejuvenation solution to stored Red Blood Cells (RBCs) has been shown to increase ATP and 2,3-DPG profiles to fresh levels. The objective was to compare 50% hemoglobin-oxygen saturation (p50) and morphology profiles of fresh(day of collection) RBCs to RBCs stored for 42 days and after treatment with an FDA approved rejuvenation solution. Results/Finding: In vitro RBC recovery (overall) was 97.2 6 2.2%. Hemolysis (%) was similar on Day 42 before and after dry-air incubation with the rejuvenation solution (0.34 6 0.14% vs 0.35 6 0.14%). Percent hemolysis (%) decreased after washing (0.24 6 0.07%) and was maintained below <1% for all units during storage for 24Hr (0.51 6 0.19%). Average ATP and 2,3-DPG were restored above the average fresh values. The morphology score decreased $25% by Day 42, which was restored to near fresh values following rejuvenation and washing and storage 24Hr (93.7% and 95.1%, respectively). RBC oxygen affinity, as assessed by p50, was restored above fresh values. All values were significantly different compared to Day 42 (p<0.001, paired t-test) ( Table 1) . Conclusion: RBC morphology was restored to near fresh and average ATP, 2,3-DPG, and p50 were restored above fresh values when incubated with a rejuvenation solution using the dry-air incubation process. RBC Morphology, ATP and 2,3-DPG were maintained during storage 24Hr. Rejuvenation of refrigerated RBCs may offer avenues to improve RBC quality prior to transfusion.",

Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Background/Case Studies: Blood donors are screened with a donor history questionnaire that includes questions regarding behavioral risk factors, but none that specifically screen for the use of marijuana. Therefore, there is the theoretical possibility of transfer of active cannabis metabolites through transfusion. Donor plasma collected at an urban, hospital-based blood donor center was examined for the presence of active cannabis metabolites, D9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-OH-D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC). Study Design/Method: De-identified donor plasma segments were sequestered and stored frozen until time of testing. Testing for THC and 11-OH-THC was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based on a method modified from Lacroix and Saussereau. In summary, this method used dabsyl chloride derivatization of THC and 11-OH-THC to produce samples for LC-MS/MS analysis. LC used a C18 column. Post-column detection by MS/MS used positive ion electrospray with Q1:Q3 ion pairs of m/z 5 605.3:225.3 (internal standard (IS), d3-THC), m/ z 5 602.2:225.2 (THC), and m/z 5 618.3:256.1 (11-OH-THC). Quantitative results for THC and 11-OH-THC were obtained from a standard curve (ratio of analyte integrals to integrals of internal standard) ranging from 0-50 ng/ mL for both THC and 11-OH-THC. Limits of quantitation, defined as 5 standard deviations above background, were 0.7 ng/mL for THC and 7 ng/mL for 11-OH-THC. Results/Finding: A total of 424 donor plasma samples were tested for THC and 11-OH-THC. No samples tested positive for either THC or 11-OH-THC. Theoretical calculations according to statistics of a Poisson distribution indicated that there would be a 50% probability of one or more positives at a prevalence of 0.16% positive samples, and a 95% probability of one or more positives at a prevalence of 0.71% positive samples. Results thus indicated a boundary of prevalence of the presence of active THC-metabolites in plasma samples to be less than 1% among this donor population. Standard pharmacokinetics of cannabis metabolism in previous studies indicate a likely time window of less than 12 hours for post-exposure detection of THC and/or 11-OH-THC in plasma. Conclusion: Testing of 424 donor plasma samples for active metabolites of cannabis at one urban, hospital-based blood donor center produced no testpositives. Statistically, results indicated that prevalence of positivity, if greater than zero, is at most less than 1%. Probability of occurrence of cannabis metabolites in blood donor samples is likely to be highly variable across donor centers and is largely dependent on blood donor demographics.",

Current studies are limited by the lack of quality measures suitable for routine screening of RCC. Based on evidence that fragments called microparticles (MP) or extracellular vesicles are markers of cellular activation or degradation, this study investigated the utility of MP screening to characterize the effect of RCC production methods and storage. Study Design/Method: Red blood cell concentrates were prepared by whole blood filtration (WBF; Top/Top) or red cell filtration (RCF; Top/Bottom) methods, centrifuged to prepare a supernatant and tested for MP content (as measured with dynamic light scattering or a tunable resistive pulse sensing technique), hemolysis, ATP and red cell deformability on days 7, 21, and 42 of storage. One RCF RCC was tested on days 1, 5, 14, 21, and 43 and six 10 mL aliquots were stored in parallel and tested on days 14, 21, and 43. All samples were tested for MP Content and compared to the other quality indicators. Results/Finding: MP Content showed a linear increase with storage time with statistically significant differences between days 14, 21 and 43 (p<0.001) and correlated with supernatant hemoglobin, and inversely with ATP or RBC elasticity. Both MP testing methods agreed with respect to total MP Content. Starting levels of the quality indicators varied between donations, preparation methods (WBF RCC contained much higher levels of MP), and storage time. MP Content in the 6 aliquots were consistent at each time point but statistically higher than in the original RCC on and after day 21 of storage. Conclusion: MP Content correlates with measures of hemolysis and other RBC quality indicators and could be implemented as a routine screening tool. Differences in MP content between donors, processes and age could be monitored and used to inform component production decisions. Measuring MP Content would allow 100% screening of RCC products in studies and pragmatic QC initiatives which are needed to settle the controversy about the clinical effect of RCC age.",

Velico Medical Inc Background/Case Studies: Frozen plasma is integral to hemostasis management in many situations but logistically cumbersome because of frozen storage and long thawing time. Spray-dried plasma (ODP, On Demand Plasma) is potentially superior because it may be stored under refrigeration near the patient and reconstituted in minutes at the point-of-care. The objective of this study is to determine if ODP can be consistently manufactured at a blood center with key proteins and coagulation function comparable to FFP. Study Design/Methods: Units of never frozen plasma collected at a blood center were processed on-site at a fixed volume into ODP using Velico's spray dryer. ODP (n 5 60) and paired FFP aliquots were stored for 31-33 days at 2-68C and -188C, respectively, reconstituted with a fixed volume of rehydration fluid (sterile water for injection), and extensively characterized with respect to the levels of hemostatic proteins, coagulation and complement activation markers, and clotting performance. The volumes of processed plasma and rehydration fluid were pre-determined ensuring similar total protein concentration in reconstituted ODP and FFP for direct comparison. Results/Findings: Compared to FFP, ODP had ! 80% levels of functional clotting factors (fibrinogen, factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII), plasminogen, and protease inhibitors (antithrombin III, protein C, protein S; plasmin, C1 esterase and alpha 1-proteniase inhibitors). The level of factor XIII in ODP was slightly lower, about 70% of FFP by both activity and antigen assays. ODP was identical to FFP in the levels of albumin, immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM), lipoproteins, calcium, citrate, and coagulation proteins evaluated by antigen assays except for factor XIII. The levels of the markers for coagulation (thrombin-antithrombin, prothrombin fragments I1II and Ddimer) and complement (C3a and C5a) activation in ODP remained similar to FFP. ODP was equivalent to FFP when assessed by aPTT, PT and thrombelastography.",

            "text": "TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 ABSTRACT Spray-drying fragmented a substantial number of high molecular weight von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers into smaller ones, leading to a net increase of vWF multimers in ODP. The size re-distribution reduced the vWF ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo) to 62% in ODP relative to FFP, but had no impact on vWF antigen and factor VIII function (stabilized by vWF). vWF-specific studies have shown that ODP retains hemostatic function in supporting platelet adhesion and aggregation (see abstracts by Meledeo et al/US Army Institute of Surgical Research and Bercovitz et al/Blood Center of Wisconsin). Conclusion: ODP can be manufactured at a blood center with a quality comparable to that of FFP. Future studies will determine if the product is bioequivalent to FFP and comparable in safety and efficacy. Background/Case Studies: The collection time of whole blood is, according to European Guidelines, limited to 15 minutes. In addition, donations with collection times between 12 and 15 minutes should not be used for preparation of platelet (PLT) concentrates (PC) because of the chance of too much activation of PLT. It seems justified to re-evaluate the quality of PLT from these donations because new generations collection systems and mixers were introduced, including a more efficient needle. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro quality of PC prepared from 12-15 minutes buffy coats (BC) with the aim to prevent unnecessary discarding of BC and to simplify the total blood bank process. Study Design/Method: Single-donor PC (sPC, n56) were prepared from one 12-15 minutes BC and 60 mL of autologous plasma in a 600 mL PVC-DEHP container. As a reference, sPC from donations with collection times of <12 minutes were prepared (n55). In addition, PC were prepared from 5 BC, of which at least 4 BC were from 12-15 minutes donations (n55). After pooling of the BC, 300 mL of PAS-E was added and a standard pooling set with a PVC-BTHC storage container was used for storage of PC. All PC were stored for 8 days at 22 6 28C and sampled at regular intervals for determination of the in vitro quality. Aggregation tests were performed with Chronolog (ADP or collagen) and Multiplate (arachidonic acid) aggregometers. Thromboelastography (TEG), using kaolin as an activator, was applied for assessment of the overall clotting capacity. Values are expressed as mean6 SD. A non-paired t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test was applied for statistical analyses of normal or non-normal distributed data respectively. Results/Finding: Volume (67 6 5 vs. 66 6 16 mL) and platelet content (74 6 11 vs. 71 6 15 x10 9 ) were similar in both groups. At the end of storage, both groups showed comparable in vitro quality (Day 8, pH(378C): 6.84 6 0.16 vs 6.83 6 0.17, other data not shown). No differences in aggregation response after stimulation with arachidonic acid, ADP or collagen were measured. TEG parameters in both groups were also comparable. The five-donor PC fulfilled all requirements of European Guidelines, aside from occurrence of small aggregates at Day 6 and/or 8 in 2/5 PC (possibly because sometimes AB0 incompatibility was accepted). On Day 8, PLT showed low CD62P expression (17.1 6 1.8%) and phosphatidylserine exposure (Annexin V binding, 8.9 6 1.9%). Hypotonic shock response of platelets was comparable with historical data. Conclusion: Single-PC in plasma as well as five-donor PC in PAS-E, prepared from 12-15 minutes whole blood donations had a normal composition and showed good in vitro quality during 8 day storage. To substantiate that the exclusion of 12-15 minutes donations for PC preparation could be stopped, further studies will be performed.",

The purpose of these systems is to transport products and specimens, resulting in reduced turnaround time for laboratory testing and to aid in the timely delivery of patient care. A downfall of PTSs is that they have the potential to play a role in increased hemolysis. While several studies have been published on the effects of PTSs on blood specimens, there are very few that address the effects on blood products, specifically red blood cells (RBC). The objective of this study was twofold: to determine if the PTS that is in use at our facility contributes to an increase in hemolysis of RBC units and to evaluate how the PTS system affects red cell microparticle (RMP) levels. Study Design/Method: Forty-one units of AS-3 RBCs, 20 irradiated and 21 non-irradiated, were selected for the study. The units varied in age, ranging from 2 to 42 days old. Specimens were obtained from each unit both prior to and after being transported through the PTS, which runs underground and spans the length of a mile and a half. Specimens were spun down and the plasma supernatant was removed. All specimens were evaluated for plasma hemoglobin (hgb), potassium (K), hemolysis index (HI), and RMPs. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and p value were used to compare the pre and post values. Additional statistical analysis was performed to compare the values after adjusting for age and irradiation. Results/Finding: After sending the RBC units through the PTS, hgb, HI, and RMPs were statistically (p< 0.05) higher than before. When adjusted for irradiation, the same analytes remained statistically higher, however when adjusted for age, the p-value was only significant for hgb and HI. The K values did not significantly change. RMPs significantly increased, but only if the units were irradiated (p50.02). (Table) Conclusion: The use of a PTS provides an effective means to transport blood products; however, it can contribute to biological changes within RBC units. It is uncertain at this time how those changes can affect the outcome of patients who receive these products. Each PTS system is different in its specifications and should be validated prior to being used to transport blood products.",

            "text": "Validation of Factor VIII Levels of Thawed Fresh Frozen Plasma after 5 Days of Storage Pei Lun Karen Lim* 1 , Erma Sofia Sumardi 1 , Isamar Eduardo Ancheta 1 , Susan Lim 2 , Christina Yip 1 , Lip Kun Tan 2 and Shir Ying Lee 3 . 1 National University Hospital Singapore, 2 National University Hospital, 3 National University Hospital, Singapore Background/Case Studies: Plasma transfusion is indicated in patients with coagulation factor deficiencies and active bleeding, or who are about to undergo an invasive procedure. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) has to be placed in the freezer within 8 hours of processing and stored at -188C or colder in order to preserve its coagulation factors. Thawed FFP has an expiration period of 24 hours hence to reduce wastage, this study aims to investigate Factor VIII (FVIII) activity in thawed plasma stored for 5 days and kept at 1 to 68C. FVIII was chosen as it is an important coagulation factor in correcting coagulopathies. Arbitrary FVIII level acceptance limit was set as not less than 50 IU/dL. Study Design/Method: Randomly selected units of FFP (n510) were measured for FVIII concentration based on clotting assay (STAV R -DEFICIENT 92A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 VIII Diagnostica Stago). FVIII levels were measured at five time points: prefreezing, 0, 24, 72 and 120 hours post-thawing. FFP were thawed using Helmer Plasma Thawer (Helmer Scientific) at 30 to 378C for 35 minutes. An aliquot of thawed FFP from each unit was removed and measured for FVIII before refrigeration (0 hours post-thaw). Thawed plasma (TP) units were kept in a refrigerator at 1 to 68C for 5 days for subsequent testing. Results/Finding: Results obtained were listed in Table 1 . Units 7 to 9 were not tested for FVIII at post thaw-24 hour due to operational issues. The overall FVIII concentration decreased at an average of 13% from pre-freezing to post thaw 0 hour. After further storage of TP post thaw-24 hour and -72 hour, residual FVIII level remain to be above 50 IU/dL except unit 10 which had a lower initial FVIII concentration. At post thaw-120 hour, 7 out of 10 units tested had residual FVIII activity within the pre-set standard of 50 IU/ dL. The average decline from 0-hour post-thaw to 24-hour, 72-hour and 120hour post-thaw was 36.5%, 42.7% and 47.9% respectively. There was no observed trend of any blood group having higher or lower pre-freezing FVIII and this is likely due to small sample size. Conclusion: Decrease of coagulation factor such as FVIII in FFP is expected due to its diminishing stability. Nevertheless, our data showed that majority of the TP retained at least 50 IU/dL of FVIII. Typically patients with factor levels below 30 IU/dL may start to show abnormal coagulation profile. While TP is not used for specific factor replacement therapy, it may be indicated for patients with general coagulopathies and active bleeding. Further study extending to measurement of other labile factor such as FV may add value to the validation study.",

While for a limited number of these pathogens TTI risk can be reduced using blood screening assays, alternative solutions are anticipated. Pathogen reduction (PR) technology was identified as a potential solution. Validation of amotosalen/UVA photochemical treatment in our blood center was performed by comparing the platelet component (PC) quality of the standard \"control\" single-donor PRP-concentrate in 100% plasma over a 5 day storage period and the new \"test\" pathogen-reduced, pooled (pools of 5) PRP PC in 100% plasma over a 7 day storage period.

The test PCs were pathogen-reduced with the INTERCEPT Blood System (Cerus Corporation, Concord, U.S.A.) at day 0; the process was completed by day 1 post-collection. Samples were taken daily for quality analysis from test and control PC until day 5 and day 7, respectively. For bacterial spiking, additional PC were spiked with each receiving 4 mL of 1 McFarland ($ 1.2x10 9 CFU) S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa or S. viridans, respectively, to challenge PR efficacy. Results/Finding: The average platelet loss in the test PC post PR treatment was 4.7% 6 2.0, the total average platelet loss at day 7 was 11.2% 62.8. The average platelet loss in the control units at day 5 was 9.5% 61.4. The average pH of the test units at day 7 was 6.64 60.04 and in the same range as the control PC, pH 5 6.89 60.09. Glucose concentration in test PC at day 7 (13.8 63.0 mmol/L) was lower than in the day 5 control units (18.32 61.06 mmol/L). Lactate levels increased during the course of storage; lactate levels at days 5 and 7 were outside the range of the assay (>15 mmol/L). Cultures inoculated with pathogen reduced, bacterially spiked units were negative after 7 days of incubation, in contrast to those inoculated with nonpathogen reduced samples from the control units, which were positive for bacterial growth. Conclusion: The quality parameters of the pathogen reduced test PC were within specifications and comparable to the conventional control PC. The high efficacy of bacterial inactivation together with comparable quality parameter values suggests the use of amotosalen/UVA pathogen reduction is safe and efficient to enhance PC transfusion safety.",

A tissue factor-activated test on the ROTEMV R delta hemostasis analyzer (EXTEM) was performed on each condition. For each source, dose-response curves for clotting time (CT), alpha angle, and maximum clot formation (MCF) were generated using linear regression models. Inter-source unit variability was determined by ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc analysis (RStudio Inc.). Results/Finding: LC-MS/MS identified 256 proteins in cryo; of the 10 most abundant, only fibrinogen was relevant to coagulation. Notably, the American Red Cross (ARC) single donor source had the steepest slope for MCF (4.44 mm/dose), indicating a greater per dose potency than the other sources. The ARC single donor source had the highest mean MCF across all dosing levels, but also the highest standard deviations and response variability. The ARC single donor source was significantly more potent than the Australian source. Conclusion: Paired with our estimates regarding the variability of clot formation responses to cryo, the quantitative dose-response curves provided in this study for CT, MCF, and alpha angle can provide physicians with more information regarding cryo dosing. Future studies that evaluate the therapeutic effect of cryoprecipitate versus fresh frozen plasma or fibrinogen concentrate would be of clinical importance and give us further insight into the relative utility of and dose requirements for cryo to correct dilutional coagulopathy.",

Background/Case Studies: Buffy coats (BC) from donors who used pain medication like aspirin and ibuprofen up to 4 days prior to the donation are discarded, because a known side effect of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is inhibition of platelet (PLT) aggregation. These NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1, thereby blocking synthesis of thromboxane A 2 from arachidonic acid. However, the quality of platelet concentrates (PC), prepared from this BC is not known. The aim of the study was to investigate the in vitro quality of PC prepared from NSAID-BC and autologous plasma during storage. Study Design/Method: Single-donor PC (sPC, n518) were prepared from a NSAID-BC and 60 mL of autologous plasma. Information about the type of pain medication was extracted from the anamneses form. The sPC were stored for 8 days at 22 6 28C and sampled at regular intervals. Aggregation tests were performed with Chronolog (ADP or collagen) and Multiplate (arachidonic acid) aggregometers. Thromboelastography (TEG, kaolin) was applied for assessment of the overall clotting capacity. sPC in plasma from normal controls (n55) were investigated as a reference. Values are expressed as mean6SD or as median & IQR. A non-paired t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test was applied for statistical analyses of normal or nonnormal distributed data respectively. Results/Finding: Volume (69 6 4 vs. 66 6 16 mL) and PLT content (67 6 14 vs. 71 6 15x10 9 ) were similar in both groups. On Day 8, both groups showed comparable pH and changes in PLT content (data not shown). Phosphatidylserine exposure on Day 8 was significant higher in a subset of donors who had used ibuprofen (n55). Aggregation tests with arachidonic acid revealed in general a low or absent response for sPC with aspirin (0,0-30, p<0.05), diclofenac (31,1-76) and naproxen (0,0-24, p<0.05), compared to normal controls (76, . No differences were detected in aggregation with ADP or collagen. With TEG, slightly longer R-times (initiation phase) were measured on Day 1 in sPC with aspirin, diclofenac and naproxen, compared to the normal controls (only significant for naproxen). These differences disappeared during storage.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Storage properties of sPC prepared from NSAID-BC were comparable with sPC from normal controls. Main differences were observed in aggregation and coagulation properties for donors who used aspirin, diclofenac or naproxen. PLT from donors who used ibuprofen showed little or no deviations. This is most likely caused by the fast (<24 hour) disappearance of ibuprofen from the blood circulation and the reversible binding to PLT. The use of BC from donors who used ibuprofen will be further investigated in a 'worst case' (PC in plasma) and 'best case' (PC in additive solution) scenario. The effects of ibuprofen on aggregation and coagulation properties will be further investigated in a dose-response study design adding different levels of ibuprofen to PLT. Background/Case Studies: Previously it was shown that donors could be classified as having platelets (PLT) with good, average or poor storage properties [Bontekoe, Transfusion, 2014] . A main difference between 'good' and 'poor' storage properties involved metabolic activity, resulting in a faster decline of pH during storage of 'poor' PLT concentrates (PC). This might be caused by a different functionality of the PLT mitochondria and there are indications that donors with a history of 'poor' PCs are more likely to have health issues, pointing towards Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Because of the strong rise of people with T2D in the Dutch population, the aim of this study was to characterize PLT from whole blood donors diagnosed for T2D, but accepted as donor. Study Design/Method: Twelve whole blood donors with T2D, not using insulin, were selected and buffy coat (BC) and plasma were, after overnight hold, used for preparation of a single-donor PC (sPC). An equivalent number of sPC was prepared from age and sex matched control donors, derived from the same collection sessions. sPC were stored for 8 days at 22 6 28C and sampled on Day 1, 4 or 5 and 8. The diabetic marker HbA1c was determined in red cells and cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma. From both groups 3 'good' (pH day8 >6.6) and 3 'poor' (pH day8 <6.3) storing sPC were selected and analysed in more detail. Results/Finding: Donors were of age 57 6 10 year and primarily men (75%). Donors with T2D had a higher mean BMI (30.3 6 4.6 vs.25.4 6 3.4 kg/m 2 ) and higher HbA1c than controls. The sPC of both groups had the same volume (70 6 5 vs 726 2 mL) and PLT content (71 6 9 vs 73 6 11x10 9 ) but on Day 1 glucose concentration was higher in the diabetic group (20.5 6 1.7 vs 18.9 6 1.4 mM, p<0.05). On Day 8, the average in vitro quality was comparable in both groups (data not shown). When combining 94A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 the selected 'good' and 'poor' storing PLT from both groups, a large difference in lactate production was observed (0.14 6 0.04 vs 0.36 6 0.03 mmol/ day/10 11 PLT). The 'poor' PLT showed a faster decline of the mitochondrial membrane potential (as measured with JC-1) during storage than 'good' PLT. Remarkably, a difference in triglyceride levels was detected on Day 1 ('poor':2.2 6 0.7 vs 'good':1.1 6 0.2, p<0.01). Conclusion: BC from donors with T2D who did not use insulin and fulfilled all donor criteria, were comparable with BC from age and sex matched controls, and seem suitable for preparation of PC. When selecting the 'good' and 'poor' storing PLT from the combined groups, the results of our previous study were confirmed, with significant differences in glycolysis rate and functionality of mitochondria. Metabolic Syndrome and T2D are still suspected as health issues involved in 'poor' storage of PLT because donors were of high mean age and because of the observed differences in triglyceride levels between 'good' and 'poor' stored PCs.",

The manufacturer recommends minimum wait time of 30 minutes prior to filtration. Anecdotally, the vendor states waiting an hour improves the leukoreduction. We experienced leukoreduction failures in January and February of 2017 detected by our routine QC. We initiated an investigation as to the cause of these unexpected failures. Study Design/Method: For each of the leukoreduction failures, the following factors were analyzed: collection time, length of filtration, length of wait time prior to filtration, platelet count, staff performing the process, the lot number of the collection system bag, and whether or not units collected from the same donor failed leukoreduction in the past. Hemoglobin S determinations were not sought out as no repeat donor failures were noted and our donor population would suggest a minimal number of donors would be found to be hemoglobin S positive. Results/Finding: A relationship was established between the length of time the product rested or waited prior to filtration and leukoreduction failure. We found that shorter wait times increased the percentage of leukoreduction failures (see table 1). All units that failed had wait times less than one hour. A similar trend was noticed for the previous year. The investigation showed no relationship between length of collection time, or the length of filtration time and leukoreduction failure. Staff performing the filtration was ruled out as possible cause as the failures were spread out among numerous personnel and observation of their technique displayed no sample collection issues. Platelet counts on the donors involved were available and none were outside of the normal range. Various lot numbers of the collection sets were involved, and no donors were repeat failures. Conclusion: In our small study, we found that following manufacturer's recommendations for the resting or wait time prior to filtration was insufficient to avoid excessive leukoreduction failures. We extended our minimum wait time to 60 minutes based on our data. We have not experienced any leukoreduction failures after this change.",

This can be helpful to determine those who may benefit from prompt initiation of TPE when tests such as ADAMTS13 are not readily available. We report a young pediatric patient presenting with diarrhea in the setting of laboratory results suggestive of a microangiopathic thrombocytopenia suspicious for TTP in which A-IPC measurement was clinically useful. Study Design/Methods: Previously healthy 12 month old unvaccinated girl presented with history of diarrhea for 5 days which was bloody at onset, accompanied by fever and dehydration. Laboratory results showed: white blood cell count: 32 x 10 9 /L, platelets: 62 x 10 9 /L, BUN: 77mg/dL, creatinine: 2.4mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 1940 U/L. Hospital course was complicated by tonicclonic seizure episodes that stopped with anti-convulsants and acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis. Peripheral blood smear revealed schistocytes. On third day of hospitalization, platelet count decreased to 44 x 10 9 /L, ADAMTS13 sample was sent out and TPE was initiated for clinical suspicion of TTP versus hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical versus Shiga-toxin mediated. Immature platelet fraction (%-IPF) and calculated A-IPC (%-IPF x platelet count) were obtained with daily pre-TPE CBC. A-IPC ratio was calculated from baseline. Results/Findings: Platelet count began to increase prior to TPE initiation (74 x 10 9 /L and A-IPC of 4.7 x 10 9 /L). Two consecutive TPE were completed which resulted in a platelet count decrease to 54 x 10 9 /L and A-IPC of 5.1 x 10 9 /L. A-IPC ratio was 1.1 below the ratio of 3 which has been reported for TTP patients. Similarly A-IPC count was not below 5 x 10 9 /L threshold reported in setting of TTP with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. At this time stool culture obtained prior to start of TPE came back positive for E. coli O157:H7 toxin. Testing of C3, C4, Factor H, Factor H autoantibody, Factor I and Factor B were normal. ADAMTS13 activity was 93%. Patient was treated for the infection and platelet count improved within 10 days to 315 x 10 9 /L, with resolution of her renal failure: BUN: 42 mg/dL, creatinine: 0.65 mg/dL. No additional seizures were observed during follow-up. Conclusion: Measurement of A-IPC can be used to aid clinical decisions in pediatric patients suspected of TTP especially when ADAMTS13 testing and those for other etiologies are still pending. TPE did not seem to have a significant effect in A-IPC but decreased platelet counts in this patient. A-IPC is rapid to obtain and can provide helpful information in the setting of potentially overlapping etiologies in the setting of other testing with longer turnaround time. Background/Case Studies: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by low ADAMTS13 activity. Many patients with severe autoantibody-mediated ADAMTS13 deficiency at initial disease presentation may suffer from one or more recurrent episodes over the following months or years. It is unclear if disease course and characteristics of recurrent/relapsed TTP may be different from that seen at initial presentation. Since absolute immature platelet counts (A-IPC) have been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and to follow response to therapy of TTP patients, we proceeded to evaluate if A-IPC pattern was different in relapsed verse initial presentation. Study Design/Methods: Our study cohort consisted of three patients (two female and one male) with acquired TTP (ADAMTS13 activity <5%) who underwent daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Clinical course and laboratory values were reviewed. Platelet count (PLT), immature platelet fraction (%-IPF) and A-IPC (%-IPF x platelet count) were analyzed during treatment course. A-IPC values at presentation and peak, A-IPC peak time (days), and PLT count recovery time (days) were compared between initial onset and relapse episode for each patient. A-IPC percent change in relapse episodes compared to initial presentation was calculated. Results/Findings: All patients had an increased %-IPF, and decreased A-IPC and PLT count at presentation in both initial and recurrent episodes. Once TPE treatment was initiated, A-IPC rapidly increased and reached a peak value 2-3 days prior to PLT count recovery, consistent with that previously described in TTP patients. However, compared to first onset, recurrent episodes featured lower A-IPC at presentation (results shown as percent decrease, column 1), increased peak A-IPC value (results shown as percent increase, column 2), delayed A-IPC peak, and delayed PLT recovery (Table  1) . Moreover, recurrent episodes required more procedures compared to initial presentation (Table 1) . Conclusion: Recurrent/relapsed TTP demonstrate lower A-IPC at presentation and a delayed and increased A-IPC peak value in response to TPE compared to initial presentation. A longer treatment course was observed in recurrent patients. Future studies of more relapsed TTP patients are needed.",

In our study we intend to analyze the effect of plateletpheresis on the hematological parameters of these donors assessed prior to each subsequent procedure. We also try to compare the effect 3 cell separators used for plateletpheresis on the post donation hematological parameters. Study Design/Method: The study was conducted during February 2016 to March 2017 on all the repeat plateletpheresis donors coming to the Department of Transfusion Medicine for the 2 nd time within a month of the first plateletpheresis. The values of the hematological parameters including red cell and platelet indices tested prior to each plateletpheresis were entered into the excel sheet and gap between each donations were calculated. The plateletpheresis were done either on Hemonetics MCS1 separator (Hemonetics Corporation, Braintree, Massachusetts, USA), Fresinius separator (COM.TEC), DN (Fresinius HemoCare GmbH, Bad Homburg v.d.H, Germany) and Gambro Trima Accel, software version 5.0 after taking consent from the donors. The target collection of each procedure was a dose of 3 x 10 11 platelets in 200-250 ml of plasma. To compare the effect of the cell separators on the hematological parameters due to the plateletpheresis, parameters at 2 consecutive donations within 7 days were considered. Data was analyzed by Stata 14. Within change in the continuous variables were assessed by paired t-test and between two groups comparison was done by independent t-test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The comparison among the cell separators was done by Kruskal-Wallis test or one way ANOVA. Results/Finding: Of the 98 donors, 35 repeated the plateletpheresis within a week (group I) and 63 underwent 2 nd plateletpheresis within 8-30 days (group II). No significant alteration was found in the red cell or the platelet indices within either group but a significant difference in the variation of platelet counts of the 2 groups (p50.025). Though above the eligibility cutoff of 1.5 lakhs/ml, platelet counts were lower than baseline in group I donors whereas it was higher at 2 nd plateletpheresis in group II donors. There were 49 donors who presented to us for the 3 rd time for plateletpheresis with a mean gap between 1 st and 3 rd plateletpheresis being 46 days. No significant difference in the parameters assessed prior to any of the plateletpheresis was found except the platelet distribution width (p50.000). Plateletpheresis through all the 3 cell separators had similar effects on the hematological parameters.",

In recent years, angiotensin II type-1 receptor antibody (AT1RAb) has been reported to cause AMR, especially refractory AMR, possibly by contraction of renal arteries. At our institution, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) followed by IVIG every other day has been applied to reduce AT1RAbs in kidney transplant recipients, and we here report efficacy of TPE treatments in two cases. Study Design/Methods: Two kidney transplant recipients who received TPE treatment followed by IVIG to decreased AT1R Ab are reviewed. Results/Findings: Case 1: The patient is a currently 43-year-old female with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis who received her first kidney transplant from a living related donor at age 22, and a second deceased donor transplant due to a rejection of the transplanted kidney at age 38. Three years post-transplant, her creatinine (Cr) started to rise from 0.7 to 1.35 mg/dl and a biopsy showed Banff criteria grade 2 AMR, grade 2A T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and grade 3 interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. HLA DSA had been negative in serum, but high level AT1RAb was identified at >40 U/ ml (high: >17 U/ml, intermediate: 12-17 U/ml, negative: <12 U/ml). She received 6 TPE treatments every other day and started losartan. After a course of TPE, AT1RAb decreased to 32 U/ml and histology showed improvement of AMR and TCMR, however, Cr kept increasing slowly to 1.9 ml/dl. In one month, her AT1RAb increased again to >40 U/ml, therefore, she received 3 more TPE treatments with a decrease in her AT1RAb to 16 U/ml. Although AT1RAb level increased slightly to 20 U/ml after 3 months, her Cr has been stable at 1.3-1.6 ml/dl. Case 2: The patient is a 25-year-old Mean 1/-SE -54.71/-12.9% * 183.1%1/-12.8%* * p<0.05 96A female with malignant hypertension who received a deceased donor kidney transplant at age 24. Her Cr started to rise 2 weeks post-transplant from 1.4 to 2.68 mg/dl without detectable HLA DSA. Although biopsy showed no AMR or TCMR, there was focally severe arteriopathy. She was found to have high AT1RAb level at 18 U/ml. She received 6 TPE procedures every other day and AT1RAb decreased to 8 U/ml with a decrease of Cr to 1.98 mg/dl and improved arteriopathy in histology. Because her AT1RAb level slightly increased to 12 U/ml over the next 2 weeks, she started weekly TPE treatment. After 5 weekly TPE, TPE treatment was stopped because her AT1RAb level remained relatively unchanged. Her Cr has been stable at around 1.5 ml/dl to date. Conclusion: We present 2 kidney transplant recipients who received TPE treatments for high AT1RAb levels. A course of TPE procedures followed by IVIG every other day was effective to decrease AT1RAb levels; however, weekly TPE had no effect on reducing AT1RAbs. TPE treatment may be also beneficial to improve histological AMR and clinical kidney function.",

The patient outcomes analyzed are similar to results in published literature. Conclusion: Cases treated in our hospital confirm the efficacy of ECP in SS treatment, with a good safety profile. Another great advantage of ECP is the relative lack of immune suppression. Many questions remain still unanswered about ECP: which schedule is the most suitable one, how we must continue or stop when partial or complete remission is achieved; and the number of leukocytes to be treated, as techniques as mini-photopheresis are also getting good results.

By the third hospitalization day Hgb improved to 10 g/dL, however with worsening thrombocytopenia (16 x 10 9 /L) that led to clinical concern for TTP. Peripheral smear showed many red cell fragments. Patient was transfused with platelets day prior to first TPE. Immature platelet fraction (%-IPF) and A-IPC (%-IPF x platelet count) were obtained with daily pre-TPE CBC. A-IPC ratio was calculated from baseline. Results/Finding: Four TPE in five days were performed (hospital days 6-10). Platelet count and A-IPC improved to 52 x 10 9 /L and 6.6 x 10 9 /L respectively just prior to first TPE. Response to four TPE led to a decrease in both platelet count (30 x 10 9 /L) and A-IPC 1.98 x 10 9 /L. These dynamics did not resemble those which had been described for TTP patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency. ADAMTS13 obtained prior to TPE initiation was resulted at this time and was 67%. No causative organism or toxin was identified after urine, blood, and stool examination and culture. Based on these results, TPE was discontinued which led to an immediate increase in A-IPC (2.64 x 10 9 /L) that preceded platelet count increase to 80 x 10 9 /L three days later when patient was discharged. Other laboratory values at this time were LDH of 635 U/L, Hgb: 11.2 g/dL in the setting of recovery of renal function. Conclusion: Timely diagnosis of TTP is essential to start of TPE. A-IPC dynamics differ in TTP compared to other thrombotic microangiopathies. In our patient A-IPC failed to improve despite TPE and improved once procedures were discontinued and were followed by increases in platelet counts three days later. When TTP is not the causative etiology, A-IPC can help adjust therapy and lead to clinical improvement. Further research is needed to characterize immature platelet dynamics in non-TTP microangiopathies.",

Since the introduction of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) as a treatment modality for TTP, its prognosis has improved dramatically. Nonetheless, some patients may develop relapse or refractoriness, with potentially fatal outcomes. Despite the notable progress that has been made with studies that emphasized the pivotal role of ADAMTS13, the epidemiology of TTP remains uncertain. Previous studies have suggested that many factors appear to influence its pathogenesis. Some studies point toward infection as a possible trigger which may contribute to the development and can ultimately influence its clinical course. One of the theories to explain this association is the possible cross reactivity between antibodies targeting infectious pathogens and those directed against ADAMTS13. The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the potential association between infection and the clinical outcome in a cohort of patients with idiopathic TTP. Study Design/Method: Patients with idiopathic TTP who underwent TPE from January 2008 through March 2017 were studied. Sessions were performed daily until platelets and reticulocytes had been normal, then sessions were gradually tapered. We only included patients with ADAMTS13 activity of less than 10%. Data on infections that occurred at or within a week prior to the development of TTP were analyzed. Results/Finding: Thirty-two patients were categorized as idiopathic TTP with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Eight patients (25%) were associated with suspected bacterial infection. Four of the 8 patients (50%) showed acute relapse coincident with bacterial infections. Central line associated Staphylococcus aureus infections occurred in three patients and Acinetobacter urinary tract infection was reported in one patient. One patient had symptoms of respiratory infection before the development of TTP, on his initial as well as his relapsing episode. Refractoriness to treatment was demonstrated in 3 patients. It was associated with dental abscess in one patient. The other two were associated with Mycoplasma Pneumonia. TPE sessions were continued in all refractory patients until their death. Conclusion: In patients with idiopathic TTP refractory to conventional treatment, a serious consideration should be given to non-idiopathic causes, particularly the presence of a remote source of infection, which can be an additional triggering factor for their initial and / or recurrent episodes.",

Leukodepletion preceding chemotherapy helps preventing leukostasis and hiperviscosity, and aims to reduce metabolic and renal complications associated with cell lysis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of leukapheresis procedure in pediatric patients with less than 10 kilograms using a single apheresis procedure. Study Design/Method: In October 2015 and June 2016, two children with possible leukemia were submitted to TL procedure. They were 6 and 9 months old, and weighted 7,0 and 9,1 kilograms. central venous catheters were placed, and apheresis were performed using a continuous flow apheresis system. The device was primed with 285 ml of ABO, Rh and Kell compatible, leukocyte-reduced, irradiated, 64% hematocrit packed RBCs, and the anticoagulant used was ACD-A plus heparin (750 mL of ACD-A and 7,500 units of heparin), at a blood to anticoagulant ratio of 25:1. A complete blood count was determined before and after apheresis. The room was heated to avoid hypothermia, and ionized calcium was measured every 30 minutes to prevent hypocalcemia. During the collection, changes in blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate were observed. Net fluid balance was calculated as the sum of the volume of anticoagulant, cation and nondiverted apheresis prime solutions minus the product volume. When the procedure was completed, the blood that filled the apheresis tubing was discarded. The patients were in the intensive care unit (ICU) under the supervision of a pediatric physician and ICU nurse who were aware of potential adverse events, and the procedure were performed by two hematology physicians and the nurse practitioner. Results/Finding: The white blood cell (WBC) in blood was counted immediately before apheresis in both subjects, and were 120.000 and 150.000/ mm 3 . The formula \"Collection Pump Flow 5 0,0003 x Inlet Flow x Preapheresis WBC count\" was used with the goal of removing up to 3 x 10 9 leukocytes/mL. A single leukapheresis procedure was performed with 2 total blood volume processed per patient. Immediately after the 2-hour procedures, WBC count were 74.000 and 92.000 WBC/mm3, and 12-hour post TL, WBC count were respectively 45.000 and 70.000/mm3. Net fluid balance was zero in both procedures, and the patients required no transfusion. Conclusion: TL was safe and efficient. Experience with leukodepletion in infants is limited, and a procedure in children weighing 10 kg or less needs forethought and a multidisciplinary effort, hence operators need to customize procedures for safe collection. However, despite the potential complications that may occur (placement of adequate vascular access, management of low extracorporeal blood volume, anticoagulant-related toxicity with metabolic and hematologic issues), remains an excellent source for leukoreduction in hematologic malignant diseases. Background/Case Studies: Nationwide apheresis registry can give us information on the current status and trend regarding apheresis procedures. Data can be compared with other regions to find and understand differences in perspectives, indications, technology, and clinical practice. The Korean Society for Apheresis (KSFA) has launched an online web based registry system for apheresis procedures since 2006. We report the data from the year 2016. Study Design/Method: The registry is consisted of two sub-registries. One addresses the overall aspects of apheresis procedures performed at each institute, and the other is focused on therapeutic plasmapheresis procedures. Data is registered by voluntarily participating hospitals in Korea. Results/Finding: A total of 13,302 apheresis procedures were performed at 37 hospitals. Therapeutic plasmapheresis was the most frequent procedure (50.4%) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection (23.9%), allogeneic PBSC collection (11.0%), donor leukapheresis (4.0%), and therapeutic leukapheresis (3.9%). COBE Spectra (37.4%) and Amicus (16.8%) were the most widely distributed instruments. Centrifugation was the dominant technique (92.2%) for therapeutic plasmapheresis. Detailed information was given for 4,199 therapeutic plasmapheresis procedures performed on 786 patients (some items were not completely filled out). Spectra Optia (42.7%) and COBE Spectra (26.6%) were the most frequently used instruments for therapeutic plasmapheresis. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was used most frequently (47.2%) as the replacement fluid followed by 5% albumin (26.3%), 4% albumin (13.3%), and 5% albumin 1 FFP (11.1%). Most of the procedures were performed for 1 plasma volume (72.4%). ACD (88.4%) and heparin (11.5%) were used for anticoagulation. Central venous catheter (91.9%) was the dominant type of vascular access. Major clinical indications were desensitization for ABO incompatible renal transplantation (24.1%), antibody mediated rejection in renal transplantation (19.9%), thrombotic microangiopathy (11.5%), desensitization for ABO compatible renal transplantation (4.7%), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (4.6%), and hyperviscosity in monoclonal gammopathies (4.6%). Adverse reactions were observed in 8.5% of the procedures. Allergic reaction (55.2%), hypocalcemic symptom (20.4%), and hypotension (6.9%) were frequently reported. Therapeutic effect was achieved in 86.5% of the patients.",

Study Design/Method: We reviewed the medical records of 41 pts who were diagnosed with HP from January, 2009 through January, 2017, and referred for immunotherapy evaluation. 27/41 (66%) pts received conventional therapy (CT) and PE (PE group), and 14/41 (34%) pts received CT alone (CT group). Mean age was 36 years (range 16-79), and 56% were female. Baseline mean triglyceride level (normal <150 mg/dl) for PE group was 6,728 mg/dl (4,652-12,486) versus 3,142 mg/dl (1,697-5,120) for CT group. Baseline mean lipase level (normal <393 U/L) for PE group was 1,798 U/L (797-2,745) versus 923 U/L (472-1,796) for CT group. Results/Finding: All pts were treated with dietary restriction (lipid-free diet, or nothing by mouth) and aggressive lipid lowering protocols involving 2-3 medications. 24/27 (89%) of PE group and 11/14 (79%) of CT group received insulin therapy to manage symptoms (sxs) of hyperglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis. 20/27 (75%) of PE group and 6/14 (43%) of CT group received heparin therapy to stimulate lipoprotein lipase release. The PE group underwent an average of 2.85 PE treatments (txs) (median of 2, range 1-4 daily txs) using 5% albumin; 7/27 (26%) required FFP to treat dilutional coagulopathy. In most cases, we did not perform PE txs when baseline triglyceride levels were <3000-4000 mg/dl and lipase <950-1375 U/L (2.5-3.5 X upper limit of normal). Mean triglyceride levels after 2 PE txs were 1,976 mg/dl (627-3,968) for PE group (mean decrease 72%); mean triglyceride levels after 48 additional hours of ongoing CT were 1,576 mg/dl (487-2,873) for CT group (mean decrease 50%). While the PE group achieved a greater mean decrease in triglyceride levels after 2 PE txs (compared to the CT group after 48 hours of CT), both groups experienced marked improvement in clinical sxs of pancreatitis and hyperglycemia (p>0.05). Limitations of the retrospective cohort study include lack of long-term follow-up.",

However, there had been rising cost and supply shortage of imported albumin in our country. To solve the problem, our National Blood Centre had established a plasma fractionation plant to manufacture plasma derivatives including albumin. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of local albumin as a replacement for TPE. Study Design/Method: All TPEs using local albumin as a replacement from two tertiary care hospitals performed from June 2016 through February 2017 were included. Complete blood count and serum calcium were tested before TPE. Serum albumin was tested before and after TPE. Local albumin is available as a 20% solution. Before using, it was diluted to a 4% albumin concentration with normal saline. All the patients were hospitalized and received oral calcium before TPE to prevent hypocalcemia. The adverse effects were recorded. Results/Finding: The total of 156 TPEs in 38 patients were included as shown in the Table. Neurologic disorders were the most common indication for TPE, followed by autoimmune diseases. The median total plasma volume was 3,000 (range 1,750-4,200) mL. Although the corrected calcium level was low (<8 mg/dL) in 3.2% (5/156) before the procedure, no clinical manifestation of hypocalcemia was detected. Adverse effects were observed during the TPE procedure in 2 patients. The first patient had 2 events of mild symptomatic hypotension. He previously took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The second patient complained nausea after finishing TPE. All reactions were mild. The incidence of adverse effects was 1.9% (3/ 156). In 2014, the incidence of TPE adverse effects was 1.6% (2/125) when commercial albumin was used. The difference was not statistically different (P 5 1.000). Median serum albumin levels pre-TPE and post-TPE were 3.6 (1.9-4.4) and 3.9 (2.4-5.0) g/dL. The increase in serum albumin after TPE was statistically significant (p<0.001). Eighty-two percent of pre-TPE serum albumin levels were lower than 4.0 g/dL explaining the rises of albumin after the procedures.",

AKH Vienna University Hospital, Cyto-Care.eu Background/Case Studies: Within the EU the collection of mononuclear cells (MNC) as starting source for the manufacturing of autologous cell therapies are mainly performed in hospitals or hospital-associated apheresis centers. We report about the challenges to perform the leukapheresis procedure (LA) at a private held medical practice, with specific emphases on safety, cell collection efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Study Design/Method: We reviewed the records of altogether 60 outpatients who underwent a total of 100 LA procedure at Cyto-Care, a private held medical practice/ certified cell collection facility located in Vienna, Austria. All patients participated in various industry-sponsored clinical P I-III trials; the study sponsors were responsible for the manufacturing of the active cell product. Disease entities were mainly prostatic cancer (75%) and ovarian cancer (20%). Based on differences in the study protocols LA was performed either one-time (41%), two-times (27%) or three-times (32%), with an interval of at least 2 weeks between repeated collections. Results/Finding: All patients successfully completed the apheresis course. Because of poor venous access, 3 out of 60 patients (5%) required a shortterm femoral catheter insertion. There were no serious side effects in patients who required a femoral catheter, or in patients with repeated LA procedures. Side effects of the LA procedure mainly consisted on mild hypocalcaemia-related symptoms in 16% of patients. A follow-up survey one week after completion of the LA revealed no infectious complications, and no patient required hospitalization. Median cell yield collected per single apheresis was 1.4x10 10 WBC consisting of 1.1x10 10 MNC. MNC cell yields remained stable even in repeated LA collections. All cell products were successful transformed into an active cellular product. Analysis of the cost structure showed that the total cost of care was 32% lower in the setting of a private collection center compared to hospital-based apheresis centers. Conclusion: Leukapheresis performed in a private medical practice/ certified cell collection facility is safe and effective, with low rates of complications and high levels of patient satisfaction. This service model is costeffective and can help to reduce the cost of manufactured goods in the production of innovative cellular products. Although typically associated with monoclonal gammopathies (e.g. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma), HVS has rarely been reported in patients with disorders of immune system such as rheumatoid disease, Sjogren's syndrome, HIV and IgG4-related diseases. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is indicated in HVS due to monoclonal gammopathy (ASFA category 1 indication). However, there are limited data for the utility of TPE in HVS due to polyclonal gammopathy. Study Design/Methods: A 70 year old female patient with a medical history significant for seropositive erosive rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cutaneous lupus and diffuse parenchymal lung disease, presented to our institution with complaints of progressive fatigue, muscle weakness, poor appetite, headache and epistaxis for a few months. Fundoscopic examination showed dilated and tortuous vasculature as well as bilateral retinal hemorrhages (mixed flame-shaped and dot-blot patterns).",

Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation demonstrated a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; protein precipitates were noted at the point of application, suggestive of circulating immune complexes. Serum IgG, IgM and IgA were 4610, 2890 and 1320 mg/dL respectively. A cryoglobulin screen was negative. Serum free kappa to lambda ratio was 1.74. Peripheral blood flow cytometry did not identify any monoclonal Bcell population. Plasma viscosity was noted to be 8.5 centipoise (cp) at admission (ref. range 1.6 -1.9). PET-CT imaging was negative. The patient was treated with high dose steroids; a single TPE procedure was performed using the following parameters: volume treated -1 total plasma volume; replacement fluid -5% albumin and normal saline in a 50:50 ratio; replacement fluid volume: 110% of the total volume processed. The procedure was tolerated without complication. Results/Findings: Immediately post-TPE her plasma viscosity level dropped to 2.4 cp.

TPE is indicated in acute phase or as a maintenance therapy to treat or prevent relapses in chronic phase. Study Design/Method: To assess the efficacy of plasma exchange in patients of NMOSD not responding to high dose intravenous steroids. we did a retrospective review of TPE records for patients with NMOSD over a period of three years (Jan 2013 -Dec 2016). TPE was done using, Cobe spectra (Terumo BCT, Lakewood Co. USA), replacing one to one and half patient plasma volume with 5% human serum albumin or Fresh frozen plasma on alternate days. The improvement in clinical signs and symptoms was recorded after each TPE procedure and at the end of the therapy. Adverse reactions if any were also recorded Results/Finding: Eleven patients of NMOSD between 4 to 35 years age (M: F; 1:2) underwent 62 TPE procedures with an average of 5.6 per patient. All the patients were on high dose immunosuppressant therapy without much clinical improvement. Three (27%) patients had only visual symptoms, 5 (46%) had both visual as well as muscular symptoms whereas 3 (27%) patients had muscular symptoms only. Three (27%) out of the seven tested, were positive for AQP4-IgG. All the patients showed significant improvement in their visual symptoms post exchange, from no vision/light perception to finger counting in two patients, recovery of colour vision and diplopia in six patients. Post exchange recovery in the muscle power was observed in 8 patients with grade-1, in 1 patient, and by grade-2, in seven. Adverse events were observed in 8% (5/62) of the procedures with allergic reactions to replacement fluid as most common event (n-3) followed by hypotension (n-2). Follow up was available in 55% (6/11) of patients and are doing well on immunosuppressive therapy. One patient died due to respiratory failure after 3 months and another had relapse for which he underwent second TPE cycle and continue to do well. Conclusion: TPE is a safe and effective adjunct therapy to high dose immunosuppression in NMOSD.",

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: TerumoBCT released Trima Accel software version 6.4 as an enhancement to allow for the collection of platelets (plt) with Platelet Additive Solution (PAS) and provide additional improvements to increase overall reliability. Additionally, the manufacturer identified a slower centrifuge speed at low draw flow rates. This software was expected to function similarly to version 6.0. The objective of this retrospective study is to identify any variances with the software upgrade influenced the plt products collection process or products collected. Study Design/Methods: Prior to 1/16/2016, plt collections were performed on nine Trima Accel machines operating with version 6.0. Upgrading and validating all nine machines to version 6.4 occurred from 1/16/2016 to 4/30/ 2016. The Trimas were programmed with the same plt configurations both before and after software update. Platelet collection data from version 6.0 (5/1/2015 to 9/30/2015) was compared to version 6.4 (5/1/2016 to 9/30/ 2016). Incomplete collections, runs identified as having possible leukocyte contamination, duration of collection, and plt split rate were evaluated for each time period. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to assess differences between plt collections with version 6.0 and 6.4, adjusting for multiple visits per donor, with significance defined as p-value < 0.05. Results/Findings: Following the upgrade to version 6.4, staff observed a number of changes including an increased centrifuge recovery time on a donor with a low flow and a notable increase in possible leukocyte contamination products. Version 6.4 of the Trima Accel showed a statistically significant increase in possible leukocyte contamination from 3% to 5% of collections as compared with version 6.0.

Therapeutic Leukocytaphersis (TL) is used as an adjuvant therapeutic modality in these patients with symptoms suggestive of leukostasis. TL procedures are performed using cell separators where anticoagulated blood is subjected to centrifugal force resulting in separate layers of cells and plasma depending on their density. There are two programs in the cell separator, a mononuclear (MNC)program which has greater centrifuge speed and efficiency for the collection of MNCs and a polymorphonuclear (PMN)cell program with lower centrifuge speed for the collection of PMNs. Hydroxyethyl Starch(HES) is preferred for the collections of granulocytes for transfusion from healthy donors. Use of HES facilitates the sedimentation of the granulocyte layer and increases the efficiency of collection. Though use of HES in TL was not associated with adverse events with its use as a volume expander (Pagano) its use in TL varies and no reports are available on the efficiency of leukodepletion using HES for TL. Study Design/Method: We received a request for leukoreduction in 32 yearold lady with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who had a good response to Imatinib. She is 30 weeks pregnant with an increased WBC count due to the discontinuation of Imatinib. We performed TL with the COBE Spectra using a replacement fluid of 500 ml 5% albumin. WBC counts were monitored pre and post TL in the patient and in the collected product. We modified the collection based on these results using the MNC program with ACD-A or the PMN program with ACD-A . As leukodepetion was not adequate with these programs we elected to use HES after discussion with the patient and her physician. TL was performed using 500 ml of HES with citrate and the PMN program. WBC pre procedure, immediate post procedure and the product was obtained and the efficiency of leukodepletion with the different programs was calculated. Results/Finding: The efficiency of % WBC depletion was calculated by product WBC to patient WBC based on blood volume and also Pre to Post WBC The patient tolerated the procedures well and there were no adverse reactions in the patient and in fetal monitoring during the procedures Conclusion: Therapeutic leukocytapheresis in CML patients is safe and more effective in reducing the WBC count with the use of 500 ml of hydroxyethyl starch with anticoagulant. Post procedure patient WBC counts sometimes may not provide the data on the efficiency of leucodepletion. ",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Early recognition of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) in the setting of acute pancreatitis (AP) is critical to initiate effective therapy. The role of plasmapheresis as an early/adjuvant approach in acute HTG-induced pancreatitis is controversial. Currently, there are no consensus guidelines in optimal therapy and is ASFA category III. Reported here is a case where the TG level as well as clinical symptoms improved after one therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Study Design/Method: A 45 years old male with history of hypertension, HTG, and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) presented to our emergency department with excruciating abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with HTG at 20 years old. He was treated initially with diet and lifestyle modification. However, his clinical course has been compromised after developing pancreatitis with 3 acute episodes requiring prolong hospital admission of approximately 2 months each which were successfully treated medically. However, the recurrent episodes resulted in chronic pancreatitis which was complicated with pancreatic pseudocyst and pancreatic insufficiency. Since the first episode of pancreatitis, he was then medically managed with fenofibrate, Lovaza, Lisinopril, Levemir and NovoLog. During evaluation on current admission, he was found to have a TG level of 4980 mg/dl, lipase 92 U/L, glucose 250 mg/dl, Bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, anion gap 12. CT findings were consistent with AP without evidence of necrosis and stable pancreatic pseudocyst. Medical therapy was started with Omega 3 fatty acid, fibrate, statin, hydration as well as pain control. Statin therapy was suspended on day 3 of hospitalization, because he was noted to have elevated liver function tests (LFT) and TPE was requested and started on day 3 after admission. Results/Finding: The patient TG decreased by 52% (2365 mg/dl) with medical therapy, followed by additional 67% (767 mg/dl) after one volume of TPE. His symptoms significantly improved and was discharged with medical treatment on day 6 after admission. Compared to previous episodes, his hospital stay was significantly decreased. TG levels remained below 1000 mg/dl at 20 days follow up after discharge. Conclusion: Early TPE may be of value in treating patients with elevated TG associated with recurrent pancreatitis. Plasmapheresis might be an effective early adjuvant therapy to mitigate length of hospital stay, improve cost-effectiveness and patient safety. Background/Case Studies: From 2009 to 2013, a national blood donor center in Southeast Asia conducted a program to monitor the ferritin levels of platelet blood donors. The aim of this study was to explore the trend of changes in ferritin. Study Design/Method: In this study, we collected 5,129 cases whose ferritin levels have been monitored more than twice with an interval of detection in 150-160 days. The collected plasma samples were tested for ferritin by chemiluminescence using a commercial assay. Inclusion criteria included apheresis platelet blood donors with over two results of ferritin, and first time ferritin test result was over 50 lg/L. And the upper limit was set to be 244 lg/ L in male and 158 lg/L in female as described in manufactures insert. The impact on ferritin from gender, age, and the blood donation frequency were examined with ANOVA test. The blood donations frequency was categorized into five groups: 0 times, 1 to 3 times, 4 to 6 times, 7 to 9 times and more than 10 times. The high frequency (more than 10 times group) blood donors were analyzed ferritin changes in longitudinal data. Results/Finding: There were 5,129 donors included in the study, of which 4,944 were male (96.4%) and 185 were female (3.6%). The mean ferritin was 82.0 lg/L in male (95% CI: 80.7-83.2 lg/L) and 66.5 lg/L in female (95% CI: 60.9-72.0 lg/L). The result of ANOVA indicates that the group with the highest frequency (more than 10 times) has the significant lowest ferritin level (p<0.05). The average change of ferritin if donation over 10 times would up to 13.4 and 14.1 lg/L in younger and elder 50 y/o male and 18 and 23 lg/L in female. And then for high frequency (half a year more than 10 times the group of blood donors) for longitudinal analysis and found that the long-term sustained high frequency of blood donation caused a significant decline in ferritin. The average change about ferritin in high frequencies donors (over 10 times in 150$160 days) was reduced from 21.5 lg/L in the first period to 4.1 lg/L in the third period (1 period5150$160 days). Along with the more and more period, the decline of ferritin decreased. Conclusion: This analysis revealed that frequent apheresis platelet donation would decrease ferritin of donors. But the high frequency of platelet blood donors who continue to donate after a year, the decline of ferritin slowed down.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: We report a case of whole blood (WB) donation that precipitated a transient agitated delirium. A 22 year-old first time male donor presented to the local blood center, completed the donor health questionnaire, mini-physical exam, and hemoglobin check, and was deemed eligible for blood donation. Approximately 10 minutes after an uncomplicated WB donation, the donor had an observed, brief loss of consciousness in the post-donation area. No fall or injury was seen. Shortly after regaining consciousness, the donor became agitated, confused, and was not oriented to month or year; was unable to remember the names of friends and family members; was unable to read an analog clock; and had difficulty with word finding. The donor was transported to the local university hospital where he was noted to be combatively delirious and had altered mental status; he had to be forcibly restrained. He ultimately was sedated and intubated, and transferred to the intensive care unit. Study Design/Method: An extensive laboratory investigation was performed including standard hematologic and chemistry panels; serologic and PCR-based studies for multiple organisms including West Nile, herpes, HIV, varicella zoster, and syphilis; aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures; and a urine drug screen for multiple drugs of abuse. Radiographic imaging was performed including a chest x-ray, and a CT and MRI of head and spine. In addition, an EEG was performed. The inpatient neurology and psychiatry services were consulted for this patient. Results/Finding: After the sedation was discontinued, the patient was successfully extubated and rapidly improved. He completely returned to baseline within 24 hours of onset of the event. Laboratory investigation revealed no signs of infectious organisms or evidence of drugs of abuse. Radiographic imaging and EEG studies showed no abnormalities. In addition, infectious disease marker testing performed by the blood center laboratory was negative. Investigation revealed that the donor was experiencing high levels of stress at school, had an aversion to the sight of blood, and was coerced into donating by his girlfriend and peers. A week following hospital discharge, the blood center medical director contacted the donor by phone; the donor had resumed his normal routine and was attending his graduate level classes. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of blood donation precipitating a transient acute delirium. At the time of donation, the health status of all potential blood donors is assessed to help ensure the safety of the donor and the recipient. The health questionnaire, physical exam, vital signs, hemoglobin level, and infectious disease testing help to identify overt signs of medical illness that may disqualify a donor. However, routine donor screening does not explicitly evaluate mental health issues, both diagnosed and undiagnosed. Although exceedingly rare, this case highlights the limitations of donor screening to identify donors who may be at risk for mental health adverse reactions when donating blood.",

One population in particular, African Americans, only account for 1% of blood donors in the United States. Literature indicates numerous reasons why this population is underrepresented amongst donors, including fear, lack of knowledge about the blood donation, and specific to this population, lack of trust in the medical community. Study Design/Method: African Americans in Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia were recruited through churches and local universities. The study's aims were to develop, implement, and assess a targeted educational approach incorporating the Theory of Planned Behavior and various teaching methods, to develop and implement a survey to evaluate participants' feelings, attitudes, and intent to donate, and to motivate African Americans non-donors to attempt to donate blood. Participants attended a 1-hour educational session where they were educated on the importance of red blood cell donations from African Americans. Participants completed three surveys -one before the session, one directly after the session and one, two months after the session. A two-proportion z-test was used to compare the known proportion of African Americans who present to donate in the study areas to those who presented to donate in this study, while regression analysis was used to estimate the relationships among survey variables. Results/Finding: A total of 142 subjects were included in the data analysis. Sixteen percent of the study participants presented to donate as a result of attending the educational session. This resulted in a statistically significantly higher proportion of African Americans presenting to donate than the current proportion in the areas of the state where this study was conducted. Results from the first two surveys indicated that subjective norm and attitude were significant predictors of one's intent to donate blood, while perceived behavioral control was not a factor. The educational session increased survey scores related to intent to donate in comparison to scores obtained prior to the session. Conclusion: This study shows that a targeted educational program can change attitudes toward blood donations in African Americans resulting in an increase in new blood donors. Additional studies are needed to see if this behavior will continue and whether African Americans can influence their community to increase awareness and motivation for life-long blood donation. were from female basic trainees Conclusion: The significant increase in hemoglobin deferrals at Basic Training Site A from 2015 to 2016 could be a result of a change in the blood drive timing of the training schedule of that location. In 2015, Basic trainees at site A were scheduled at day 57 of 70. In January 2016, the blood drive date changed to day 60 of 70. The extra three days in the Basic Training atmosphere, and its associated diet changes and increased physical activity may have had an effect on the hemoglobin levels in that population. At Basic Training Site B, the significant increase from 2015 to 2016 of hemoglobin deferrals can be attributed to a larger male population presenting at this site for Basic Training. Additionally, the percentage of female recruits donating at the blood drives decreased in 2016. These observations support the hypothesis that the increase in hemoglobin deferrals in 2016 resulted from the implementation of the male hemoglobin standard change from 12.5 to 13.0 g/dl at Basic Training Site B. When planning for blood drives at basic training site B, screening of an additional 24% of recruits must be considered when performing these blood drives, in order to meet the same collection goals set prior the implementation of the change in the male hemoglobin standard.",

Paralysis is a state, not a disease, after a reasonable time since its acquisition these people should not be differentiated from the rest of the non-paralytic population in terms of BC donation. The literature reviews of blood donation suitability criteria among these people are scarce and the vegetative lability that they may present depending on the type of their SCI it's obvious. In daily practice these potential donors are often rejected for donation with no specific criteria related to their SCI. The objectives of this study are to establish the selection criteria for BC donation in people with SCI based on medical criteria. To evaluate the rate of adverse donation blood reactions of these donors against a donor control group without SCI. Study Design/Method: Our organization regularly organizes a donation campaign at a rehabilitation center for patients with SCI. In this campaign some donors with SCI as donors without (professionals of the center, relatives, etc.) donate blood. From January 2015 to December 2016 we analyzed the number of donors who came to give blood, the number and reasons for exclusion of those who could not make the donation, whether or not they had SCI and number and typology of adverse reactions to the donation detected in both groups. Donors with SCI higher than T5 due to the high risk of autonomic dysreflexia were excluded for donation. Donors with SCI below T5 and less than one year of evolution were set as temporary exclusion criteria. The presence of neurogenic bladder was not considered a reason for exclusion. Results/Finding: In the analyzed period, 219 donors came to give blood, of these, 15 (7%) were excluded for donation for various reasons. Two of the donors excluded suffered SCI higher than T5 excluding them due their high risk of dysreflexia. Another one donor excluded suffered SCI lower than T5 but his hemoglobin levels were lower than our selection criteria. Of the 204 donors selected for donation 16 (7.8%) had SCI lower than T5 and T6. Adverse reactions to donation (1.4%) were recorded in our haemovigilance program, none of them in donors with SCI. Conclusion: According to our experience donors with SCI lower than T5 have not had any type of adverse reaction to the blood donation. There should be selection / exclusion criteria based on the donor's paralytic conditions. The vagal syndrome that could appear as a complication to the donation in these SCI donors should be approached differently to the usual protocols that we use.",

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: Blood pressure (BP) is important for determining the health and suitability of blood donors. The manual method of reading BP can result in variability due to minor variances in the way staff perform the manual procedure. Automated BP devices are able to reduce the variability in BP determination. In December of 2013, automated BP devices were validated and replaced the manual BP method in our blood donor center. The objective of this retrospective study is to determine if the change from a manual to an automated BP process has impacted the average systolic and diastolic pressures and, additionally, if a differences in the deferral and reaction rate can be observed. Study Design/Methods: Data for the manual BP process was accumulated for an 11 month period from January 2013 to November 2013. The same information was assembled for the automated BP process for the 11 month period of January 2014 to November 2014. The automated BP process implemented in mid-December 2013; so the December data for both 2013 and 2014 has been excluded from the study. BP, BP deferrals, reactions, donor weights and demographics were evaluated for each time period. A donor may be included multiple times in each year and could be in both sets of data. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess differences between automated and manual BP with significance defined as p < 0.05. Results/Findings: Significantly more people were deferred using automated BP compared to manual BP readings (p50.006). Both systolic and diastolic BP measured significantly higher by automated BP method than by manual method. Although donors in the automated BP group experienced fewer reactions than those in the manual BP group, the reduction was not large enough to reach statistical significance. Even after adjusting for gender, weight and age at donation, BP deferrals, systolic and diastolic BPs all remained significantly higher (all p < 0.03) with the automated BP while and reactions remained non-significantly lower (p 5 0.086).",

With a statistically significant increase in deferrals and marginal decrease in reactions, the use of automated BP devices may play a minor role in the safety of blood donors. For the purpose of this study, only the hemoglobin values that were below 12.5 g/dl will be compared as a surrogate for deferral. To adjust for multiple visits per donor, generalized estimating equations were used to assess significance between lancet A and lancet B, using the appropriate distribution for the data type, defining statistical significance as p-value < 0.05. Results/Findings: The average hgb was slightly lower with lancet B but there was a larger change with the number of donors under 12.5. Statistically more visits with hgb less than 12.5 g/dl used lancet B than lancet A. Additionally, fewer first time donors were seen during the lancet B time than during the lancet A time. After adjusting for the effects of both gender and first-time donation by using logistic regression, the risk of hgb under 12.5 was 16.5% higher with lancet B than with lancet A.",

Disliking the obligation imposed by appointments, Singaporean donors generally prefer \"walk-ins\" as opposed to appointment bookings. Blood Services Group (BSG) Singapore, has made a move to change donors' mindset by introducing automatic appointment scheduling. This paper aims to study donors' level of acceptance towards this initiative. Study Design/Method: To determine the donors' acceptance rate, data was collected from 1 January to 31 March 2017. After completing their donation, donors were automatically given the next earliest eligible date for their next donation. Those who do not wish to accept the recommended appointment can either decline this arrangement or log into the blood bank's donor appointment booking system (Donor-Care) to make changes to the appointment offered. A reminder will be sent to their phone via SMS and/or email to their account three days before the appointment date. Data was collected from Donor-Care and was used to measure the number of appointments made and declined over the three months period. Donors who declined appointment scheduling were verbally interviewed for their reasons. Results/Finding: A total of 6680 donors who has donated blood in the blood bank's main branch were used as the baseline for this study. 85% of donors (N55678) accepted automatic appointment booking, whereas some donors (N51002) were not comfortable with it. 77% of those who declined still preferred walk-ins (N5771) based on their own time schedule, the rest decided that variable situations (N5112), donation frequency (N569) and choice of preferred donation locations (N550) were reasons for declining automatic appointment booking. Prior implementation of appointment booking at other blood bank branches showed that donors who booked appointment through Donor-Care was 19%. A comparison was made and found that this study shown a significant increase of acceptance rate by 66%. Conclusion: Generally, the results were positive and the automatic appointment booking system enabled BSG to predict donor attendance, ensure better manpower management to reduce donor turnaround time and thus hopefully improve donor retention. BSG is still monitoring this automatic appointment system and future study are still required to determine the effectiveness of automatic appointment booking, donor return and retention rate. Currently BSG has 4 collection centers, each managing its own appointment system. The eventual aim is to be able to have a centralized appointment booking system whereby donors can book appointments and still be able to donate at any collection site. 4) , 3.28 0.4940 4 1 poisson distribution, 2 normal distribution, 3 logistic distribution, 4 lognormal distribution 105A TRANSFUSION (p>0.05) in donor and reference populations except in younger (20-44 yrs) male donors (p<0.0021; donor 4.9%, reference 10.0%).

The goal of this non-experimental, qualitative design study was to evaluate knowledge acquired through standardized DE materials. This study was IRB approved as an exempt protocol. Study Design/Method: We developed a DE document written at an 8 th grade comprehension level. A convenience sample of volunteers was identified for this two-part study. A focus group (FG) incorporated a pre-and post-quiz for knowledge acquisition from reading the four-page DE document. The quiz was followed by a group discussion for feedback. The preand post-quiz contained the same 10 multiple choice questions with single best answers including the option to answer, \"I don't know.\" The DE document was revised based upon the FG feedback and quiz results. The revised, 3.5 page, DE document was then tested using the same pre-and post-quiz during individual interviews (II). Results/Finding: Demographics and quiz results are summarized in table 1. Results from the FG and II revealed a lack of knowledge in four areas: a donor might be asked not to donate at any time during the donation process, the need for photo identification to donate, iron helps increase a low red blood cell level, and not to donate for the sole purpose to obtain HIV testing. Post-quizzes from the II group revealed an improvement in knowledge acquisition for all four areas. Feedback from both groups reiterated that the document was too long.",

            "text": "Hanwei Chen*. Wuhan blood center Background/Case Studies: In China, volunteer blood donors can donate platelets by apheresis (AP) up to 24 times per year. However, the awareness and knowledge of AP donation is much lower than whole blood donation among the Chinese population. There are approximately 1.3 million doses of AP transfused within 1.375 billion people each year In China; It is one challenge to recruit new AP donors and retention them as frequency AP donors in China. Study Design/Method: One stratified recruitment and retention strategy established and applicate at Wuhan blood center since 2006. Firstly, \"one-to-one\" telephoning model for whole blood donors instead to donate platelet; Secondly, group message for permanent AP donors and had not donated with an interval of more than 180 days in low inventory. Thirdly, specific recruiter telephone for those AP donors who had donated APs for more than 4 times and had not donated for more than 90 days or less than 4 times with an interval of more than 60 days from the last donation; The last one is preparing one letter of thanks for those AP donors who gave more than 8 times annually which advise them to voluntarily come to the blood center for AP donation when they were available. Results/Finding: Over the past decade, the overall donation time of AP donors increased by 7.46 times from 5550 to 41420 and the doses of AP increased by 7.41 times from 7363 to 54553 within 10 years. The APs collected fulfilled the clinical needs. According to the donation frequency, AP donors were divided into 5 groups: those who donated AP once, those who donated 2-4 times, 5-9 times, 10-29 times, and those who donated more than 30 times, respectively. It was found that the number of permanent AP donors who donated AP more than 30 times was only 965 (2.1%), but they denoted a total of 76432 doses of AP (29.2%) from 2006 to 2016. Conclusion: APs increased at a rapid and steady pace in Wuhan blood center from 2006 to 2016, which not only met the clinical needs but also were supplied to other region outside Wuhan. And in addition, the permanent AP donors who gained more attention donated the greatest percentage of platelets. In conclusion, stratified recruitment is one effective approaches to meet clinical needs for platelets and worth to popularize to other region. years were evaluated at 4 sites on 2 consecutive donations for finger stick (fs) hemoglobin (HB) per site policy. Venous (ven) and capillary (cap) ZPP and ven ferritin (Fer) were performed per manufacturers' direction. Donors were assessed for subclinical iron deficiency using ranges (Fer <26 ng/mL and ZPP levels >100 umol/mol heme) at 3 HB levels. Participants completed an online survey between donations to collect data on symptoms of anemia. Univariate linear regression analysis was used to determine relationship between tests. Results/Finding: Subclinical iron deficiency was present among first-time and repeat blood donors at all 3 HB levels with both genders and all age groups. (Table) There was a highly significant correlation between fs ZPP and ven ZPP 87.8% (R50.937) at first and 86.5% (R50.93) at second donations. At first donation when compared to fs HB, only 10.4% (R50.323) of variation could be explained by variation in fs ZPP, 12.3 % (R50.35) by ven ZPP and 9.4% (R50.307) by ven Fer. At second donation, when compared to fs HB, only 9% (R50.30) of variation could be explained by variation in fs ZPP, 14.4% (R50.38) by ven ZPP and 20.1% (R50.448) by ven Fer. For each donation, variation among tests (fs HB, ven Fer, ven ZPP and fs ZPP) was significant (p<0.001) suggesting strong evidence against correlation. 55% (181) responded to the survey of which 4% (13) reported not feeling well after donation. It should be noted that noted that 1% (3) female study participants reported feeling unwell after the first donation and had ferritin levels below 26ng/mL but the ZPP levels were less than 100 umol/mol heme. Of the 3% (10) male participants that reported not feeling well none had ferritin levels below 26 ng/mL nor ven or fs ZPP levels above 100 umol/mol heme.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Subclinical iron deficiency was present at all hemoglobin levels. There was insufficient correlation with fs HB and ven Fer to support use of fs or ven ZPP analysis as measurement of iron stores for blood donors. Symptoms reported by study participants were not consistent with laboratory results. The minimum male Hb was raised from 12.5 to 13.0 gm/dL. FDA imposed specific VS ranges for acceptable pulse (P) and blood pressure (BP), removing center-by-center discretion. A survey of members of America's Blood Centers (ABC) was performed to assess the impact on donor deferrals resulting from these changes. Study Design/Method: Online survey software (SurveyGizmo, Boulder, CO) was used to solicit collections and deferral information from 59 blood centers over two intervals, July-Dec. 2015 and July-Dec. 2016 (i.e., before and after the implementation deadline for the final rule respectively). Information on deferral at presentations for whole blood (WB) donations and apheresis platelet (AP) donations was requested for Hb thresholds and VS. The information was stratified by gender (male5M, female5F), and ABO type. Statistical analysis included t-tests for numerical and chi-square for categorical data (Minitab 17.0, Chicago IL). P <.05 was considered significant. Results/Findings: Data were provided by 40 of 59 centers invited, representing 2,420,886 and 2,945,802 WB donations and 272,094 and 319,161 AP donations in aggregate during the two intervals respectively. Gender and ABO distributions appeared representative of the US donor base. Among M WB donors the rate of deferral rose from 1.5% to 2.9% in the two intervals among aggregated donation attempts (p<.001), and for M AP from 1.8 to 3.5% (p<.001). The mean \"by center\" deferral rates (table) were similar to that and significant (p<.001). Mean by center Hb deferral rates among F donations during the two intervals were 11.6 and 11.9% (p50.241) for WB, 11.8 and 13.0% (p5.041) for AP, respectively, absent any change in their acceptable Hb thresholds. Data on VS deferrals were much sparser. For P deferrals, only 12 centers could provide specific high vs. low vs. irregular pulse deferrals; 27 provided only a summary (i.e total pulse deferrals), and 1 could provide none. For BP, 8 provided detail (high vs. low), 28 summary and 4 none. P deferrals increased in the successive intervals among F WB donors from a center mean of 0.57 to 1.49% (p5.018) and for M WB donors from 0.78 to 1.16% (p5.006). Where details were available, high and irregular pulses were responsible for most of the changes for both genders. BP deferrals were not significantly increased among WB donors, regardless of gender. The data sets and deferral rates re: VS in AP donors were quite small, possibly reflecting culling during their prior donation experience. Conclusion: Substantial additional donor deferrals attended the increased Hb thresholds for M in the final rule, for both WB and AP. Changes were more modest among female donors, consistent with the absence of changes in allowable Hb levels. Modest but significant changes attended more stringent requirements for VS, though data limitations restrict this aspect of the analysis. Background/Case Studies: Diabetes mellitus is reaching potentially epidemic proportions in India. Given the disease is now highly visible across all sections of society within India, there is now the demand for screening of diabetes and urgent research and intervention -at regional and national levels -to try to mitigate the potentially catastrophic increase in diabetes that is predicted for the upcoming years. Due to its ease of use, several studies have found that HbA1c testing can identify patients in the community who might otherwise go undiagnosed. We took an initiative to find out the incidence of diabetes by random blood sugar (RBS) measurement among Indian blood donors and measure the HbA1c levels among those with RBS >180 mg/dL Study Design/Methods: A prospective study was done at department of Transfusion Medicine and department of Biochemistry from 1 st March 2017 to 31 st March 2017. Total of 1,861 blood donors were tested for RBS. Those with RBS > 180 mg/dl were further tested for HbA1c by gold standard HPLC method using variant II Biorad. Blood donors with >180 mg/dl RBS and HbA1c > 6.5% were advised to consult a physician for further evaluation. Results/Findings: Of the 1,861 donors tested, 44 (2.36%) donors showed a RBS of > 180 mg/dl. Forty two (95.45%) were males and 2 (4.54%) females with a mean age of 40.55 years (26-56 years). Of these, 14 (31.81%) were known case of Type-II diabetes mellitus (DM) on oral medications and were excluded. Of the remaining 30, 8 (26.66%) of them had a family history of DM. Of these 30 donors, 8 donors did not give a consent for testing for HbA1c. Among the 22 donors tested for HbA1c levels, 16 (72.72%) had HbA1c > 6.5%. All the 16 donors were counselled and referred to a physician for further management. The overall incidence of donors having DM in the population is 0.87% (16 of 1839 donors). Conclusion: Screening for blood glucose level by targeting the blood donors can go a long way in curbing the diabetes burden on the society.",

Donors with low ferritin were immediately informed of their result, given iron supplements and advised to come back for donation after 4 months or more. Since donor health and safety is of paramount importance, measures to limit and prevent iron deficiency in blood donors must be implemented. Due to the high incidence of low ferritin levels in whole blood and apheresis donors with hemoglobin 12.5-12.9 g/dl, it is recommended that the minimum hemoglobin level cut off for male blood donors in Singapore be increased to 13.0 g/dl. Other measures to be implemented includes better donor education on the risk of iron deficiency and the need for iron supplementation using our website and social media.

Using an iron preparation which is better tolerated may increase compliance. Background/Case Studies: Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) patients are permitted to donate blood for the allogeneic blood supply as long as they are eligible for donation under 21CFR630.10 and the collection is a physician-ordered therapeutic phlebotomy. Blood collections Establishments do not need an exception or alternative under \u00a7 640.120 to make a collection under this provision if the requirements set forth in \u00a7 630.15(a)(2) are met. The objective is to describe current HH donors and long-term contributions of to our hospital-based donor center and hospital blood supply. Study Design/Method: In 2001, an IRB protocol was approved for the enrollment and therapeutic phlebotomy of HH patients/subjects. This required filing an FDA variance to permit HH donor blood for use in our allogeneic supply without disease labeling. The frequency of therapeutic bleeds are guided by routine clinical assessment, MCV/hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and transferrin % saturation monitoring. Serum ferritin levels of 50 -75 ng/ mL are targeted for maintenance phlebotomy. Operationally, a custom, computerized database application is employed to ease phlebotomy management. Results/Finding: Since inception, the cumulative number of HH subjects enrolled in the hemochromatosis protocol reached 547, of whom 365 (67%) are C282Y homozygotes. Without active recruitment, accrual rate is about 7 per quarter, with 69% of subjects qualifying as allogeneic donors. The mean current age is 59.7 years, 65% male, 96% Caucasian. The majority of HH donors (276 of an active cohort of 318) are in the maintenance phase of therapy with an average of 2.6 donations/year and a 4% deferral rate. Over the last 5 years, HH donors contributed approximately 8-11% of the hospital's allogeneic blood supply, averaging 475 whole blood units for transfusion per year. Moreover, HH donor's whole blood (WB) donations provided 30-40% of blood for in vitro research at our institution with an average of 180 WB research donations/year. There have been no HH donor-derived transfusion-transmitted infections over 16 years. Since 5/23/16, with an increase in male Hgb deferral threshold to 13g/dl, there has been only 1 HH male deferral from blood donation. Conclusion: A simple, safe system for donor evaluation, phlebotomy management, and transfusion of blood drawn from HH subjects was established. Blood donated by HH donors remains an important resource at our hospital. HH donors benefit from careful medical follow-up of their iron status. This mutually beneficial relationship is feasible and sustainable.",

In addition, the study examined operator ease of use and donor satisfaction with a finger stick-free method. Study Design/Method: Study procedures and protocol, including acceptance criteria, were defined in conjunction with the device manufacturer to determine the standard deviation (SD) of the difference between the NBM-200 non-invasive sample results and the Sysmex hematology analyzer venous sample results. Staff were provided training on the use of the NBM-200 non-invasive occlusion spectroscopy device. Over a span of 7 days, 200 eligible blood donors, both male and female, were first screened by the NBM-200 non-invasive occlusion spectroscopy device followed by performance testing utilizing a capillary blood screening method. A venous sample was collected from each of the 200 blood donors for the performance of Hb measurement on the Sysmex hematology analyzer within 1-3 hours of collecting the venous samples. Results/Finding: The SD of the difference between the NBM-200 non-invasive sample results and the Sysmex hematology analyzer venous sample results was not to exceed 1.1g/dl. The Hb measurements obtained from the NBM-200 and the Sysmex hematology analyzer were analyzed using the statistical software Minitab and the SD of the difference was reported to be 0.978 g/dl. The precision of the NBM-200 yielded a co-efficient of variation of .02 g/dl and a standard deviation of .33 g/dl. Conclusion: The operators found the NBM-200 easy to install, maintain, and operate with minimal training. The NBM-200 non-invasive occlusion spectroscopy technology showed accurate performance compared with the venous sample results.

Murphy* 3 . 1 SANBS, 2 RTI International, 3 UCSF/BSRI Background/Case Studies: To maintain an adequate blood supply, South African blood centers need to collect more blood from their majority Black African population. Success in recruiting first-time Black blood donors has been tempered by lower suboptimal return rates. Study Design/Method: We performed a prospective cohort study of firsttime, Black blood donors donating during a four-month period in 2014 and followed them for one year. Within 56 days post donation, a questionnaire including questions on blood donation motivators and deterrents was administered by telephone. Questions used 4-point Likert scales to assess agreement with statements relating to domains of altruism, collectivism, selfesteem and marketing derived from local focus groups (Muthivhi et al. 2015) . Linking questionnaires to a blood donation database allowed logistic regression analysis to predict return for a second donation within one year. Results/Finding: We included 2,902 first-time Black donors with median age 23 and female predominance (59%). Within one year, 1,786 donors (62%) attempted at least one additional donation. When Likert scales were analyzed as an ordinal variable (45 strongly agree to 15 strongly disagree), donor return was associated with the following motivators \"Blood donation is an easy way to make a difference\" (odds ratio for each Likert increment (OR) 5 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.28), \"I donated in response to adverts/campaigns on the radio, TV or newspapers\" (OR51.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.23). Responses to altruism-associated statements were not associated with return. Among deterrents, donors were less likely to donate if they agreed with the statement \"I am afraid of the sight of blood\" (OR50.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96) and \"I wasn't treated well by the <blood center> staff\" (OR50.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97). Surprisingly, donors were more likely to return if they agreed with the statement \"I was afraid of finding out about my HIV status\" (OR51.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.37). A secondary analysis treating the Likert scales as 4-level categorical variables revealed generally similar results, with the additional finding that donors who disagreed with the statements \"If I give blood then blood will be available when I need it\" and \"I don't know where the nearest blood collection point is\" were more likely to return. Conclusion: This novel design allowed us to study the link between donation motivators and deterrents and actual rather than intended return for donation. It is interesting that self-esteem and marketing predicted return better than altruism. Fear and poor customer experience are recognized deterrents which could be addressed. We plan to use these data to construct Black donor recruitment interventions which may be tested using randomized trial designs.",

In hopes of identifying factors to increase summer donations, our study investigated donor reported barriers which influence summer donations habits. Study Design/Method: An anonymous 16 question survey investigating various donation factors was administered across multiple blood donor centers in a state-wide region. Questions addressed donor demographics, frequency of blood donation, preference in appointment making modalities including smartphone app use, summer travel habits, willingness to donate during vacation, and factors that deter donors from donating on vacation. Results/Finding: A total of 292 surveys were received. Survey respondents across multiple demographic groups cited similar barriers to summer donation, namely \"Too busy\" (27.5 %) and \"Traveling is a time for me to relax.\" (30.6 %). Of the respondents who travel in the summer, very few reported donating while traveling (3.4 %). Summer donation rates between summertime travelers (36.5 %) and non-travelers (36.4 %) were essentially equivalent. The most preferred methods of scheduling appointments were via the regional blood donor center website (45.6 %) and phone (28.4%). Willingness to use a regional blood donation smartphone app was highest among respondents ages of 18 to 34 (45-55%) and lowest among ages 55 and older (13-15%).

Background/Case Studies: Viral infections (Adenovirus, EBV, CMV, BK, HHV6, and RSV etc.) have been implicated as major contributors to posttransplant morbidity and mortality in Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from unrelated donors. Investigators have shown that in-vitro expanded virus specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated from donors with specificity for one or more viruses are safe and effectively treat viral infections in the HSCT setting in recent clinical trials. Present clinical trials have shown that CTLs can be rapidly produced by a single stimulation of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a peptide-mixture spanning the target antigens in the presence of potent prosurvival cytokines interleukin-4(IL-4) and IL7. Others have used banked third party Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-specific CTLs generated from third party EBV-seropositive blood donors with encouraging results. Study Design/Methods: Eligible and consented Blood donors were tested for CMV antibodies by serology. CMV-seropositive Whole Blood (WB) units underwent buffy coats processing from non-leucocyte reduced WB units collected in Fenwal triple Blood-Packs TM that underwent 2 hard spins at 3800 rpm for 7 minutes with separation after each spin on a CompoMateV R G5. Plasma and buffy coat was separated from red cells after the first spin. The second spin lead to the separation of the buffy coat from plasma. The buffy coats were submitted to the GMP Stem Cell Lab for processing of Cytomegalovirus-specific CTLs. HLA typing at high resolution for HLA-A/-B/-DRB1 loci was obtained for all donors. Results/Findings: Forty five eligible healthy blood volunteers (13M [29%]: 32 [71%] F); median age 42 years (range 21-70) donated a unit (500 mL) blood from which buffy coats (average volume 56 ml) were processed. The buffy coat process was previously validated on 20 WB units. The mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) recovered from the buffy coats are listed in figures 1 and 2.

Most (32/73, 44%) of the MSBOS' were created by a combination of obtaining consensus between the surgical services and blood bank and use of procedure-specific transfusion data; only 5/73 (7%) of MSBOS' were created solely by using procedure-specific data, and most (35/73, 48%) do not use patient-specific data in making a testing recommendation. Most MSBOS' are updated less frequently than annually (30/73, 41%), and the hospital transfusion committee is often (39/73, 53%) involved in updating it. The MSBOS' are generally available electronically in both the operating rooms and in the blood banks. It was the opinion of the majority of respondents (30%) that the MSBOS was used regularly by only a limited number of surgeons and anesthesiologists, 23% of respondents felt that it was regularly used by all surgeons and anesthesiologists; 10% felt that it was not used at all at their hospital, 36% did not respond. Conclusion: An MSBOS was available in only about half of the respondent's hospitals and in only the minority of cases was it felt to be regularly used. However, 18% of the hospitals currently without one indicated that it would be implemented in 2017 suggesting that these hospitals perceive the value of having one in place. Implementing and following an MSBOS can be an important step in peri-operative patient blood management and in streamlining the operations of the blood bank vis-a-vis pre-operative testing.",

Methods to reduce phlebotomy for laboratory testing can reduce iatrogenic anemia. At a universitybased teaching hospital, a pathway to collect cord blood samples on all newborn deliveries was established. The cord blood sample is used for initial blood bank laboratory testing on newborn patients transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), preventing need for additional blood draw. The blood tubes are saved for 1 week post-delivery, with cost of $1.10 per delivery tray for sterile tubes. With an initial negative antibody screen on cord blood sample, no additional phlebotomy is required for blood product selection or compatibility testing in this population until four months of age. Study Design/Method: Labor and delivery data from our facility in 2016 was analyzed, and the gestational age and birth weight of all infants transferred to the NICU was collected. From this data, we were able to calculate the total blood volume of these infants using MedCalc 3000 system. By using the blood volume values, and assigning a value of 1.5 mL as the minimum amount of blood that would be drawn to perform an antibody screen, we calculated the percent of an infant's blood that would have to be drawn if the cord blood pathway was not established.",

Of those infants, 27% received at least one red blood cell transfusion and 7% received at least one platelet transfusion. Of the 487 infants transferred to the NICU, 98 (20%) had a percentage of blood volume that would have had to be drawn for blood bank testing greater than or equal to 1% (which we considered to be significant), had the cord blood pathway not been in effect. The percentage of blood volume preserved in these infants ranged from 1.0% all the way up to 3.9%. In those 98 infants, the birth weight ranged from 400-1650 grams, and the gestational age ranged from 22 weeks to 36 weeks and 4 days. Conclusion: The established cord blood pathway has proven to be a relatively cost-effective method to prevent iatrogenic blood loss secondary to blood bank testing in a population of NICU infants who are most susceptible to iatrogenic anemia. The infants that were most likely to benefit from this policy are premature infants who are low birth weight (less than 2500 grams).",

However, in the event of MTP activation outside of an OR, sufficient and/or appropriately trained individuals may not be present. This can lead to a scene of confusion and chaos with potential for patient harm. Study Design/Method: A Failure Mode Effects Analysis was performed to develop a standardized process for managing MTP outside of an OR setting. With participation from anesthesia, surgery, transfusion medicine, patient safety and quality and nursing, every step of the hospital's MTP was analyzed for potential errors. The results were used to create a \"code hemorrhage\" team trained to respond to any massively hemorrhaging non-OR patient. Results/Finding: Code Hemorrhage represents a multi-system team critical event requiring coordination of different sub-teams (primary resuscitation, surgical/interventional, transfusion services, blood preparation, equipment management, medication management, and lab requisition/monitoring). Our Code Hemorrhage protocol utilizes critical care trained nurses from the hospital's rapid response team who play two key new coordination roles: hemorrhage coordinator and electronic medical record (EMR) coordinator. Their combined roles serve to reduce the cognitive load of the various teams, prevent duplication of resources/efforts during MTP and enable enhanced closed loop task performance. The hemorrhage coordinator establishes reliable 1:1 communication between the primary resuscitation team and transfusion services, and aids in multi-team on-site coordination. The EMR coordinator enters all orders into the EMR, sends/communicates laboratory results and ensures blood products are available to the resuscitation team. The primary resuscitation team includes a team leader (medical decision making and cardiac life-support management); a proceduralist (establishing venous and/or arterial access), event documenter (real-time documentation of actions, medications, events, etc.), medication manager (registered nurse who prepares and administers medications) and equipment technologist (managing rapid blood product infusion devices). Additional secondary roles will also be assigned, such as blood product checker(s) (verifies blood product prior to transfusion) and blood bank runner (courier sent to retrieves blood product shipments). Conclusion: The code hemorrhage protocol is designed to ensure timely, efficient delivery of blood products to massively bleeding patients outside of an OR setting. Future work will assess its overall effectiveness by comparing blood product utilization/wastage and patient outcomes before and after implementation. Background/Case Studies: Preoperative anemia affects up to 50% of surgical patients and increases the risk of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Both preoperative anemia and perioperative RBC transfusion are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes following surgery. Preoperative treatment of anemia includes oral and intravenous (i.v.) iron and erythroid stimulating agents (ESA) such as erythropoietin (EPO); however, the optimal treatment strategy for preoperative anemia remains to be established. Our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESA and iron therapy based on their effects on the prevalence of RBC transfusions and adverse thrombotic events. Study Design/Method: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to July 2016; reference lists of published guidelines, reviews and associated papers, as well as conference proceedings. No language restrictions were applied. We included randomized controlled trials in which adult patients undergoing surgery received either an ESA and/or iron before surgery, versus iron or no intervention. Three authors independently reviewed the studies and extracted data from included trials. Risk of bias was assessed for all included studies. Where applicable, we pooled risk ratios of dichotomous outcomes and mean differences of continuous outcomes across trials using randomeffects models. Our primary outcome was the number of patients transfused with red blood cells. Secondary outcomes included risk of mortality and other thrombovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism). Results/Finding: A total of 79 randomized controlled trials (8, Conclusion: Amongst patients undergoing surgery, the administration of an ESA in addition to oral or i.v. iron was associated with a reduction in patients requiring RBC transfusion. Intravenous iron was less effective at reducing RBC transfusion. Neither treatment was associated with any clear increase in risk of adverse thrombotic events. Additional large prospective randomized controlled trials are required to determine the optimal management strategy for patients undergoing surgery with iron restricted anemia.",

No randomized prospective trial has ever demonstrated a clinical benefit for transfusion in mild to moderately anemic patients and yet there is a large body of evidence which has shown that due to a variety of reasons including an immunomodulatory effect and the storage lesion, blood transfusions can cause considerable harm, including higher risk of hospital acquired bacterial infections, transfusion related acute lung injury/acute pulmonary edema, acute myocardial infarction, higher recurrence of rebleeding and higher cancer recurrence. Study Design/Methods: A system wide goal was launched across 39 hospitals to decrease the number of PRBC transfusions given to clinically stable patients with hemoglobin (Hgb) levels >5 7.0 g/dL. The numerator consisted of all PRBC units transfused to patients with a Hgb of 7.0 g/dL or greater prior to transfusion and the denominator consisted of all PRBC units transfused. Exclusions included cardiac surgery, Nursery, NICU, pregnancy, post-partum hemorrhage, massive transfusion protocol and transfusions in which 4 or more PRBC units were transfused in one episode. Data was extracted directly from the Electronic Medical Record and hospitals received patient level detail every month for all PRBC units transfused to patients with a Hgb of 7.0 g/dL or higher prior to transfusion. An extensive educational campaign re: evidence-based transfusion practice was launched for Physicians and Nurses, including the development of a Blood Therapeutics toolkit, development of standardized Dignity Health Blood Therapeutics Guidelines, a one day Blood Therapeutics Advanced Training Symposium, on-site visits to 21 hospitals including 16 CME presentations, online Physician and Nursing educational videos, communication tools including infographics and \"7 is the new 10\" buttons, development of a patient education resource and bi-monthly webinars with various educational topics and speakers. Additionally, the EHR powerplans were revised to ensure available selections for \"Transfusion Indication\" (required field) were aligned with evidence based guidelines. Facilties were encouraged to develop multi-disciplinary Blood Therapeutics Committees to review all transfusions given to patients with pre-transfusion Hgb >5 7.0 g/dL on a routine basis, providing feedback to Providers whose transfusions were deemed not in accordance with current evidence-based guidelines. Results/Findings: From FY2015 to FYTD2017, there was a 26% reduction in PRBC units transfused to patients with Hgb >5 7.0 g/dL, starting at a baseline of 67% down to 41%. This represents an FY17 annualized savings of $9.732M, from a baseline of 82 units per 1,000 patients days down to an average 71 units and approximately 2,000 fewer units transfused per month. Conclusion: Blood transfusions, while life saving, should be regarded as an organ transplant and as such they carry considerable risk. Transfusions to stable, non-bleeding patients with Hgb levels >5 7.0 g/dL are not in accordance with evidence-based guidelines and should be avoided due to the associated potential harm. Furthermore, this potential harm is dose dependent, so if the decision to transfuse is made, one unit of PRBC should be transfused rather than two. Three AF studies (SDM5-0.258) reduced RBC units and two studies decreased the percentage of patients transfused (OR5 0.700). Forty-three studies showed that intravenous tranexamic acid reduced the percentage of patients (OR 50.264) and RBC units transfused (SDM5-0.553). Qualitative/meta-analyses were translated into recommendations by an Expert Panel and approved by the LMBP Workgroup for reducing RBC transfusion. Recommendations are: Early assessment and effective AM; RT, Hb alerts in CPOE/CDS; reduction of blood loss and AF assessing the percentage of patients and RBC units transfused across cases, physicians and service areas over discrete periods of time with feedback to physicians for continuous quality improvement. Conclusion: Conclusion: The LMBP A-6 method led to evidence-based recommendations for reducing transfusion. Critical laboratory support is needed to achieve continuous quality and patient safety. ",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Reducing the inappropriate use of blood products via the implementation of evidence based guidelines is a main tenet of patient blood management. The use of electronic decision support tools such as best practice alerts (BPAs) to enforce red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds have been shown to reduce use by informing ordering providers when or when not to transfuse. The tools in use to date have not provided a dose of RBCs to transfuse, so in fact providers can continue to over-transfusion based on the number of units of RBC given. A therapeutic hemoglobin/hematocrit (Hgb/HCT) targeted approach to RBC indications/ orders allows for the calculation of a dose of RBCs to achieve the desired target and could further reduce the use of RBC units. Our group has developed a computer algorithm to calculate RBC dose based on patient specific data drawn from the electronic medical record (EMR) that has been used in select patient populations but has not been prospectively applied to hospital wide clinical practice. This study describes our initial experience with the use of this algorithm in non-surgical RBC transfusion. Study Design/Method: The Blood Utilization Calculator (BUC) is a mathematical formula that draws patient specific information including index Hgb/ HCT and calculates a dose in number of units of RBCs to transfuse in order to achieve a selected target Hgb/HCT. Hgb/HCT target based indications for RBC transfusion were designed and used as the basis for RBC order set with in the EThe BUC was embedded within the EMRs RBC order set to provide a recommended transfusion dose in number of units when any nonsurgical RBC indication was selected. The target Hgb/HCT for these indications was 7g/dL/21% or 8g/dL/24%. The number of RBC units ordered and transfused were tracked prospectively for each of the orderable indications. Comparison of units transfused per month before and after the BUC implementation was performed using Student's t-test. Results/Finding: Historically, the three non-surgical RBC indications represented approximately 42% of the total RBC transfused. Prior to the BUC the mean number of non-surgical RBC units transfused was 590 1 24 units/ month. After the first 5 months of BUC activation the mean number of units was 439 1 50 units/month a reduction of 151 units/month or 26% of nonsurgical blood use (P50.003 by t-test). Non-surgical RBC use now represents approximately 29% of the total RBC use hospital wide a 13% reduction. This change represents a significant cost savings in RBCs over time.",

This is a review of the first 30 months. Study Design/Method: During year one PBM working group was established. Achievements included physician engagement programs, creation of transfusion committee and providing nursing education. Auditing processes were implemented with nonconformance letters sent to physicians and nurses when compliance with informed consent, transfusion tags and thresholds and discharge instructions was not achieved. In year two, IT created best practice alerts (BPA) when an order did not meet transfusion threshold criteria. BPA showed first line of associated procedure, link to the full procedure, three most recent lab results (e.g., hemoglobin & hematocrit for red blood cells (RBC)) and allowed ordering physician to cancel order after review. A blood administration video was created. It was mandatory that all physicians granted privileges complete within six months. Low vital sign compliance required action that included reducing requirement from five to three during transfusion and formation of working group (WG) to address knowledge and practice gaps. In year three, as historically at this HCS very few Jehovah's Witness patients (JWP) presented, PBM WG was involved with implementation of a bloodless medicine program. All steps of care were addressed including identifying JWP at registration, creating 115A TRANSFUSION special arm bands, forming a bloodless medicine physician group, implementing nursing BPA in the electronic medical record, creating advanced directives and marketing to the public. Results/Finding: The following were monitored for compliance (2Q14 vs. 1Q17): present and completed consents (66 vs. 94%), present and completed nursing flow sheets (19 vs. 96%), transfusion thresholds supported (73 vs. 100%), discharge instructions provided (17 vs. 86%); (3Q15 vs.1Q17) vital sign compliance (39% vs.71%). JWP increased from 27 to 225 (04/16-03/17). Cost savings were realized by decreased utilization and implementation of BPA.

Study Design/Methods: We treat approximately 30-40 trauma patients monthly. An assessment of our current blood supply chain revealed a multistep, manual process that took about 8 minutes to prepare and physically transport a cooler from the blood bank to the ED. Coolers of blood were provided for incoming trauma patients, whether they ended up needing transfusions or not. This practice worked to ensure available blood supplies during critical moments, but resulted in inefficiencies and unnecessary inventory tie-ups, with only 10 percent of coolers fully used. It also consumed valuable staff time as technologists typically made 20-45 trips per month from the blood bank to the ED. Plus, there was no effective way to maintain traceability, control access to coolers or monitor usage. Results/Findings: Since our November 2016 implementation, BloodTrack Emerge has freed up technologists to perform important tasks, tightened traceability and inventory control procedures and contributed to the Medical City Plano's verification as a Level 1 trauma center. Rather than preparing coolers of blood in case they may be needed in emergency situations, BloodTrack Emerge provides ED staff ready access to emergency units whenever they're actually needed -and frees up an estimated 6-10 hours of tech time per month during which they can perform other tasks. Audio and visual alerts notify the blood bank when emergency units are removed, allowing a quick response. Plus, by stocking emergency blood supplies in the ED, the blood bank isn't unnecessarily tying up group O RBC units. Today, the blood bank stocks and maintains 2-4 units of group O RhD negative, 4 units of O RhD positive, and 4 units of group A thawed plasma/ liquid plasma in BloodTrack Emerge. Conclusion: Implementing BloodTrack Emerge has enabled us to more effectively provide blood products for incoming trauma patients to support ratio-based transfusions, improve staff efficiencies and proactively respond to emergency situations. Background/Case Studies: Platelets are a limited resource for which the benefits of transfusion must be weighed against the risks. In 2015, the AABB published platelet transfusion guidelines to assist providers. At our academic medical center, a computer provider order entry (CPOE) system combines institutional transfusion guidelines with a patient's most recent lab results to guide transfusion decisions. Discordant information activates an \"override\" system, in which providers are prompted to select a prefixed indication for transfusion (e.g. Count < 10 K/ml [prophylaxis]) with the option to add a free-text comment. The order is placed and data is stored for later review. Study Design/Method: Override platelet orders placed from June 2015-October 2016 were reviewed using the following data: prefixed indication, most recent platelet count, free-text comment, and ordering service/department. One of five \"codes\" was assigned to each order: I-Indicated or NI-Not indicated (based on institutional/AABB guidelines); NMI-Need more information; P-Protocol (e.g. liver transplant), and NIC-Non-indication comments (e.g. reserve for OR). Free-text comments were categorized and assigned one or more keywords in order to determine the common reasons for overrides. Results/Finding: Over a 17-month period, 1,270 CPOE override platelet orders occurred. The percentages of code assignments by month are provided in Table 01 below. Overall, 532 (42%) were assigned as not indicated (NI).",

Certain platelet count goals and reasons for transfusion (e.g. \"downtrend,\" \"anticipate drop,\" or \"per service,\") are not included in institutional or AABB guidelines. Of note, 618 (49%) of overrides were placed by Hematology-Oncology providers. Conclusion: A majority of override platelet orders were determined to not be indicated based on institutional and AABB guidelines. Of concern were keywords such as \"downtrend\" and \"anticipate drop,\" as these are not indications for transfusion and expose patients to unnecessary transfusions. It is unclear whether trainee progression throughout the year had any effects on ordering practices and associated override patterns. This review suggests the potential benefits of provider education initiatives at all levels of experience (with particular emphasis on Hematology-Oncology) in order to improve blood product utilization practices. Background/Case Studies: early diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) by clinical laboratories (CL), with effective prevention and treatment in primary care may have an impact on packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion, as well as intravenous iron therapy and, most importantly, applying lower transfusion triggers. They all help to avoid not essential transfusions, but also promote health and wellbeing by improving iron status in the population. Results are described after implementing a process to prevent IDA, its early detection and treatment for years 2014-2016. Study Design/Methods: performance measure after educational and organizational intervention. Setting: public integrated healthcare system located in north Africa bordering Morocco, isolated by 207 km sea distance to nearest continental Spain airport, with a general hospital blood transfusion service and a establishment for blood donation and component production. CL involved in anemia detection and diagnosis receives four primary care centers and hospital based samples, and shares common leadership with both blood establishments. Process: guidelines for first step CL diagnosis of IDA and call for attention, primary oral iron prevention and treatment in first level care, and early intravenous iron complex for inpatients (sucrose) and outpatients (carboxymaltose). Transfusion was avoided for stable IDA patients without active bleeding or coronary heart disease, with a safety hemoglobin (Hb) threshold of 5,5g/dl. Severely anemic patients were closely followed to asses Hb increase and referred for etiology studies when Hb> 9 g/dl. Background/Case Studies: Bedside nurses are critical in safeguarding the delivery of appropriate patient care. More recently, nurses have also begun to play an important role in patient blood management (PBM) programs at the administrative level, although to our knowledge little has been published on the influence nurses may have on transfusion practice at the bedside. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact nurses have on patient expectations and physician ordering practice. Study Design/Method: A short electronic survey (12 questions) was prepared to assess how often bedside nurses discussed transfusion necessity and the persons (patient or physician) with whom they discussed it with, as well as what was discussed, and what they felt were appropriate lab thresholds for transfusion. The survey was distributed to all registered nurses via email from floor leaders. Responses were also solicited by hospital volunteers and lab staff with electronic tablets and included coverage of the night shift.",

Ninety percent stated they discussed transfusion necessity with patients, 81% with physicians, and of these, 59% reported doing so proactively before an order was placed. Ninety-six percent said they would discuss transfusion to suggest their patient required a blood product; only 3% responded that they would suggest product was not needed. Nursing perception of acceptable transfusion thresholds had a wider distribution, with the most commonly reported values being hemoglobin of 7-8 g/dL (56%), platelet count of 20-50,000 (38%), and INR of greater than 2.0 (69%).",

The limited number of survey responses suggests a discomfort with their level of education in transfusion practice. This, along with the distribution of perceived thresholds and the reluctance to recommend against transfusions, presents an opportunity for education to further empower nurses in providing appropriate patient care within the guidelines of PBM programs. Background/Case Studies: The use of red blood cell per 1,000 inhabitants may vary 3 folds between European countries, revealing that there may be substantial room for blood optimization strategies. Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach aiming to preserve and optimise patients' own blood in order to improve clinical outcomes.

Adaptive conjoint analysis techniques were used to elicit KOL preferences. In the second phase a decision analysis model was used to estimate the impact of PBM implementation in the following therapeutic areas: surgery (orthopaedic, cardiac and urologic), cardiology, oncology, gastrointestinal bleeding, abnormal uterine bleeding, haemodialysis, inflammatory bowel disease and pregnancy. Model inputs included effectiveness data regarding transfusion utilization, health resource consumption and mortality obtained from Portuguese national health databases and literature review. The public health value of PBM implementation in Portugal derives from the comparison of two scenarios: \"current clinical practice\" and \"with PBM implementation\". Results/Finding: KOL elicited iron administration followed by restrictive transfusion of red blood cell as the most preferred PBM strategies (14.4% and 14.0%), for the remaining strategies weights varied between 7.0% and 10.6%. We estimate that 384,704 patients would be eligible for PBM strategies in one year time horizon, resulting in 594 premature death avoided (3.8% reduction) corresponding to a gain of approximately 1,500 life years and a reduction of 3,660 (6.0%) disability adjusted life years (DALY) relative to the current clinical practice. A decrease of 233,141 in-hospital days is expected mainly due to a 8.4% reduction in hospital length of stay and a 37.3% reduction in 30-day readmission rate. In this population the overall transfusion rate could decrease to 4.3% from the current 8.7% (51.2% reduction) implying 17,202 blood transfusion avoided and 65,214 red blood cells units spared.",

            "text": "Review of Blood Ordering Practice for Elective Surgeries in a Maternity Hospital Qi Raymond Fu*. KK Women's and Children's Hospital Background/Case Studies: Pre-operative over-ordering of blood is common, resulting in waste of blood bank resources. Blood units are withdrawn from the pool, leading to constraints in allocating the limited blood resources to meet the needs of other patients. The Cross-match to Transfusion (CT) ratio is often used in benchmarking efficient blood utilization within the hospital blood transfusion service. According to the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), a CT ratio of less than 2.0 is favorable, and anything above indicates over-ordering and cross-matching of blood. To achieve this, it is necessary to review pre-surgical blood ordering practice in a maternity hospital. Study Design/Methods: Data on elective surgeries requiring blood for standby was collected retrospectively over a 3 month period (Jan to Mar 2017). Details of total blood cross-matched, issued, transfused and returned were analyzed along with the CT ratio. Results/Findings: During the 3 month period, there were 274 patients undergoing obstetrics and gynecology procedures requiring blood on standby. A total of 494 units of blood were requested. 154 units were crossmatched, of which 138 units were sent to the Operating Theatre (OT). Only 33.3% of blood issued to OT were transfused (n546) while the rest were unutilized. The observed CT ratio was 3.35. Conclusion: Although only 31% of total blood requested was crossmatched, the CT ratio remains above the recommended guideline of !2.0, with almost 70% of cross-matched blood unutilized. There is a need to improve and standardize the blood ordering practice to achieve costeffectiveness and reduce unnecessary workload. Establishing and adhering to a maximum surgical blood order schedule (MSBOS) could help in conserving blood and prevent over-ordering of blood. Background/Case Studies: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a major orthopaedic procedure with increased perioperative blood loss. This perioperative blood loss could be more significant in patients undergoing bilateral TKA in a single stage. The increased blood loss in bilateral TKA often requires blood transfusion which results in high post-operative morbidities. Study Design/Methods: In this retrospective study 35 patients who received tranexamic acid (TXA) (study group) and 31 patients who did not receive TXA during surgery (control) were evaluated for blood loss and transfusion requirement. The study group received a single bolus dose of TXA 1gm IV before tourniquet deflation on first side knee. Statistical Background/Case Studies: Blood product utilization is an increasing concern for hospital systems attempting to reduce transfusion-associated risks. One strategy to optimize utilization is to employ clinical decision support in the form of alerts to clinicians ordering blood products. We investigated whether an alert targeted to a patient's transfusion indication could alter provider ordering behavior. Study Design/Method: This retrospective, observational study over the course of seven months included the inpatient adult medicine floors and intensive care units at a large academic hospital. Each time a crossmatch for packed red blood cells (pRBCs) was ordered via the hospital's electronic ordering system, an indication (e.g. \"hemodynamically stable with hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL\") must be selected. If the indication selected contains a threshold hemoglobin concentration, and the patient's most recent hemoglobin on record was greater than this threshold, an interruptive alert displaying the patient's hemoglobin was activated. Ordering providers were then given three options: cancel the order, select a more appropriate indication from a list, or provide an explanation via free text as to why transfusion was being requested outside of approved indications. An alert encounter was defined as all activations on a patient within a six hour period without an intervening transfusion Results/Finding: Over seven months, there were 1732 unique alert encounters. Of these, 1531 (88.4%) led to a crossmatch being ordered while 201 (11.6%) led to the order being canceled. Providers were more likely to cancel transfusions in response to alerts for hemodynamically stable patients with lower hemoglobin thresholds (7.0 g/dL) than for more complicated patients (bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or preoperative) with higher hemoglobin thresholds (8.0 or 9.0 g/dL Background/Case Studies: The maximum surgical blood ordering schedule (MSBOS) is a list of surgical procedures performed along with a recommendation for the extent of pre-transfusion testing to be completed before the surgery begins. With improved patient data management systems it is now possible to create an MSBOS based on actual red blood cell (RBC) utilization data on a per-patient basis. This study investigated the transfusion patterns at 4 academic hospitals with data-derived MSBOS. Study Design/Method: The 4 hospitals were in 2 groups, with one shared MSBOS for each group. Three of these hospitals were large academic centers while one was a children's hospital. At each center the MSBOS recommended no pre-transfusion testing if 5% of patients had been transfused for a specific procedure in the previous year, a pre-operative type and screen (T&S) if 5-24% of the patients had been transfused, and a crossmatch of the median number of RBCs transfused if !25% of the patients had been transfused. Data were collected at each center over a 1 month period between January to March 2017 and included a maximum of 400 cases per hospital during that one month to ensure equal representation between centers Results/Finding: Between these 4 centers there were a total of 1599 cases analyzed. Some of the more frequently performed surgeries included orthopedics (23% of cases), general surgery (16%) and cardiac surgery (11%). There were 1362 T&S ordered for these cases, of which 5 were positive for antibodies on the day of surgery. Of all the T&S ordered, 52% were ordered in accord with the MSBOS recommendation, 26% were ordered when the MSBOS did not recommend one, and in 0.2% a T&S was not ordered when the MSBOS recommended one.

We therefore analyzed the etiology and characteristics of antenatal anemia according to HIV status at a large hospital with a HIV prevalence of 29% among obstetric patients. Study Design/Method: We studied a sample of anemic (Hgb<10.0 g/dL) pregnant women who were referred to an antenatal anemia clinic at a large hospital in South Africa. Clinical information was abstracted and blood was sent for laboratory studies. T-tests were used to compare continuous variables between groups. Results/Findings: A total of 301 women were enrolled, with median age 27 (interquartile range 23-32) years, median gravida 2 / para 1 and median gestational age 28 weeks. Mean Hgb before referral was 7.5 g/dL and most were already taking oral iron therapy.

Compared to HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women had evidence of increased inflammation, relatively little differences in iron studies after early treatment with iron and lower red cell folate. A high proportion of HIV positive women were receiving ART, consistent with national guidelines. Future studies will examine longer-term responses to iron therapy to assess its potential in decreasing the incidence of peripartum blood transfusion. Background/Case Studies: A 2 month old boy presented to our institution after a 1 month hospitalization in Japan. He was admitted there, several weeks after his unremarkable term birth to an AB Rh positive woman, with lethargy, failure to thrive, bloody mucoid stools with eosinophilia, and an elevated serum white count. He was found to be anemic and thrombocytopenic and required multiple transfusions. Also, he had a diffuse, scaling, erythematous rash over his inner thighs. Study Design/Method: Initial workup was suspicous for an allergic/necrotizing enterocolitis. The patient had an elevated LDH and potassium, and concern was raised for leukemia with possible tumor lysis syndrome. A sample sent to our blood bank showed an anti-E, with a positive DAT (IgG and complement), and was positive for E, e, and C antigens. Concern for a maternally-induced antibody was raised, as was the possibility of a red cell antigen passively transfused from blood products administered at the Japanese hospital; both possibilities were excluded. Further workup revealed no infection or hematologic proliferation. Biopsy of his rash showed spongiotic dermatitis. His clinical course deteriorated, and he developed hepatomegaly and jaundice. A concern for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome was raised, and workup showed normal immunoglobulin levels, but with elevated IgE (15270 kU/L; RR: 0-2.9). Anti-platelet antibodies were identified. Three days after admission, testing was sent for genetic alterations of FOXP3, while a Japanese-speaking physician at our institution read a prior flow cytometry study showing a deficiency of FOXP31 CD41 lymphocytes. The majority of these indications are seen in adults and for which a reported plasma wastage is $1.8%. Fortunately in pediatrics the incidence of these indications is low despite the heterogeneity of the patient population. During the utilization review process at our primary pediatric institution, we noted a mean wastage of 8.2% over the last 5 years. With recent changes in clinical practice (liver transplants and increased trauma) and recent evidence that faster plasma improves massive transfusion protocol (MTP) outcomes, our facility decided to implement the use of thawed plasma and benchmark MTP plasma wastage. Study Design/Method: Blood Utilization Review revealed an increase in the overall percentage of plasma wastage from 2014 to 2016, with a peak of 11.6% (range 3.2%-11.6%). A single cause could not be readily identified prompting us to query Children's Hospital Association (CHA), as our initial external pediatric benchmarking, to determine if our wastage was comparable to other children's hospitals in addition to reviewing our \"time of plasma availability\" for 2016 MTPS. Results/Finding: In 2016, MTP was activated 28 times. In 6 cases the patient did not receive any blood product and in 11 cases plasma was already available at the time of RBC allocation/issue. This left 11 cases to evaluate. The median time to plasma availability was 29 minutes (range 4 minutes -61 minutes). The mean plasma wastage for MTP activations was 32% (range 0-100%). Of the 9 CHA replies, 3 were using thawed plasma and their wastage was </5 5%. Conclusion: Increasing clinical evidence supports the prompt transfusion of plasma in the setting of MTP to decrease morbidity and mortality. Our brief review suggests that implementing thawed plasma will allow a potential decrease in plasma availability of 29 minutes. Our implementation began with thawing a single unit of plasma for \"Level 1 Neuro Trauma\" alerts, and we are now keeping a single unit of AB plasma thawed at all times. Plasma is now available at the same time as RBCs thus providing more effective and balanced blood product support while reducing wastage (preliminary estimates are 9.5 %) to a level consistent with external benchmarking. Prospective evaluation of this practice is ongoing at our institution and includes collaborative clinical assessment with the Trauma Team. Ultimately prospective, multi-institutional studies in pediatric institutions are necessary to define best clinical practice and effectively benchmark blood bank practice. Background/Case Studies: Bacterial and fungal infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in severely neutropenic patients with hematological disease receiving high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Granulocyte transfusions (GTx) have been used for over 40 years, although effectiveness, indications, and both patient and donor safety remain debated, particularly in children. To contribute to this discussion we demonstrated 5 cases of GTx in pediatric patients with age from 8 months to 16 years old, neutropenic, with severe infection resistant to antibiotics and/or antifungal therapy, undergoing HSCT and chemotherapy. Study Design/Method: Donors: Data concerning a total of 56 granulocytes donations from 2015 to 2016 were collected from 43 health donors (21 male/ 22 female). Donors had matched blood type and serology status for cytomegalovirus when the patient was negative. Granulocytes were mobilized with a single dose of rHu-G-CSF (Filgrastim) subcutaneously, 5mcg/kg/dose (donors up to 70kg, maximum of 600mcg) and oral dexamethasone (8mg), 12h prior to apheresis. Apheresis was performed using Cobe Spectra V R or Spectra Optia V R with citrate as anticoagulant. All products were irradiated with 40Gy. Results/Finding s: Granulocytes number increased 5 times from basal levels and the median of cells collected were 4.89 x10 10 (range 1.09-9.85). In general donors reported no significant adverse reactions. From 56 donations, only in 4 was reported light paresthesia during the procedure. Patients: All patients were medicated prior to transfusions with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen. The product was transfused within 24 hours after collection, with efforts to transfuse as soon as possible. Details about the transfusions are described on Table 1 . Adverse reactions for patients were minor and not frequent (4 in 66 GTx) including vomiting, hypotension and headache, which resolved without serious or lasting complications, assuming that GTx is well tolerated. Conclusion: Our study provides further evidence that GTx transfusions can be safely performed on pediatric patients.",

The mean total WBC in the collected product and the mean volume of treated blood from men and women were significantly different. Perhaps the reason for lower cell products from women is to treat smaller blood volume. The lack of increment WBC after transfusion is not equivalent to lack of its efficacy. We found a significant association between transfused dose and increment of WBC. We deliberately did not estimate our data on the treatment of patients with sepsis and other severe infections between patients receiving and not receiving granulocyte transfusions because the need for transfusions of granulocytes indicates more severe patients, when they have infections in a neutropenia or dysfunction of the immune system, and refractory to antibiotics CP150 Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn Due to Anti-Rh17 Keegan Barry-Holson* 1 and Jennifer Andrews 2 . 1 Stanford University, Dept of Pathology, 2 Stanford University, Dept of Pathology & Pediatrics Background/Case Studies: Anti-Rh17 is a rare antibody against a high incidence red blood cell (RBC) antigen (Ag) present in people with common Rh phenotypes. This Ag is missing in individuals who are Rh null or have Rh deletion phenotypes, including D--/D--. D--individuals strongly express D and lack C, c, E, and e Ags. The clinical relevance of anti-RH17 has primarily been reported in pregnant women, causing mild to fatal hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). We present a rare case of HDN due to anti-Rh17 alloimmunization during pregnancy in a D--mother. Study Design/Methods: An O-positive full term infant was born to an Opositive G3P1 > 2 mother with a negative 1 st trimester antibody screen and no prior transfusions. She had two prior pregnancies, the first resulted in a normal term singleton, and the second resulted in a spontaneous miscarriage during the 1 st trimester. Father's blood type is unknown but presumably he has Rh antigens. The infant was transferred to our institution at 6 hours of life because he was found to have anemia (hemoglobin 12.0 g/dL), severe hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin (t Bili) 9.0 mg/dL), reticulocytosis (8%) and a positive direct antiglobulin test (IgG 21). He was admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit for potential need for exchange transfusion given concern for HDN. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and triple phototherapy on the day of admission, temporarily blunting his hemolysis. T bili rose to a maximum of 16.7mg/dL on day 8 of life and phototherapy was restarted. His t bili subsequently stabilized and he was discharged home and followed in clinic. Meanwhile, his mother donated blood given there were no compatible red blood cells available in the United States via rare donor query. Nine days after discharge, he was readmitted for worsening anemia (hemoglobin 6.3 g/dL) and was given steroids and washed maternal red blood cells. He was discharged and followed in clinic for several months with ultimate resolution of his anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Results/Findings: At delivery, the mother's antibody screen was positive and anti-Rh17 was identified; no other alloantibodies were detected. Antibody identification was performed using polyethylene glycol, low ionic strength solution and ficin enhancement. Maternal serum was pan reactive against panel cells and non-reactive against D--cells. Anti-Rh17 sera did not react against maternal RBCs. Phenotyping of the mother revealed that she was D1 C-E-c-e-. Molecular testing confirmed her D--genotype; Molecular BeadChip Test yielded no type due to low signal for e, E, V and VS Ags. Genotyping for Rh variant and targeted genomic RHCE testing failed to detect several RHCE exons. Father was unavailable for further testing. Conclusion: We report a rare case of HDN due to anti-Rh17 antibody in a D --mother. We hope to obtain further laboratory studies in maternal relatives given the rarity of this phenotype in the general population. These studies have important implications for genetic counseling for mother's sisters.",

To our knowledge, this is the first case report in which an infant with severe AIHA has been successfully treated with manual WBEX in an acute care setting. Study Design/Methods: Case report format. Results/Findings: A 2 month-old previously healthy female patient presented to the emergency department with hemodynamic instability and a nadir hemoglobin (Hb)/hematocrit (Hct) of 1.6 g/dL/4.9%. WBC counts (19 x 10 9 /L) were mildly elevated and platelet counts (410 x 10 9 /L) were within normal limits. Her history was notable for upper respiratory tract infection 6 days prior to the onset of anemia. Laboratory studies on admission showed hyperbilirubinemia (total 7.1 mg/dL, direct 1.4 mg/dL), normal LDH (318 U/L), and undetectable haptoglobin (<7 mg/dL) indicative of ongoing hemolysis. Clinical symptoms included diffuse jaundice, hemoglobinuria, lethargy, and emesis. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management, including right internal jugular central venous catheter placement due to poor peripheral vascular access. The patient's blood group was O, Rh (D)-negative with a positive antibody screen and panel demonstrating a strong panagglutinin (3-41 reactivity) with positive autocontrol. DAT was 41 positive for anti-IgG and negative for C3 despite a positive cold antibody screen.",

            "text": "The patient weighed 6.9 kg with an estimated total blood volume of 620 mL. She initially received simple transfusions totaling 20 mL/kg of least incompatible group O Rh(D)-negative RBCs with no incremental response. Manual WBEX was then performed with 463 mL of reconstituted whole blood consisting of O, Rh(D)-negative RBCs and AB fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to an Hct of 40%, utilizing the central venous catheter. No adverse events took place over the course of the 2 hour exchange. Her one hour post-exchange Hb was 9.5 g/ dL and a subsequent antibody screen demonstrated reduced intensity of the panagglutinin (21). After initiation of steroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 2 mg/kg/day), she continued to improve clinically. One week later, the patient was discharged home with a Hb of 11 g/dL. One month later, she experienced recurrent hemolysis requiring re-hospitalization, at which time she had normal IgM and IgA levels with markedly elevated IgG levels (3168 mg/dL). At a subsequent follow-up visit 3 months after her initial presentation, her anemia had resolved and she had been completely weaned off steroids. Conclusion: We demonstrate a case of severe neonatal AIHA successfully treated with manual WBEX. The main advantages of WBEX include removal of both autologous RBCs and plasma as well as infusion of allogeneic RBCs. In this case, manual exchange transfusion avoided the need for an automated apheresis procedure requiring citrate anticoagulation. In summary, manual WBEX is a potentially safe procedure that may be performed in young children with severe AIHA. ABSTRACT operating room, each experienced blood-colored urine, laboratory evidence of hemolysis, and acute kidney injury. Clerical and serologic investigations revealed no cause for hemolysis. Mechanical hemolysis from transfusion rate, catheter gauge, or a recently introduced one-way valve was considered. Study Design/Methods: In vitro simulated transfusions were performed via syringe. Measurements included hematocrit (Hct), free hemoglobin, and visual hemolysis index. Washed and unwashed red blood cells (RBCs) were tested with or without a one-way valve, using a 24 or 16 gauge (G) intravenous (IV) catheter. Each one-way valve was used to test three identical samples. Constant pressure was applied manually (rapidly, 1.431/-0.49 ml/ second) or with a mechanical syringe pump (slowly, 2 ml/min). A subset of the manual transfusions was timed. Control samples for baseline measurements were collected by gravity drip, without passing through the one-way valve or catheter. Results/Findings: The one-way valve increased hemolysis markedly during rapid transfusion using both catheters as well as both washed and unwashed RBCs (see Table) . With the 24G catheter, the mean change in Hct was -3.531/-0.69% with the one-way valve and 0.221/-0.13% without (p<0.00001). Comparing the one-way valves tested, differences in hemolysis were observed (change in Hct; p<0.0001). During rapid manual transfusion with a 24G catheter and unwashed RBCs, hemolysis was greater for samples that took longer to transfuse 4.5ml when using a one-way valve (change in Hct versus time: r5-0.75, p<0.0001) compared to a significantly different (p50.0085) slight increase in hemolysis for samples that took less time to transfuse 4.5ml when not using a one-way valve (change in Hct versus time: r50.58, p50.23). Correlations between time and hemolysis were similar, but insignificant using 24G with washed RBCs and the 16G IV catheter. Conclusion: Mechanical hemolysis should be considered when investigating possible hemolytic transfusion reactions, especially with high rates of transfusion and use of a one-way valve. During rapid manual transfusion with the one-way valve, greater resistance was associated with increased hemolysis. Background/Case Studies: Gerbich (Ge) antigens expressed on glycophorin C are present in 99.9% of the population. Ge antibodies cause delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Ge antibodies also suppress erythropoiesis resulting in late-onset anemia. We report a case of HDFN due to anti-Ge3. Study Design/Methods: A woman of Paraguayan origin with prior terminated pregnancies presented at 24 weeks gestation with passive anti-D and an anti-Ge3 titer of 256. She was D-and GE:-2,-3, 4 by antigen typing. Her obstetrician scheduled maternal blood collection near her due date for possible neonatal transfusion, but the woman went into labor at 37 weeks. Cord blood was DAT positive for IgG; the eluate confirmed anti-D and anti-Ge3. The birth hemoglobin (Hgb) was 12.6 g/dL, reticulocyte (retic) was 8.6%, bilirubin (bili) was 2.8 mg/dL; the infant was discharged. On day 7 of life, the infant was referred to Pediatric Hematology for lethargy and poor feeding, with Hgb 7.6 g/dL, retic 2.6%, and bili 6.6 mg/dL. Ge3-blood was not available from the blood center or rare donor registry. The mother was B Rh-and baby was B Rh1. Obstetrics had to authorize maternal blood donation due to her Hgb of 10.9 g/dL. Maternal blood collection and RBC washing was expedited and the infant received 40mL of maternal RBCs within 24 hours, at which time his Hgb was 6.1 g/dL. Post-transfusion Hgb was 10.8 g/dL. One week later, the infant was symptomatic with Hgb 7.1 g/dL, retic 1.0%, bili 2.1 mg/dL. A 2 nd aliquot of 60mL washed maternal cells was transfused. Two weeks thereafter, the infant had Hgb 7.8 g/dL, retic 0.7%, anti-Ge3 titer 8, and needed another transfusion. The maternal blood stored for just 3 weeks had hemolyzed necessitating a 2nd maternal donation for baby's 3 rd transfusion. At 6 weeks, the infant's anti-Ge3 titer was 2, Hgb 9.2 g/dL, retic 1.7%; no transfusion was necessary. At 8 weeks of life, Hgb was 10.2 g/dL, retic was 3.3%, and the baby was thriving. Results/Findings: Serologic studies at the hospital and reference blood center confirmed the antibodies and risk of anti-Ge3 HDFN. Molecular analysis revealed that the mother was homozygous Ge3-negative GE*01.-03, the father had homozygous wild type GE*01, and the infant was heterozygous GE*01/GE*01.-03. Conclusion: The infant had HDFN due to antibodies to the high prevalence Ge3 antigen. The continued need for transfusion was consistent with hemolysis and suppression of erythrocyte production caused by anti-Ge3. Hemolysis of stored maternal blood was consistent with the absence of glycophorin C. This case demonstrates that cooperative multidisciplinary care among the blood bank, donor center, obstetrics, and hematology in a rare case of HDFN resulted in a successful neonatal outcome. Background/Case Studies: Patient blood management is a collaborative approach to optimize transfusion therapies to improve patient outcomes. In pediatrics, blood management is not 'one size fits all' given the paucity of clinical trials to guide evidence-based practice. In addition, pediatric care encompasses a very heterogeneous patient population such that applying one set of guidelines is difficult.",

            "text": "Because there are no standard, evidence-based clinical best practices regarding blood product usage in all children, unnecessary variation is occurring at our institution. We designed a robust analytics process to study baseline clinical practice and examine blood product usage, and plan to target the three pediatric sub-specialties with highest usage to establish standards in order to decrease variation/unnecessary transfusions. Study Design/Methods: A data base encompassing all admissions and outpatient visits to a large, tertiary care academic children's and women's hospital was established, and included all relevant patient demographics, diagnostic and procedural codes, attending physician and specialty for each visit/admission, relevant hematology/coagulation laboratory results and blood product orders. We focused on RBC orders given the TRIPICU randomized clinical trial results (1) supporting a hemoglobin trigger of 7 g/dL in stable critically ill children and FFP since anecdotally we noted many children receiving this product for only minimally elevated international normalized ratio (INR) values without bleeding. Results/Findings: In 2016, 14, 247 RBC orders occurred and the top three patient groups were: 34% in congenital heart disease patients, 25% in hematology/oncology patients and 14% in neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Average hemoglobin of every patient was 9.85 g/dL as measured in the 72 hours prior to RBC order placement. In 2016, 3105 FFP orders occurred and the top three patient groups were: 46% in neonates in the NICU, 28% in congenital heart disease patients and 13% in pediatric intensive care patients. Average INR of every patient was 2.09 as measured in the 72 hours prior to FFP order placement. Conclusion: We have designed a robust data base that is continually updated for children in a large, tertiary care academic children's hospital. This serves as an important benchmark in pediatric blood utilization, and we plan to leverage usage patterns to make relevant practice changes in the care of children with a heterogeneous set of illnesses. Background/Case Studies: Bacterial contamination of PLTs remains an ongoing threat to transfusion recipients. Recently, a psoralen-based PR technology that reduces the replication potential of pathogens in stored PLTs was FDA approved. We describe our approach to phasing PR-PLTs into our inventory, including preliminary results of an ongoing QA study of neonatal and pediatric (PEDS) recipients of PR-PLTs. Study Design/Methods: Before the arrival of PR-PLT, we undertook an educational campaign for hospital administrators, IT staff, laboratory staff, clerical/clinical aides, nurses, and physicians. We also contacted risk management and the hospital ethics committee. Phototherapy devices used at our hospital were confirmed to be compatible with the psoralen-based PR-PLT product. Shortly following the arrival of PR-PLT, we introduced day 5 bacterial \"safety measure\" testing of our conventional (C-PLT) supply. A PEDS QA study monitored PLT utilization and adverse transfusion event reporting relating to both PR-and C-PLT transfusions. This study evaluated neonates (0-4 months of age), infants (>4-12 months of age) and children (>12 months-18 years of age) who received at least one transfusion of PR-PLTs.",

            "text": "Results/Findings: Risk management and the ethics committee agreed that both PR-PLTs and bacteria tested C-PLTs would be the hospital standard of care. PR-PLTs were phased in and transfused to patients based on ABO compatibility and expiration date, per routine, without regard for patient age or medical condition. After 4 months, PR-PLT represented 30% of our platelet inventory (average daily PLT inventory: 45 units). We encountered no complications with the PR platelet phase-in, either from a clinical, informatics or logistical perspective. Due to the dual inventory, many PEDS patients in all age groups were transfused with both PR-and C-PLTs (Table) . Two potential transfusion reactions (TRs) were reported over the study period in teenage recipients, one associated with a C-PLT and the other with a PR-PLT. In both cases, the symptoms were ultimately attributed to an underlying medical condition. No rashes were observed among 16 transfused neonates (0-4 m) who received any PR-PLTs and phototherapy. Background/Case Studies: Packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions are believed to improve oxygen delivery particularly in vulnerable patients such as neonates and children. However, evidence shows that hemoglobin (Hgb) in PRBCs has increased oxygen affinity and thus reduced oxygen delivery to tissues due to decreased 2,3 DPG levels. Standardization of PRBC transfusion practices in this population and the scientific evidence on which current practice is based is limited. Additionally, due to small transfusion volumes, infants may be exposed to multiple blood donors, increasing their potential for adverse events. Study Design/Method: Medical records of 60 pediatric patients receiving PRBC transfusion over a 12 month period were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 44 patients were identified as receiving allogeneic PRBC transfusion. 16 patients who received autologous blood (cell salvage) were excluded. Patient characteristics, length of stay, PRBC transfusion volume, pre-and post-transfusion Hgb, and adverse events were collected. Results/Finding: The average pre-transfusion Hgb was 10.6 g/dL with post-transfusion Hgb rising to 14.5 g/dL. The mean PRBC volume transfused was 46.3 mL using a dose of 15mL/kg for all patients. Complications noted were; volume overload, thrombosis, fever/infection, hemolysis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and death (Table) . Conclusion: Evidence based transfusion guidelines are lacking in neonates and infants. A typical dose of 10-15 mL/kg in a 2 kg patient, for instance, would translate into 3 full PRBC units (about 1000 mL) in an average size adult. The current standard dose of 10-15 mL/kg yields very high increases in Hgb and may put these patients at risk of adverse outcomes, especially thrombosis due to increased blood viscosity. Additionally, many of these patients received volume reduced products which delivers a higher Hgb concentration per transfusion. Dosing should be based on goal Hgb and patient condition rather than weight based, though the hematocrit level at which the benefits outweigh the risks remains unclear. pneumoniae has rarely been associated with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, with only 3 case reports suggesting this association. However, each of these cases is confounded by other findings in addition to a Mycoplasma infection. We describe a unique case in which a pediatric patient has clear evidence of severe hemolysis, a very strongly reactive warm autoantibody, and clinical and laboratory evidence of a Mycoplasma infection without a detectable cold agglutinin. Study Design/Methods: The patient is a 7month-old, previously healthy female infant who presented to the hospital with a 1-week history of fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, and pallor. She was only treated with acetaminophen. She also developed clear rhinorrhea the day before hospital admission. At the time of her admission, laboratory testing (outside hospital) revealed a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 2.7 g/dL and 9.1%, respectively, platelets of 635,000, and a reticulocyte count of 10.3%. All other elements of the complete blood count were within the normal reference range for age. A complete metabolic panel revealed no abnormalities except for a total bilirubin of 4.9 mg/dL with a direct fraction of 0.43 mg/dL. A FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics; Salt Lake City, UT) detected Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while all other pathogens (19 total) were non-detectable. The patient was started on a 5-day course of azithromycin (Zithromax). Results/Findings: Prior to RBC transfusion, blood bank evaluation revealed that the patient was O-positive and had a stronglyreactive antibody screen. Further testing demonstrated an antibody reactive with all reagent red blood cells. The DAT was strongly reactive for IgG but very weakly reactive for C3. An eluate was reactive with all reagent red cells tested. Finally, a cold agglutinin study was negative with undiluted serum. In addition to starting azithromycin, the patient was given IV methylprednisolone. During her 8-day hospital course, the patient received 2 RBC transfusions on the day of admission and several RBC transfusions thereafter (see Table 1 ). Despite transfusion, her hemolytic process persisted, so she was infused with a dose of IV immunoglobulin on hospital day 6. Her hemoglobin rose to 8.4 g/dL on hospital day 7 and increased to 9.5 g/dL on hospital day 8. At that time, the patient was discharged from the hospital with instructions to wean her oral steroid dose over the next 2 weeks. She was followed closely by the hematology clinic and was found to have a stable hemoglobin (up to 11.2 g/dL on day 57 after her hospital admission) with no recurrence of her hemolytic process. Conclusion: M. pneumoniae infection is a typical cause of CAD and has only rarely been associated with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Our case demonstrates clear evidence of severe warm autoimmune hemolysis in a previously healthy infant. With the increasing use of multiplex respiratory viral and bacterial pathogen detection systems, the once rare phenomenon of a M. pneumoniae infection associated with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia may become a more recognized entity. ) and may serve to more reliably reflect when the neonates at risk for hyperbilirubinemia. The difficulty in eliminating the cord blood testing is the neonatologists' reliance of using ABO incompatibility as part of the neonates risk assessment rather than using the point of care bilirubin testing. Currently the TS requires all positive DAT tests to be communicated to the nursing staff immediately. Given that the DAT strength positively correlates with the percentage of neonates diagnosed with hyperbilirubinemia, the TS staff may also consider notifying nursing staff only for those patients whose DAT is 3 or 41.",

This work was sponsored by National Science Foundation of China (81401732) Background/Case Studies: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by severely reduced activity of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) as well as immunosuppression minimize the morbidity and potential mortality of this presentation. Absolute Immature platelet counts (A-IPC) have been shown to help diagnose and follow TTP patients' responses to therapy. We report the case of a man with relapsing TTP, low ADAMTS13 with high inhibitor, treated with mycophenolate mofetil in which A-IPC-indicated an unexpected response to therapy. Study Design/Method: A 56 year old male with a 7-year history of TTP, presented with status epilepticus complicated by acute respiratory failure admitted with suspicion for relapsing TTP. Patient had been treated in prior admissions with TPE, prednisolone, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide with clinical improvement. He was on mycophenolate mofetil maintenance therapy which he last received just prior to day of admission due to consistently low platelet counts, ADAMTS13 <5% and inhibitor of 3.6. On day of admission platelet count was 95 x 10 9 /L which decreased within five days to 14 x 10 9 /L leading to initiation of daily TPE along with mycophenolate mofetil discontinuation just prior to TPE start. Immature platelet fraction (%-IPF) and calculated A-IPC (%-IPF x platelet count) were obtained with daily pre-TPE CBC. A-IPC ratio was calculated from baseline. ABSTRACT Results/Finding: A-IPC and platelet count were 1 x 10 9 /L and 14 x 10 9 /L respectively. Counts improved rapidly post-TPE initiation and after one TPE his A-IPC tripled to 3.2 x 10 9 /L achieving the ratio of 3 previously shown to be diagnostic of TTP. On day 5 his A-IPC and platelet counts had improved to 7.5 x 10 9 /L and 218 x 10 9 /L respectively. Absence of anti-PF4 antibodies ruled out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia at this time. On day 6 he had an unexpected decrease in both A-IPC and platelet count to 4.8 x 10 9 /L and 132 x 10 9 /L respectively, worsening by day 8 to 1.7 x 10 9 /L and 40 x 10 9 /L respectively despite daily TPE. Patient received 25 additional TPEs that failed to improve A-IPC or platelets which on day 32 were 0.4 x 10 9 /L and 13 x 10 9 /L respectively. A-IPC had remained at this level for 16 days suggesting that the observed decrease was irreversible. ADAMTS13 activity remained <5% low with a high inhibitor. Patient's clinical condition continued to deteriorate and family placed patient on comfort care. Conclusion: TTP patients have low A-IPC and PLT counts at presentation, with the former improving first post-TPE initiation. Despite appropriate therapy leading to early improvement of platelet count, patient's counts declined rapidly leading to suspicion for platelet production suppression as indicated by the sustained very low A-IPC. In the setting of TTP, or relapsing TTP use of immunosuppression should be closely followed and A-IPC may aid in establishing early if therapy is affecting platelet production.",

Blood Center of Zhejiang Province, Key Laboratory of Blood Safety Research, Ministry of Health Background/Case Studies: Detection of antibodies against human platelet antigens (HPAs) is crucial for patients' refractory to platelet transfusion therapy. In the text, Luminex bead coupled with anti-GPIIb/IIIa and anti-GPIa/IIa monoclonal antibody was implied to detect HPA-1a, HPA-3a, and HPA-5a antibodies, and the sensitivity of Luminex bead technology was compared with monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens (MAIPA) assay. Study Design/Method: Monoclonal antibodies P2 and Gi9, specific for platelet glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa and GPIa/IIa, were separately coupled to Luminex xMAP beads. Four standard sera, containing anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, anti-HPA-5a and anti-HPA-5b respectively, were bought from NIBSC; three negative sera without HPA antibodies were prepared from AB type blood donors. Platelets (containing HPA-1aa, HPA-3ab and HPA-5aa) were collected and reacted with anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, anti-HPA-5a and anti-HPA-5b standard sera respectively, then the antigen-antibody reaction complexes were lysed and the lysates were incubated with luminex beads to specifically capture antigen-antibody complexes via the epitopes on platelet glycoproteins. The beads-antigen-antibody complexes were then subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a Luminex100. The HPA-1a serum was diluted to 10 serial dilutions (from neat to 1/502) to test the sensitivities of MAIPA and Luminex beads assay. The two methods were then used to test five blinded samples which were collected from FMAIT patients. Results/Finding: Luminex bead technology showed that the MFI values of HPA-1a, HPA-3a, HPA-5a standard sera samples reacted with the coupled beads were significantly higher than the negative controls ( .08 vs 37.05), which implied that the Luminex bead technology could specifically identify negative and positive sera of anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, anti-HPA-5a. Furthermore, because the platelet was HPA-5aa, the HPA-5b serum did not react with the coupled beads with MFI was comparable to negative control (286.59 vs 127.25). The sera were re-tested by MAIPA and the results of which were comparable to Luminex bead technology, illustrating that detecting HPA antibodies by Luminex beads technology was successful. The sensitivity of Luminex bead assay and MAIPA to detect anti-HPA-1a was 1/128 (0.78IU/ml) and 1/64 (1.56IU/ml), respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed with the samples containing HLA, ABO or other platelet antibodies. All results of five blinded samples tested by Luminex assay showed that four sera were positive for GPIIb/IIIa antibodies which were consistent with MAIPA results. Conclusion: The Luminex beads coupled with GPIIb/IIIa and GPIa/IIa monoclonal antibodies could be successfully used to detect HPA-1a, HPA-3a and HPA-5a antibodies via the epitopes on platelet glycoproteins. The sensitivity of Luminex technology was higher than MAIPA technology. (aHUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure in the absence of infectious toxin. The literature suggests the presence of pathogenic mutations in complement proteins in 50% of cases of aHUS. There is a lack of well-defined recommendations regarding testing for genetic aHUS. Complement pathway mutation analysis is an expensive test so appropriate utilization is crucial to prevent undue health care costs. We reviewed the indications for genetic testing to understand physician ordering practice and determine the frequency of pathogenic mutations in the population. Study Design/Method: We performed a retrospective review of all cases referred for complement pathway mutation analysis to a national reference laboratory from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016. Clinical history was solicited by genetic counselors. Cases were classified by the authors as primary aHUS (TMA and renal failure without identifiable cause), secondary TMA (TMA and renal failure with identifiable cause previously associated with TMA) or non-TMA. The test panel identified variants in complement proteins (CFH, CFI, MCP, Factor B, C3, C4BP, THBD, DGKE, CFHR3, CFHR1, CFHR4 and CFHR5) that were classified as VUS (variances of uncertain significance), pathogenic or benign by the American College of Medical Genetics. Chi square analysis/Fishers' exact test was used to determine differences in proportion of patients with pathogenic mutations and primary aHUS versus secondary TMA. Independent sample t-test was used to compare differences in continuous variables between primary aHUS and secondary TMA. Results/Finding: Of 134 patients tested, pathogenic mutations were detected in 13% (18/134) and VUS in 35% (47/134). 20% (27/134) of patients did not fulfill criteria for TMA; no pathogenic mutations were found in this group and 9 (33%) had VUS. 31% (42/134) of patients had primary aHUS; of these, 28% (12/42) had pathogenic mutations and 40% (17/42) had VUS. 48% (65/134) of patients had secondary TMA; of these, 9% (6/65) had pathogenic mutations and 32% (21/65) had VUS. In patients with pathogenic mutations, 39% (7/18) were children, 22.5% (4/18) had a positive family history of aHUS and 28% (5/18) had recurrent disease. Patients with primary aHUS had a significantly lower age at presentation (22 6 18 vs. 33 6 20 yrs; p-value: 0.005) and a higher proportion of pathogenic mutations (28% vs. 9% p-value: 0.009) compared to patients with secondary TMA. Gender distribution, hemoglobin nadir and serum creatinine levels were similar between the two groups. Conclusion: We found a lower frequency of patients with pathogenic mutations compared to reported literature. Our data suggests that patients with secondary TMA should be carefully evaluated prior to ordering genetic testing and those without TMA should not undergo this test.",

A flow cytometric method for counting of PLT in PCs has been developed as validation tool (van der Meer et al, Transfusion 2012). Therefore, it is pertinent to evaluate PLT counting in BCs on hematology analyzers with this validation method in a flow cytometer. Study Design/Methods: Samples from ten apheresis PCs and 33 buffy coat-derived PCs were subjected to PLT counting on hematology analyzers PentraXL80 (Horiba ABX, Montpelier, France) and XN9000 Sysmex TOA (Kobe, Japan) (both impedance score), and additionally, diluted and stained with anti-CD41a FITC in TrueCount tubes (BD Biosciences)(internal bead standard) for measuring in a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis IN, USA). Results were analyzed by Paired Samples Test and shown in Bland-Altmann plots. Results/Findings: Mean PLT values x10 9 /L 6 SD were 819 6118, (<) 1106 6137, (<) and 1195 6176 for counting by Sysmex TOA, PentraXL80, and the Gallios flow cytometer, respectively. Sysmex count was the very lowest 129A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 ABSTRACT (31.4% less than for flow cytometry), but all PLT counts were significantly different (p<0.001), although least so (7.4%) between Pentra and flow cytometry. Conclusion: As validated by the flow cytometric method, PentraXL80 seems suitable for routine quality control of PCs both because of the small difference and lower counts compared with flow cytometric method, which is too cumbersome in a routine setting. The much lower PLT count on Sysmex may reflect its optimization for PLT counting in whole blood rather than in PCs.",

HPA typing has typically been performed using PCR-SSP, a method that utilizes time-consuming post PCR analysis steps. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of real-time PCR-based techniques in a transfusion laboratory setting. Study Design/Method: We evaluated a commercially available solution which consists of 24 reactions that identify both variants of 12 relevant SNPs located within HPA genes (HPA-1 through HPA-11, and HPA 15). Genomic DNA purified from 48 blood samples, previously genotyped for HPA-1,-2,-3,-4,-5 and -15 by our in house PCR-SSP method were used in this study as validation samples. Results/Finding: Results of the validation samples were 100% concordant with typing obtained by PCR-SSP. The Real-Time PCR approach overcomes the major challenges of HPA molecular typing by providing an automated solution resulting in increased laboratory productivity and decreased turn-around time. The analysis is facilitated by a software which generates the results. With less than 10 minutes of hands-on set-up and no further operator intervention with the reagents, complete molecular genotyping results are provided in approximately 90 minutes. Further, since amplified products are never handled, the risk of laboratory contamination is significantly reduced.",

            "text": "Genetic Variation of CD36 Antigen Deficiency Expression in Jiangsu Chinese Han Population Qing Chen* 1 , Jianyu Xiao 1 and Chengyin Huang 2 . 1 Jiangsu Province Blood Center, 2 Jiangsu province Blood Center Background/Case Studies: CD36 has been implicated in the platelet refractoriness, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and posttransfusion purpura, especially in the non-Caucasian. CD36 deficiency varies widely among different ethnic populations, with the frequency of 3-11% in Asians and 2.4% of African Americans, respectively. However, there is little information on the molecular basis of individuals with CD36 deficiency in Jiangsu Chinese Han population. Study Design/Method: To investigate platelet CD36 expression levels and to determine the molecular basis of CD36 deficiency on the platelet surface of the Han population in Jiangsu region. CD36 expression levels on platelets were detected by flow cytometry among 243 blood donors in Jiangsu region. Donors without CD36 antigen expression on their platelet surface were further to be determined the expression of CD36 antigen on their peripheral blood monocyte cells. The coding exons of CD36 gene and adjacent introns were amplified and sequenced in CD36 deficient individuals. Results/Finding: Among these 243 blood donors, CD36-deficient and CD36-expression individuals were 2.47% (6/243) and 97.53% (237/243), respectively. The frequencies of Type I and Type II CD36 deficiency among the study population were 0.41% (1/243) and 2.06 % (5/243), respectively. Among 237 individual with platelet CD36 expression, according to mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value, 45, 141 and 51 individuals showed low, moderate and high expression levels of CD36, respectively, and their MFIs were 1725.9 6 343.6, 3876.1 6 788.5 and 8431.6 6 529.9 (P<0.05), respectively. The type I CD36 deficiency individual were heterozygous for 1200-13A>G and 430-14C>G, respectively. Among Type II CD36 deficiency individuals, two harbored a T insertion at position 560 in exon 6 which caused frameshift at codon 187; one has a T>C exchange at position 538 in exon 6 which resulted in a tryptophan to arginine substitution at codon 180; one has a A insertion before the 17th bp of the start codon ATG in the promoter region; one were heterozygous for 748 1 2T>C and 1006 1 2T>G, respectively. Conclusion: Platelet CD36 surface expression levels were diversified in the Jiangsu Chinese Han population. The frequency of the Type II CD36 deficiency was higher than that in Type I. The study findings indicated that the frequency of CD36 deficiency in the Chinese population is slightly lower than that in other Asian countries. Background/Case Studies: CD36-deficient phenotype can be immunized by pregnancy or transfusion, and involved in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion refractoriness and other disorders. The frequency of platelet CD36-deficient individuals widely varies among ethnic groups, with 3% to 11% in Japanese, 8% in sub-Saharan Africans, 2.4% in African Americans, and 0.3% in Caucasians. Although some studies of CD36 deficiency are focused on the Asian populations, relatively little information has been reported in the Chinese population. Here we investigated the CD36 expression on platelets in large samples of the Eastern Chinese donors. Study Design/Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 1282 unrelated platelet-apheresis donors in the Eastern China. The expression of CD36 antigen on platelets was determined by flow cytometry using fluorescein conjugated monoclonal antibodies (FITC-anti-CD36 and PEanti-CD41). The isotype control (FITC-mouse IgG) was also analyzed to calculate a reference range of CD36-nagtive phenotype. For those donors with CD36-negative platelets, CD36 antigen expression on monocytes was analyzed further to distinguish between CD36 type I and type II deficiency. Flow cytometric parameters were statistically analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81570170) and Zhejiang High-Level Innovative Health Talents. Results/Findings: The MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) of platelet CD36 in all 1282 samples showed a continuous distribution profile, and no obvious fluorescence-gap could be utilized to distinguish negative from positive phenotype. On account of this limitation, we classified the CD36 phenotypes using the (mean 1 3SD) of the background MFI observed in isotype controls. Forty-three samples were detected as CD36 deficiency on platelet, in which one sample was CD36 negative both on platelet and monocyte. The frequency of CD36 type I and type II deficiency in the Eastern Chinese donors was 0.08% and 3.3%, respectively. The average MFI of CD36 deficiency samples was significantly lower than CD36 positive samples (15.2 6 7.9 vs 79.8 6 37.8, P< 0.0001). Conclusion: The frequency of platelet CD36 deficiency in the Eastern Chinese donors was close to Japanese and African Americans. It means that the possibility of CD36 antibody occurred by pregnancy and transfusion in this population is existed. It is useful to find and register CD36-deficient donors by large-samples screening for potential immune thrombocytopenia patients with CD36 antibody. ",

Although rare among whites, CD36 deficiency (CD36-n) is observed in 3-10% of Africans (T1264G) & is classified as either type I (CD36-n PLT, CD36-n MONO) or type II (CD36-n PLT, CD361 MONO). An acquired type II CD36-n phenotype can also be observed in the setting of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Type 1 CD36-n individuals can develop anti-CD36 alloantibodies with PLT refractoriness & neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. We report a case of profound PLT refractoriness caused by anti-CD36 in a patient with newly diagnosed MDS. Study Design/Method: HLA antibody testing was performed with a commercial bead-based fluorescent assay. CD36 phenotyping (PLT, MONO) of patient & family members was performed by flow cytometry (FC). CD36 staining of bone marrow was performed by immunohistochemistry. PLT crossmatching (PLT-XM) was performed by the American Red Cross. PLTspecific alloantibody testing & CD36 DNA sequencing were performed at a commercial reference laboratory. Results/Finding: The patient was an 80 year-old, group O1 African-American male who presented with blurry vision & lightheadedness. Complete blood count findings were significant for hemoglobin 4.4 g/dL & PLT count 5K/mL. Bone marrow biopsy & cytogenetic analysis revealed multilineage dysplasia, 5-10% blasts & a complex karyotype with del(7)(q22q34) consistent with MDS. PLT refractory work-up was initiated after repeated PLT transfusion failures with corrected count increments (CCIs) < 5. HLA antibody testing was negative (class I panel reactive antibody (PRA)50%). The patient was PLT-XM-incompatible with most donors (10/14). A trial of 4 group O, PLT-XM-compatible PLTs was unsuccessful (CCI 1). Subsequent testing for PLT-specific alloantibodies identified anti-CD36. FC-phenotyping showed no CD36 on patient's MONO or PLT, consistent with type I CD36-n. Preliminary DNA results show that the patient is heterozygous for T1264G. Because CD36-n apheresis PLT were unavailable from blood suppliers, the patient's 3 children & grandson were screened as possible donors: All showed normal CD36 expression on PLTs. Trial of eltrombopag & romiplostim was attempted with no improvement in PLT count. Repeat HLA antibody testing (day 16) demonstrated new class I alloantibodies (PRA 5 55%) in response to transfusion (21 apheresis PLTs, 5 RBCs). Given his PLT refractoriness & poor prognosis, the patient opted for hospice. Conclusion: We describe a patient with CD36-n & severe PLT refractoriness in the setting of new MDS, and 7q-chromosomal abnormalities. The absence of CD36 on PLT & MONO support congenital type 1 CD36-n although a contribution by the patient's underlying MDS cannot be excluded.",

In the emerging paradigm of personalized medicine, the selection of cellular products in accordance with patient immunomolecular signatures has the potential to reduce the rate of antibody-mediated platelet clearance and thus to improve treatment efficacy. While the benefits of customizing transfusion therapy have long been recognized (Gmur1978 http://bit.ly/2q51heq), the routine, real-time selection of platelets by immunogenetic profile has remained impractical by current methods of DNA analysis. To address this issue, we evaluated a process of platelet donor classification using buccal swab samples from apheresis platelet donors for determining the combined HLA class I and HPA signature without DNA purification using a novel \"LeanSequencing\" process.",

Briefly, after preparation of crude extracts, samples were amplified, pooled and analyzed (in separate runs) for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15 and for HLA Class 1 (A,B,C) , the latter using a proprietary design that limits analysis to informative alleles in the HLA sequence; this \"information-theoretic\" design permits direct allele and haplotype reconstruction using bmx-proprietary software. A subset of crude extracts was purified and analyzed side by side with positive and negative controls. Results/Finding: Crude extracts from buccal swabs produced viable profiles for HPA as well as HLA class I with significant savings in time-to-result. As an illustration, the table reports allele frequencies for platelet-antigens (\"HPA\") that are consistent with a predominantly Caucasian or Hispanic platelet donor population (http://bit.ly/2pDplF8) in HW equilibrium.

Blood Center of Shandong Province Background/Case Studies: There are 16,429 HLA alleles documented according to the IMGT / HLA Sequence Database in Janury2017, And more than 80% of them were identified in the last 10 years. Besides sequences many of the novel HLA alleles have not been analyzed their serological reactivities. HLA-A *26:82 allele was fist detected in our laboratory during our HLA typing for China Bone Marrow Donor Program(CMDP). For further study, the serological characteristics and heritage investigation were performed. Study Design/Methods: The routine HLA tying for the potential donors from CMDP were performed by bi-allelic Sequence-Based Typing method,using a commercial kit (ROSE Europe GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). In the case of no full matched HLA typing results, group specific HLAssure-SE SBT Typing Kit (Texas Biogene Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) was employed to identify the nucleotide sequences of the novel allele. Fresh blood samples were collected of the proband and his family members with the consent, in order to nanalysis the serological reactivities and the possible haplotype associations to the novel allele. The HLA serological specificity was indicated by One Lambda(ASN72D)HLA kit. Results/Findings: No full matched result was obtained at HLA-A locus in HLA typing for a donor,which suggested the possible existence of a novel allele. The latter nanalysis indicated that the proband have a nove1 nucleotide sequences at HLA-A locus, the new sequences was most close to those of HLA-A *26:01:01:01, but 1 nucleotide substitution in exon 4, by nt 746 C-A (codon225 ACC-AAC), which resulted in one aminoacid substitution ,Thr-Asn. The novel HLA-A allele was officially named as HLA-A Background/Case Studies: Anti-D is a frequent cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). As a rule, immunization occurs in D negative pregnant women, but occasionally anti-D is also observed in carriers of D variants. Currently, maternal plasma analysis for determination of the fetal RHD status became an exciting new tool for the management of D-negative pregnant women, but one of the challenges in non invasive fetal RHDgenotyping is the presence of D variants in the pregnant women. We present a case of a 13 year-old pregnant woman typed as AB1, who delivered a baby affected by severe HDFN. The newborn was typed as B1 and presented a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with an anti-D identified in the eluate. The baby was treated by exchange transfusion and the mother's sample was investigated.",

Background/Case Studies: Kell system antibodies inhibit erythropoiesis causing severe anemia in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). We report a case of HDFN secondary to anti-Kpb that resulted in multiple intrauterine transfusions of Kp (b-) donor cells and hemolytic anemia upon birth. Case: A 31 year old G5P3 presented during her fifth pregnancy with anti-Kpb with an initial titer measured of 64. By history, the anti-Kpb developed during her third pregnancy which ended in a spontaneous abortion before antibody titers could be initiated. The patient's antibody titers peaked at 16 during the fourth pregnancy which resulted in a healthy male without anemia or jaundice. . In the latest pregnancy, ultrasound was initiated with elevated middle cerebral artery Doppler exams (1.7 MoMs) peaking at 27 weeks. This resulted in three intrauterine transfusions. Due to potential labor and the finding of reversed diastolic flow on middle cerebral artery Doppler studies, a finding that has been associated with impending intrauterine fetal demise, Caesarean delivery was performed at 35 weeks gestation. The baby boy required phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia. The indirect bilirubin at birth was 3.4 mg/dL with 13.6 g/dL hemoglobin. The baby typed as O Positive, Kp (b1) with a micro positive DAT. The antibody workup revealed an anti-Kpb. Continued hemolysis required one more transfusion at 6 weeks of age. The positive DAT and passively acquired anti-Kpb were no longer detected by 8 weeks of age. His hemoglobin recovered to 9.0 g/dL with an indirect bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL at 9 weeks of age. All clinical signs of hemolytic anemia were resolved. Study Design/Method: Serologic testing included PEG IAT by tube methods. Acid elution was performed using Immucor Gamma ELU-KIT II. Molecular testing was performed using Immucor Bio-Array HEA platform. Results/Finding: Antibody identification on the mother was performed as well as alloadsorption studies to rule out other underlying alloantibodies. A new weakly reacting anti-S was detected on the day of the delivery. The baby typed as S positive however the anti-S was not detected in an eluate prepared from the baby's red cells. All of the intrauterine transfusion units were S negative. Conclusion: To our knowledge only five case reports have been described for anti-Kpb which resulted in moderate to severe HDFN. Pregnant mothers with anti-Kpb detected should be monitored closely. Background/Case Studies: In some clinical cases, the C3d-specific DAT may be too insensitive to detect low, but significant levels of C3d, or it may be inconclusive due to spontaneous red cell (RBC) aggregation. Further, the DAT is not well suited to quantify the number of immunoprotein molecules on RBCs, since a \"1111\" reaction corresponds to about 500 molecules/ cell. A number of flow cytometric methods for the detection of RBC-bound C3d have been published. However, these are mainly designed to quantify the fraction of RBCs with C3d-sensitization. The aim of this study is to present a flow cytometric method for the quantification of the level of RBCbound C3d. Study Design/Method: Ten microliters (uL) of 1:80 (after documenting experimentally that this amount ensured maximum binding of anti-C3d) mouse monoclonal anti-human anti-C3d (Abcam, clone 7c10) were added to 5 uL of a 2.5% RBC suspension. After incubation for 60 minutes at 4C, samples were washed x3, and 25 uL of 1:10 diluted anti-mouse-F(ab)2-PE (RO480, DAKO) were added. After incubation at 4C, samples were washed and resuspended before being acquired on a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACSCanto II). To enable calibration of fluorescence signals in antibody binding capacity (ABC), a calibration standard (DAKO QIFIKIT) stained with RO480 was run in parallel with all experiments. Background fluorescence (in ABC) was subtracted to yield net ABC values corresponding to specific staining with anti-C3d.",

To estimate the normal range of RBC-bound C3d, EDTA-stabilized samples from 4 healthy donors were tested. Finally, the assay was applied to a sample from a patient with clinical AIHA with an inconclusive DAT due to unspecific DAT polyreactivity. Results/Finding: The correlation of the net level of RBC-bound C3d (values ranging from 0 to 3,393 ABC) with level of 0-serum dilution (used to sensitize A1 RBCs) proved to be highly linear (logarithmic vs. logarithmic plot; r2 5 0.97, p < 0.0001). Compared with DC-Screening 1, the sensitivity of the flow cytometric assay was superior. It detected C3d sensitization at least 4 dilution steps further. The median normal level of RBC-bound C3d was 11 ABC (range 7-20 ABC, n54). The assay enabled demonstration of specific C3d-sensitization in the patient; the level of RBC-bound C3d in the sample was significantly elevated (1,907 ABC). Conclusion: The presented flow cytometric assay is capable of quantifying the level of RBC-bound with a high degree of linearity and analytical sensitivity. Further, it is capable of quantifying the level of RBC-bound C3d in DAT polyreactive samples. Background/Case Studies: ABO blood group system of red blood cells (RBCs) consists of A and B oligosaccharide antigens and anti-A and anti-B antibodies against these antigens, which are present in the sera of individuals who do not express the antigen(s)(Landsteiner's Law). Because of the expression of those antigens on some epithelial and endothelial cells in the body, the ABO matching is critical not only in blood transfusion, but also in cell/tissue/organ transplantation. In spite of the fact that both antigens and antibodies are involved, these genetic traits are specified by a single genetic locus of ABO. Forssman (FORS) system is another RBC blood group system which consists in a glycosylation polymorphism specified by the GBGT1 gene. In humans, the ABO and GBGT1 genetic loci are located on chromosome 9q34, and the functional alleles encode A and B glycosyltransferases (AT and BT) and Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS), which catalyze the last biosynthetic steps of A and B, and Forssman (FORS1) oligosaccharide antigens. The molecular genetic bases for allelism of those two systems in humans have been well-elucidated. The ABO and GBGT1 genes are also present in some other species in addition to humans. However, the presence/absence and functionality/non-functionality are species-dependent. Molecular mechanisms/forces that created this species divergence, including human polymorphism, were unknown. Study Design/Methods: Utilizing genomic information available from Gen-Bank and Ensembl databases, the gene maps of the chromosomal region surrounding the ABO and GBGT1 genes have been constructed of 88 vertebrate species. Results/Findings: Extensive similarities were observed in the kinds, numbers, and orders of genes, as well as their chromosomal locations. However, numerous differences were also identified. These include chromosomal rearrangements, as well as the insertions and amplifications of specific genes. Interestingly, the ABO and GBGT1 genes were found located at the boundaries of chromosomal fragments that seem to have undergone frequent inversions/translocations during species evolution. Conclusion: Genetic alterations, such as deletions and duplications, are known to be prevalent at the ends of rearranged chromosomal fragments. Therefore, the species-dependent divergence and polymorphism within species of those clinically important glycosyltransferase genes may have been resulted, at least partially, from unstable chromosomal structures neighboring those genes.",

University of Missouri Health Care Background/Case Studies: Red blood cell transfusion plays an important role in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell patients have a significantly increased risk of alloimmunization compared to the general population, and the standard of care is to provide phenotypically matched units for at least C, E, and K1 antigens to reduce this risk. Unfortunately, the genotype and true alloimmunization risk may not always be accurately represented by the red blood cell phenotype, particularly in patients with complex partial RHCE variants.

An antibody screen was positive, and antibodies against C and e antigens were identified in the plasma. The patient had only received phenotypically matched units negative for C and E antigens for all previous transfusions at our institution, based on her known red blood cell phenotype. Blood samples were sent to a reference laboratory for molecular testing to look for partial RHCE variants that might explain the antibody development. Results/Finding: Molecular testing was performed to reveal the presence of two different partial RHCE alleles, resulting in a predicted phenotype of D1, C-, E-, partial c1, partial e1. The probable RHCE genotype, RHCE*ce-JAL/RHCE*ce733G, results in partial expression of both c and e antigens. In addition to the known risk of alloimmunization against the absent C and E antigens, this result indicates that the patient is also capable of forming alloantibodies against the absent portions of both c and e antigens. Based on these results, the patient's anti-e was determined to be an alloantibody and not an autoantibody. Conclusion: Although phenotypically matched units are standard of care for patients with sickle cell disease, the red blood cell phenotype may not accurately represent the alloimmunization risk in patients with complex partial RHCE genotypes. In this case, molecular testing confirmed that the patient is at risk of developing alloantibodies against C, c, E, and e antigens. As the patient had already made alloantibodies against C and e antigens, it was determined that she would require units that were molecularly matched to her RHCE variants for all future transfusions. This case demonstrates that phenotype matching for sickle cell disease patients may not be adequate to prevent alloimmunization in individuals with partial RHCE variants.",

As previously reported (Vege et al, Transfusion 2007) the c.1154G>C change (p.G385A), which characterizes the RHD*weak D type 2 allele is a splicing variant that induces skipping of the whole RHD exon 9. We report an altered splicing in the RHD*weak D type 2 allele associated with the skipping of exon 9 in a pregnant women and her newborn with weak D expression. Study Design/Method: The D antigen expression was evaluated with 4 commercially available monoclonal anti-D reagents: 1 blended IgM/IgG (clones TH-28/MS-26), 2 IgM (clones MS201 and P3x61) and 1 IgG (MS26) in tube and on gel cards. C, c, E and e phenotyping were performed in gel. RHD genotyping was performed with the RHD BeadChip platform from Immucor. Direct automated sequencing of the 10 RHD exons and flanking intron regions was performed by the Sanger dideoxy method. Results/Finding: Both pregnant women and newborn samples were phenotyped as D1 w C-c1E1e1. The samples showed weak hemagglutination reactions (11/21) with all anti-D clones used. RHD Beadchip results showed the LS* signal indicating a possible deletion of exon 9 in both DNA samples. Sequencing showed the c.1154G>C change and the intronic c.1154-8T>A and c.1154-31T>C substitutions, which are associated to the RHD*weak D type 2 allele. Conclusion: Our results showed that c.1154G>C associated with c.1154-8T>A and c.1154-31T>C variations had probably a functional impact on splicing inducing exclusion of exon 9 in both DNA from mother and newborn. This finding is important to develop assays and interpret genotyping results, as current guidelines do not recommend anti-D IgG prophylaxis for women with weak D type 2. Background/Case Studies: Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to minimize disease-specific symptomatology. Previous studies have shown that more than 50% of children with SCD receive at least one RBC transfusion in their lifetime. Both simple transfusions and erythrocytapheresis are associated with increased risk of RBC alloimmunization. Published literature is lacking on the frequency of alloimmunization and geographical associations in pediatric populations, which is made difficult to compare due to lack of standardized categorization of what represents a pediatric patient population across studies. Therefore, we looked at the alloimmunization rates of pediatric patients with SCD in the Unites States (US) and other countries. Study Design/Method: A literature search was performed for studies published on alloimmunization rates of SCD pediatric patients including HbSS, sickle beta-thalassemia and HbSC. We evaluated the overall alloimmunization rates as number of alloantibodies per transfused patient and alloantibodies per 100 transfused units across world literature and compared them using chi-square analysis. Results/Finding: Fourteen studies reporting data to derive alloimmunization rates of pediatric SCD patients were found. These included eleven US studies with 1,057 patients and 3 studies from other regions (Brazil, Egypt and France) with 641 patients. Majority of patients included in the studies had HbSS disease. Patients received either episodic, chronic simple transfusions or erythrocytapheresis. Age range for the US studies was 0 to 26 years and for the other countries 0 to 20 years. Available data from 5 US studies included a total of 91 alloantibodies, the most frequent of which were antibodies to C, E, Kell, M, S and Kidd antigens (18.7%, 16.5%, 15.4%, 7.7%, 7.7% and 6.5% respectively). Alloimmunization rates were calculated as antibodies per patient in some studies and antibodies per 100 transfused units in other studies. We evaluated rates using both approaches as per available data. US had an alloimmunization rate of 16.5 % (14.1 to 19.2, 95% CI) vs. 9.4% for non-US studies (7.3-11.8, 95% CI) (p50.0008) and 134A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 more alloantibodies per transfused patient (0.25 vs. 0.096, p50.0001). Similarly, the number of alloantibodies per 100 transfused units in the US, evaluated from five studies, was higher compared to a large French patient cohort (0\u00c168 vs. 0.33, p50\u00c10005). Average number of RBC units transfused per patient in the US was also higher compared to data from France (77 vs. 45, p50.0001). Conclusion: Despite limited studies available to compare alloimmunization rates in pediatric SCD patients in the US and other countries, the overall rates are higher in the US. Though no definitive reasons could be concluded from the available data, limiting the number of RBC exposures, i.e. units transfused in non-critical conditions could lead to lower alloimmunization rates. Results/Findings: A post-transfusion sample was referred to the IRL for a TRXN investigation. There were no clerical errors; however, hemolysis was present in the post-transfusion plasma/serum. ABO/Rh and crossmatches using LO-ION TM were repeated on the pre-and post-transfusion samples with no discrepancies. The post-transfusion DAT was positive with a negative eluate. The hospital requested another unit before the investigation was complete. Antibody identification on the post transfusion sample with LO-ION TM was negative. Suspecting a weak antibody, additional investigation using PeG TM on both samples revealed an anti-C. No additional clinically significant alloantibodies detected in the pre-or post-transfusion samples using PeG TM . Conclusion: The patient experienced an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction due to anamnestic interaction of anti-C in the patient's plasma/serum against C antigen on the transfused cells. Anti-C was not detected by our routine antibody identification techniques. The MMA confirmed anti-E, -M and -C were clinically significant.",

The antigens of the MNS system are carried on glycophorin A (GPA) and glycophorin B (GPB). Anti-En a is a rare immune IgM/IgG antibody made by individuals who lack all or part of the GPA protein. Anti-En a has been implicated in fatal HTR and HDFN. The En(a-)phenotype can result from either a rare deletion of the GPA protein or the even rarer M k phenotype. Because individuals with the M k phenotype lack both the GPA and GPB protein their red blood cells type as M-, N-, S-, s-, U-, En(a-), Wr(b-) and have reduced sialic acid. Study Design/Method: 23 year old white Mennonite female G1,P0 presented to her midwife for prenatal care with the intent of home delivery. She had a positive antibody screen by solid phase at the hospital transfusion service. An antibody identification panel was done in gel. Testing for antibodies against selected cells (U-and U var ) in tube with PEG enhancement and phenotyping was done. Based on MNS phenotype, anti-En a was suspected.

Three titers were performed for the remainder of the pregnancy and held at 2. Although anti-En a has been implicated in HDFN, a healthy infant was delivered without complications. This patient should be monitored closely through future pregnancies. Autologous donation and/or sibling testing should be considered in order to provide compatible blood for intrauterine transfusion or transfusions at or after delivery. Background/Case Studies: A 15 year old Caucasian male diagnosed with hemolytic anemia and no previous transfusions was referred to the Immunohematology Reference Laboratory (IRL) for antibody identification and RBC genotyping. Initial serologic testing by the referring facility and the IRL demonstrated anti-D, anti-C and/or anti-G specificity with a positive auto control and IgG DAT. Anti-G has an anti-D, -C specificity and is most frequently found in rr individuals exposed to r'r cells. The G antigen is present on RBCs expressing either RhD and/or C and very rarely on D-C-G1 (r G r) cells. Both RHCE*C and RHD genes encode Ser103 which determines G expression. Rare RhD variant antigens lacking Ser103 are G-. Study Design/Methods: Serologic evaluation included tube testing using Gamma LO-ION TM (Immucor, Inc., Norcross, GA) enhancement, elution studies (Gamma ELU-KITV R II (Immucor, Inc.)), EDTA glycine acid treatment (Gamma EGA TM Kit (Immucor, Inc.)), allogeneic adsorptions with papain treated intact RBCs, reagent and patient-derived RBCs and antisera. Molecular testing was performed with BioArray Precise Type IVD HEA Assay (Immucor, Inc.). Results/Findings: Molecular testing revealed an RHCE*cE genotype (with a C-E1c1e-predicted phenotype) and an otherwise unremarkable RBC typing report. Serologically, the antibody(ies) demonstrated an anti-D, -C, -G specificity in the serum and eluate using R o r, R 2 R 2 , r'r, r G r and rr cells. This patient is predicted to be R 2 R 2 (DcE/DcE) therefore, anti-C is possible but an allogeneic anti-D or -G is exceptionally unlikely. Allogenic adsorptions using papain treated R o r and r'r cells excluded anti-C and anti-D, leaving anti-G as the only explanation of the initial findings. Reactivity with the patient's EGA treated (DAT negative) cells against the \"neat\" serum, eluate and anti-G antisera confirmed auto anti-G. Conclusion: Warm autoantibodies are common findings and often have an Rh specificity; however, these antibodies usually demonstrate a broad but weaker specificity in the eluate or in the serum when enhancements are used. This anti-G had no reactivity with G-cells. The differentiation of anti-G from anti-D and anti-C is generally academic as transfusion recommendations are the same: provide RhD-, C-units. It is relevant and clinically important to determine the presence or absence of anti-D in RhD negative women of childbearing age who present with an anti-G specificity. If anti-D is 135A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 excluded these women should receive RhIG as part of their prenatal care. In this case differentiating anti-D, -C from an auto anti-G was necessary to provide transfusion recommendations. Providing RhD-and C-units to give serologically compatible RBCs could result in formation of an allogeneic anti-e.",

Norcross, GA) while retaining the last wash to be tested in parallel. Two samples were >21 DAT positive, 2 were weakly DAT positive and 16 were DAT negative. The prepared eluates were observed for color (bluegreen/BG, blue-brown/BB, blue-purple/BP), and the pH was documented for the prepared eluate (Whatman 6.0-8.1pH. Whatman International. Maidstone, England). The prepared eluates and last washes were tested on the VISION and ECHO against an antibody screen. If the antibody screen was positive, the sample was tested against an antibody panel to determine specificity/pan-reactivity. Prior to the eluates being tested on the automated platforms, they were spun for 5 minutes twice to remove any RBC debris which could cause false positive reactions. Results/Findings: The eluates prepared ranged in color: 5 BB, 14 BG and 1 BP. The pH of all eluates ranged from 6.9-8.1 with the highest percentage of eluates at a pH of 8.1 (35%). Sixteen of the 20 eluates tested yielded the same results in both automation platforms (concordance of 80%). Four eluates with different results are summarized in Table 1 . Conclusion: The study demonstrated that both analyzers may be used for eluate investigations. Both methods yielded apparent false positive results on samples which were initially DAT negative. The ECHO was more sensitive, yielding false positive results (3) when the VISION was negative, while the VISION was false positive with one eluate with ECHO negative. There was no apparent association in the non-correlating eluate results in relation to color of eluate, age of sample when eluate was prepared, or pH of the eluate. A larger study may be able to better elucidate the apparent false positive results noted in this study between ECHO and VISION eluate study. Background/Case Studies: Blood agglutination observed by Landsteiner in 1900 led to the discovery of human blood groups. In the ABO system >200 alleles have been described. The glycosyltransferase encoded by most results in weakened expression of A or B or the null (Group O) phenotype. As testing methods and reagents improve, donors may appear to change their ABO type. Here we describe a frequent Group O blood donor (38 units over 17 years) who is actually A w . Study Design/Methods: Donations were tested with the PK7300 instrument (Beckman Coulter Inc.). Routine forward and reverse ABO testing was used to investigate the discrepancy. Molecular studies were performed by DNA sequencing of ABO introns 1,2 and 4 and exons 6 and 7. Specific primers located in the flanking intron regions of the blood group gene were used to amplify relevant exons by PCR. The template used is genomic DNA extracted from whole blood collected in EDTA. PCR-amplified exons are subjected to bidirectional DNA sequence analysis using standard Sanger dideoxy chemistry. Seqscape software (ABI) was used to analyze sequence data by comparing the obtained sequence to a reference sequence from NCBI. Results/Findings: Serologic results are shown in Table 1 . Tests with Anti-A, -A1, -B anti-A,B were negative as were the A2 cells in reverse testing. The results of DNA sequencing of ABO introns/exons are shown in Table 2 . The significant changes were found in exons 6 and 7. In exon 6 there was a nucleotide (NT) deletion of 261G which resulted in a shortened transcript due to a stop codon, and another NT substitution lead to the amino acid change Gly117Ala. Mutations in exon 7 included a NT substitution causing a Pro156-Leu change and a NT deletion 1061C resulting in shortened transcript.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Serologic testing of the donor plasma with A2 cells was nonreactive revealing the ABO discrepancy. Molecular testing confirmed the donor genotype is heterozygote A/O [ABO*O.01.01/ABO*AW.02] which predicts A w phenotype. Normally, donor RBCs are tested with Anti-A and -B and the reverse type confirmed by testing the with A1 and B cells. This ABO discrepancy was caused by the presence of anti-A1 in the plasma causing the forward and reverse type to be interpreted as group O. According to FDA guidelines, the donor is technically group A, and as such all donations need to be labeled as group A. The donor was contacted and instructed to cease donating blood for transfusion. If donations continue, the unit labeled group A would likely test as Group O at the transfusion facility resulting in an FDA reportable error. There are numerous reports in the literature of the relative insusceptibility of A2 cells to destruction by anti-A, however, there is one hemolytic transfusion reaction to A x blood transfused to a patient with a potent anti-A titer >1:1000. (Schmidt, Nacarrow et al. 1959) . A review of transfusion recipients of the donor reported here did not reveal any untoward reaction after transfusion. 136A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 extraction of gDNA from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood from pilot tubes derived from the unit. DNA extraction from whole blood is performed on up to 96 blood tubes using the BioRobot Universal System (QIAGEN). There is no information on the maximum acceptable age of the blood for this purpose, either from the vendor or in peer-reviewed literature. We set out to assess if blood up to 15 days post collection yielded suitable gDNA for downstream RBC genotyping. Study Design/Method: 92 EDTA blood tubes collected from random blood donors were used to extract DNA from 200 microliters of whole blood on day 5, 12 and 15 days post collection. Blood samples were stored at 2-8C before and after extraction. Tubes were brought to room temperature and rocked before loading on the BioRobot. Extraction was performed using the MDx Blood Minikit (QIAGEN). Resulting DNA samples were assessed for gDNA yield and absorbance A260/A280 using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). The extracted gDNA was tested using PreciseType HEA Molecular BeadChip (\"HEA\", Immucor) and failure rates on both the BioRobot and the HEA were assessed. Results/Finding: All three extractions were successful with no invalids (result50) on the BioRobot Universal Report. No evidence of visible clots or splatter during extraction was noted by the technologist. Out of the 92 samples, 20 samples were chosen at random and concentrations were measured using Nanodrop for each of the extracted plates. DNA concentrations ranged from 10.8 to 62.6 ng/uL. All readings with the exception of 1 (10.8ng/ uL) had concentrations >5 15ng/uL. Interestingly, the one that was <15ng/ uL on day 5, yielded >515ng/uL on day 12 and 15 post collection. Over the next 3 months, 67 sets of 92 samples were extracted and tested by HEA. Eighty-three (1.3%) failed extraction and 82 (1.3%) failed HEA. None of the samples that failed extraction were 12 or 15 days post collection; none of those that failed HEA were 15 days post collection; 3.7% were >10 <15 days post collection. Conclusion: Based on these results it can be concluded that EDTA blood tubes up to 15 days post collection can be used as a source of gDNA for RBC genotyping without negatively effecting the concentration of the resulting DNA samples and the validity of the resulting genotyping.",

A wide variation of reactivity was observed, including patients who were found to have consistently negative antibody screens. While there are several potential causes, neutralization of anti-CD38 antibodies could easily be tested by applying established techniques used for neutralizing antibody reactivity. Study Design/Method: Samples received were drawn as a standard of care. Indirect antiglobulin testing was performed using solid phase red cell adherence and gel. Neutralization was performed by adding equal volumes of negative daratumumab treated patients' plasma with positive daratumumab treated patients' plasma. A dilution control was made by adding saline to each positive patient's plasma. Samples were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and antibody screens were repeated. Serial two-fold dilutions were also tested to determine if the neutralization could be titered. Testing was repeated using various positive patient samples to determine if negative/positive combinations resulted in different reactivity. Results/Finding: All control samples remained positive. Positive/negative samples were negative in solid phase testing across all patient combinations at 1:1 dilutions. Variable reactivity was observed in gel. Serial dilutions showed that neutralization for 2 negative patients was observed up to a 1:4 dilution. Conclusion: Results suggest that patients' plasma may have a substance that neutralizes the antibodies. There is a possible correlation with patients who have persistent negative antibody screens and patient response to daratumumab. Additional studies are necessary to uncover how this correlates to patient outcomes. Further studies using a standardized daratumumabspiked sample will be conducted.

Providing this patient with rare En(a) negative red cells via national or international blood donor registries would have been an arduous task if needed. This patient had many compatible family members available and willing to donate blood. The M(k) null allele (s) within this family is likely due to a genetic recombination among the GYPA and GYPE genes rather than a mutation in both the GYPA and GYPB genes [3] . This results in the absence of glycophorins A and B and the constitutive antigens of the MNS blood group system. Our patient was exposed to the En(a) present on glycophorin A on her unborn baby's red cells (inherited from father) in utero with subsequent alloimmunization. In conclusion, this case report demonstrates a clinical approach in identifying a rare anti-En(a) antibody in a prenatal sample. The clinical finding of a rare antibody in which there is limited data requires leveraging every resource available in order to predict its behavior and provide safe blood products to patients who may require it. Background/Case Studies: Transfusions are essential for patients with SCD and thalassemia to maintain growth and development during childhood and to sustain good quality of life during adulthood; however, the development of red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies and autoantibodies complicates transfusion therapy in such patients. Routine phenotyping of blood recipients and the use of phenotype-matched blood units for transfusion has been useful to lower the occurrence of red cell alloantibodies in chronically transfused patients with thalassemia and SCD. Nevertheless, extensive phenotyping is expensive, laborious and cannot be performed in certain situations. The molecular understanding of blood groups has enabled the design of assays 137A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 that are being used to better guide matched red blood cell transfusions and to maintain an inventory of units DNA typed. Based on this, our aim was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of molecular matching performed at different levels during 3 years for patients with SCD and thalassemia. Study Design/Method: Blood group genotypes were determined in 67 DNA samples from chronically transfused patients with SCD, in 65 patients with thalassemia and in 3000 DNA samples from blood donors. Laboratory developed tests (LDTs), HEA BeadChip TM , RHD BeadChip TM , RHCE Bead-Chip TM , and sequencing were used to determine the genotypes among patients and donors. Molecular matching was performed in 3 levels: (1) RH and K matching; (2) extended matching and (3) extended matching including RH variants. We considered the total of red blood cell units requested for each patient and a number of 2 donations per year for the compatible donors. Results/Finding: According to the patients needs we performed molecular matching for 100% of our thalassemic and SCD patients at level 1, 90% for SCD patients and 70% for patients with thalassemia at level 2 and 30% for patients with SCD and 90% for patients with thalassemia at level 3. The patients were transfused with a median of 36.4 RBC units. After three years of molecular matching, we observed that this transfusion strategy avoided new alloantibodies development and hemolytic transfusion reactions in all studied patients. Conclusion: Molecular matching has shown clinical benefits to the patients with SCD and thalassemia, contributing significantly to reduce the rates of alloimmunization to 5-10% with C E K matching and <1% with extended matching. Improvements in the clinical outcomes of the patients have also been observed as shown by an increase in their Hb levels and reduction in the % of HbS in SCD patients, better in vivo RBC survival and diminished frequency of transfusions.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The ideal manual backup method for an automated antibody detection system is an important choice. Currently, our backup method is saline tube (6 drops plasma, 30 minutes incubation). The change to either a low ionic strength solution (LISS) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) method would reduce incubation time to 10 minutes and specimen volume to 2 drops, both important laboratory considerations. Objectives of this study were to compare the relative sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of PEG and LISS, and to determine the most appropriate manual backup method for the existing automated solid phase system. Study Design/Method: A total of 202 specimens were compared utilizing: automated solid phase red cell adherence assay (SPRCA) with manual tube PEG and LISS, some samples were not sufficient quantity to test in LISS. Identification panels were used to determine: clinically significant antibodies, warm autoantibodies, and nonspecific reactions. Calculations were based upon comparison to SPRCA. Results/Findings: A total of 164 clinically significant antibodies were detected using SPRCA technique, as well as 9 warm autoantibodies and 97 nonspecific reactions. PEG demonstrated the highest sensitivity and lowest specificity while LISS was least sensitive and most specific for clinically significant antibodies. For warm autoantibodies, LISS was more sensitive than PEG with both being 100% specific. Both reduced the detection of nonspecific reactions. While PEG had more nonspecific reactions (30 versus 13), it identified more clinically significant antibodies (129) than LISS (93). (Table) Conclusion: Ultimately, the decision to choose a manual backup method must be based upon the highest sensitivity for clinical significant antibodies so as to minimize failure to detect one. PEG was selected as the backup manual method even though PEG has a higher sensitivity to nonspecific reactions.

Leger 1 . 1 American Red Cross Blood Services, 2 Long Beach Memorial Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Monoclonal anti-CD38, e.g., daratumumab (DARA), which is used to treat patients with multiple myeloma, causes positive indirect antiglobulin tests (IATs) due to expression of CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs). This serologic reactivity cannot be removed by adsorption so other methods have been developed to detect/identify underlying alloantibodies. One popular method is to denature the CD38 antigen by treatment of RBCs with thiol reagents, e.g., dithiothreitol (DTT) or 2aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET). Chapuy et al described (2015) and validated (2016) 2), and 6% AET (pH 8.0) as per the AABB Technical Manual, 17th ed. These treated and untreated RBCs were stored in Alsevers at 4C and tested on days 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 by two methods: 1) polyethylene glycol (PEG) IAT using plasma from two myeloma patients who had received DARA (plasmas from 8 total DARA patients were tested with reactivity 5 1-31), and 2) flow cytometry using phycoerythrin (PE)labeled anti-CD38. RBCs were also tested on days 1 and 5 or 8 with a serum containing anti-k by PEG IAT. Results/Findings: The 0.2M DTT in pH 8.0 PBS had a final pH of 7.3 and the pH of the commercial 0.2M DTT was 6.5. Results are in Table  1 ; flow cytometry results from days 2, 4 and 5 (data not shown) were similar to those from days 1 and 8. RBCs treated with 0.2M DTT (both sources) or AET were nonreactive with anti-k and plasma from all DARA patients and gave very low results (% positive events) with PE anti-CD38 by flow cytometry for up to 8 days after treatment. RBCs treated with 0.01M DTT reacted similarly to untreated RBCs with anti-k and DARA plasmas, and showed only some weakening (10-30%) of reactivity with PE anti-CD38. Background/Case Studies: Clinically significant hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn (HDN) is often caused by feto-maternal RhD incompatibility. With the discovery 1997 of cell-free fetal DNA (ccfDNA) in maternal plasma, it became possible to determine the RHD genotype of the fetus using non-invasive techniques. However, the reliability of the non-invasive prenatal RHD test (NIP RHD) is dependent on sufficient amounts of cffDNA in the maternal plasma sample. Recent studies show that the fraction of ccfDNA in maternal plasma varies significantly between pregnant women and is inversely related to maternal body mass index (BMI). Thus, high maternal BMI, may impair the validity of NIP RHD. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of maternal BMI on the correctness of NIP RHD and the correlation of maternal BMI with fraction of ccfDNA to total free DNA in the sample. Study Design/Method: Measurements of body height and weight of pregnant RhD negative women in gestational week 12 were obtained from patient records and used for the calculation of maternal BMI. Data on BMI were combined with the results from NIP RHD (real-time PCR targeting RHD exon 5 and 10) and sample fraction of ccfDNA (measured as threshold cycle [Ct] value of RHD) to total free DNA (measured as Ct of CCR5) in gestational week 25. The correctness of NIP RHD was determined by correlation with postnatal serological RhD determination. Results/Finding: A total of 1618 pregnant women were included. NIP RHD was positive in 987/1618 (61%), negative in 582/1618 (36%) and inconclusive in 49/1618 (3.0%). Compared to the postnatal RhD type, 9/987 (0.1%) of NIP RHD results were false positive (FP) and 4/582 (0.7%) were false negative. In 5/49 (10%) of inconclusive NIP RHD, the postnatal RhD type was positive. Mean BMI (n51618) at gestational week 12 was 25.3 (10-and 90-percentiles: 20.0 -32.4). There was no difference in mean BMI between individuals who tested inconclusive or false negative by NIP RHD compared to the remainder (p50,71). The fraction of ccfDNA was calculated for 150 randomly selected NIP RHD true positive cases. Median ccfDNA ratio was 5.47 (the distribution had a highly positive skew, 10-and 90-percentiles: 0.64 -27.2). There was no statistical correlation between BMI and fraction of ccfDNA to total free DNA (r2 50,012; p50.49). Conclusion: Neither the correctness of NIP RHD test result nor the fraction of cffDNA to total free DNA appear to be correlated to maternal BMI with regard to maternal plasma samples drawn in the 25th gestational week.",

Cleveland Clinic Background/Case Studies: Lan is a high-prevalence antigen and the sole member of the LAN blood group system. Anti-Lan is a very rare IgG antibody, with conflicting information regarding its clinical significance and potential for hemolysis. We report a case of delayed hemolysis in a patient with anti-Lan antibody. Study Design/Method: The patient's medical record and available literature were reviewed. Results/Finding: An 83 year old man, O-positive, with a history of heart disease and bladder cancer was admitted for radical cystectomy. The antibody screen and panel were panreactive by multiple test methods (gel, LISS, PEG) with negative autocontrols and DAT and a saline antibody titer of 1, suggestive of an antibody to a high-frequency antigen. Anti-Lan antibody was identified by a reference laboratory. Only 1 in 20,000 donors are Lan-, but two frozen RBC units were locally available and transfused postoperatively. The patient's siblings were tested; one O-positive, Lan-sibling was identified.",

At this time, the antibody screen was weakly reactive with 1 cell and new antibodies were ruled out. Blood conservation measures were instituted, including limited blood draws and cell salvage for surgery. Due to bleeding during and after surgery, 4 Lan-RBC units were transfused over 4 days, including rare donor units and units from the sibling donor. Another surgical procedure was then performed; by post-operative day 2, the patient had symptomatic anemia with hemoglobin (Hb) 5.3 g/dL and serially increasing troponin. No Lan-RBC units were available. Four RBC units untested for Lan were transfused without adverse event; the units were presumed Lan1 but crossmatch compatible and phenotypically matched for the patient's other antigens. A post-transfusion Hb of 10.2 g/dL was maintained for 4 days. The antibody screen was negative on day 3 post-transfusion, but strongly panreactive on day 6, with a positive DAT (IgG 21, C3 11) and anti-Lan antibody identified in the plasma and eluate. There was also evidence of extra-vascular hemolysis, including a progressive decrease in Hb from 10.9 g/dL on day 5 to 7.4 g/dL by day 8 with no bleeding identified, and increase in total bilirubin and LDH (peak 2.4 mg/dL and 304 U/L on day 7) with normal haptoglobin. The patient was febrile with leukocytosis, but had negative cultures and no other evidence of infection. A Lan-RBC unit was transfused on day 8 with good response (Hb 8.1 g/dL). The patient remained stable and was discharged to a skilled nursing facility 6 days later. Conclusion: Transfusion of Lan1 RBCs caused a resurgence of anti-Lan antibody and a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction 6 days after transfusion. The rarity of Lan-units may require a patient with anti-Lan to be transfused with Lan1 units, but close monitoring for delayed hemolysis is necessary even if the antibody is not demonstrable at the time of transfusion.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Study Design/Method: Antibody screen and compatibility testing was performed by automated solid phase (Echo and Neo, lmmucor, Inc). Red cell phenotyping was done by standard tube testing with commercial reagents following the manufacturers instructions. Molecular genotyping was performed using the Bloodchip assay (Grifols, San Marcos TX). Elution studies were performed using the ELU-Kit II (lmmucor, Inc.) Results/Finding: The initial antibody screen (AS) was negative and the patient was transfused 1 unit O-RBCs. Two weeks later the patient received an additional O-RBC. Within 4 days the Hgb had decreased from 8.3 to 7.1 g/dl, the AS and Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) were now positive, and Ounits were incompatible. Anti-f was identified in the patient's plasma and eluate. Three additional units were requested for transfusion. Due to the rarity of O-f-RBCs, the patient was transfused 3 R 1 R 1 (DCe/DCe) RBCs with no reported complications. The patient was discharged to follow up in clinic. Molecular genotyping showed the patient was RhD deleted (RHO* del) and had normal RHCE (RHCE*ce/RHCE*ce) genes which predict a D-C-E-c1e1f1 phenotype. The Rh phenotype and AS was repeated on a sample collected 18 days later. The C typing was micro positive, mixed field only after 5 minute incubation. The other Rh antigens were not mixed filed, and the AS was non reactive. However, the DAT was weakly positive with anti-lgG. No elution study was performed. Conclusion: The expected post 24 hour Hgb increment from the receipt of a standard unit of blood should be near 1 g/dl (or 3% Hct.) Throughout this patients hospitalization, the post-transfusion increments did not fully achieve this expectation. The first transfuion resulted in a 0.9 g/dl increase, and the second unit was only 0.5 g/dl. The last transfusion of 3 units increased by only 1.2 g/dl. Less than three weeks later, the RhC antigen typing was microscopic/mixed field only after extended incubation, indicating the removal of 3 R 1 R 1 units was nearly complete. In a case from 1989, Ohto and Kariyone (Transf. 1989; Vol29, No. 3) reported a 51 Cr \u00c1survival study of f1 RBCs in a patient with anti-f. They showed that the initital survival of f1 cells was fairly normal, however, after 18 days, there was a sudden increase of red cell destruction, and by day 27 all f1 cells were cleared from the circulation. It is not unusual to find auto-anti-f as many have been reported, however, it is unusual to find the auto-antibody has caused the clearance of three units of f-negative blood. This patient will be monitored to see if the autoantibody recurs and determine if it still has anti-f specificity. Background/Case Studies: Use of dithiothreitol (DTT) treated reagent red cells (RRBC) is increasing in blood banks as an effective way to negate the interfering panreactivity caused by Daratumumab, an anti-CD38 drug for treatment of multiple myeloma. Daily preparation of DTT-treated RRBC for testing of individual patients is burdensome for the laboratory and may delay patient care. We evaluated the effectiveness of batch-prepared DTT-treated RRBC, stored up to 9 days after treatment, in antibody detection tests.",

RRBC were treated with 0.2M DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) and stored in reagent red cell diluent. RRBC were tested with commercial antisera (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan NJ and Immucor, Norcross GA) per the manufacturer's instructions for specificities from the Rh, Duffy, Kidd and MNS blood groups (see Table  1 ). Patient source antibodies (anti-D, anti-c) were also tested. Testing was performed before DTT treatment, on the day of DTT treatment and up to 9 days following the DTT treatment of RRBC. Reactions were graded using standard serological grading of 0 (negative) to 41 (positive) reaction strength. Stored DTT-treated RRBC were also observed for hemolysis during the storage period. Results/Findings: See Table 1 for a summary of results. Commercial monoclonal and human source antisera, and patient source antibody, were reactive with the DTT-treated RRBC throughout the storage period. Reactivity decreased by less than one reaction grade for all antisera and patient source antibodies tested. Mild to moderate hemolysis was noted in the DTTtreated RRBC's during the storage period. Conclusion: DTT-treated RRBC showed adequate reactivity with various red cell antisera after storage for up to 9 days. This suggests that DTTtreated reagent red cells can be stored for at least 9 days and used for the detection of alloantibodies with minimal effect on detection ability. Batch preparation and storage of DTT-treated RRBC can increase testing efficiency and decrease turn-around-time when performing pre-transfusion testing for patients receiving anti-CD38 therapy.",

            "text": "Interference: More Than Just Kell? Marilyn Stewart*, Angela Treml and Geoffrey Wool. University of Chicago Background/Case Studies: Daratumumab (DARA) is an anti-myeloma and anti-lymphoma agent that is known to interfere with routine Blood Bank antibody screening tests. DARA is an IgG monoclonal antibody that binds CD38 that is present on the red cell surface. At the University Of Chicago Blood Bank, we have seen many patients treated with DARA and were showing this interfering reactivity. It has been well described that CD38 is a disulfidelinked molecule and its immune epitopes are disrupted by reducing agents such as DTT. We performed a validation of DTT-treatment of reagent RBC to abrogate DARA interference. Study Design/Methods: The validation was done to prove that DTT treated red cells could be used to screen patients receiving DARA and still detect clinically significant allo-antibodies. Screening cells and panel cells selected for DTT treatment were those RBC homozygous for clinically significant antigens, therefore allowing rule-outs of clinically significant antibodies in patient plasma. Several patients that had received the DARA drug protocol were selected for testing as well as many patients that had allo-and auto-antibodies (but not DARA treatment). Reagent screening cells and panel cells were treated with 0.2M DTT prepared using the SOP from Judd's Methods in Immunohematology and the AABB Technical Manual. The treated cells were preserved between testing episodes using Alsever's solution, stored at ABSTRACT 2-5C, and observed for hemolysis (none was seen) for up to 21 days. All immunohematology testing using DTT-treated cells was performed using gel methodology. Untreated and DTT treated cells were tested with anti k before any patient testing was done. The untreated cells reacted 2-41 with the anti k, and the treated cells were negative. These controls were run and tested each time DTT treatment was done. Thirty eight patient samples, including six DARA patient samples were tested. Results/Finding: Of the six patients who had DARA interference in their untreated antibody screens, all samples had negative reactions with the DTT treated cells except one patient, which had weak reactions in one cell. This specimen was repeated three times and all repeats had weak positive reactions in the same cell. This sample was sent to the ARC reference lab for DTT treatment and all clinically significant antibodies were ruled out. Patients with allo-antibodies present in their plasma did react with the DTT treated cells as would be expected based on the underlying alloantibody, with the exception of newly formed anti-E antibodies in 4 patients. Plasma from these four patients with a nascent anti -E all showed no reactivity with DTT treated cells. Plasma from fourteen patients with a long history of anti-E (greater than 6 months) did react with the DTT treated cells. Conclusion: DTT treatment eliminates DARA interference as previously described, but also unexpectedly lessens the ability of treated cells to react with nascent anti-E. Because of the negative testing with some of the alloanti E antibodies, DARA-treated patients at UCM will be given both Kell and E negative blood if they have immunohematology testing performed using DTT reagent cells.",

Cases and controls were tested for the RBC antigens Fy a and Fy b phenotype using serologic methods. The Fy phenotype, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin level, platelet count, and medical diagnoses were extracted from the medical record. Where appropriate, data were compared statistically using the Mann-Whitney U Test with significance set at P<0.05. Results/Finding: Subjects who were clinically identified as having probable BEN included 7 patients (mean age 48.7; all self-identified as African-American; 6/7 were male) and controls included 50 patients (mean age 68.5; 10 self-identified as African American; (50/50 male). All of the cases (100%) diagnosed with BEN had Fy(a-b-) phenotype. Mean ANC (1.95x10 3 /uL) and WBC counts (4.04x10 3 /uL) were significantly lower in the cases with BEN and Fy(a-b-) phenotype (P50.0008 and 0.001, respectively) compared with controls (mean ANC 5 5.46x10 3 /uL ; mean WBC count 5 8.14x10 3 /uL). There was no significant difference in mean platelet counts (161x10 3 /uL vs 213x10 3 /uL; P50.2301) or mean hemoglobin levels (12.4 g/dL vs 11.7 g/dL; P50.6031) between the two groups. None of the patients with BEN had an accompanying marrow-suppressive hematologic disorder based on record review; however, 18 subjects in the control group had accompanying conditions that were potentially marrow-suppressive including hepatocellular carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Conclusion: Testing for Fy phenotype could potentially be used as a surrogate test in patients with chronic neutropenia in a correct ethnic and clinical setting for the diagnosis of BEN. Further studies regarding Fy phenotyping comparing controls with neutropenia for any reason to our BEN population are in progress to better determine the positive predictive value. These tests were compared to the ProVUE for concordance. Additional samples tested with Anti-IgG,-C3d were correlated against tube testing for the DAT and antigen typing for: C, c, E, e, and K. Results/Findings: The IH-1000 had 100% concordance for all blood grouping assays. For AHG assays, the IH-1000 detected an anti-Jka1E, anti-Fya 1 warm antibody, antibody to a high incidence antigen and a warm antibody that were missed by the ProVUE. The IH-1000 identified one additional anti-E not identified on the ProVUE. Discrepancies were also noted with the non-cord DAT results.

We evaluated two monoclonal anti-e reagents with comparator reagent using a large panel of molecular confirmed Rh e variants. Study Design/Method: Two monoclonal anti-e clones, RD9/4 and RD12/2, and a licensed comparator anti-e (P3GD5121MS63), all from Diagast (Loos, France), were evaluated. RBC samples were either recovered from frozen storage (N 5 42) or EDTA blood from donors (N 5 72) and were tested using a manual tube method or on a PK7300 automated platform. A score 6 (11) or greater was deemed acceptable for manual tube and a positive call for automated testing. Results were tabulated by complexity of RHCE*ce alleles (Table 1) . Results/Finding: The specificity of the monoclonal anti-e were confirmed using common Rhce haplotypes: R 1 R 1 , R 2 R 2 , R 1 r, and rr. Twenty-one different RHCE*ce alleles were included in the extensive panel: 40 were RHCE*ce that were in trans to RHCE*cE; 16 were various RHCE*ce plus RHCE*ce48C compound heterozygotes; 31 were RHCE*ce or RHCE*Ce homozygotes; 27 were various RHCE*ce and RHCE*Ce compound heterozygotes. The comparator reagent was negative or unacceptably weak for 6 RHCE*ce alleles in trans to RHCE*cE (RHCE*ceAR, RHCE*ceMO, RHCE*-ceJAL, RHCE*ceHAR), with 1 RHCE*ceAR/RHCE*ce48C compound heterozygote, and with 1 RHCE*ceCF homozygote. RHCE*ceAR, RHCE*ceMO, RHCE*ceJAL, and 1 of 2 RHCE*ceCF homozygotes were detected using the comparator reagent. RD9/4 and RD12/2 failed with 4 and 1 e variants, respectively (Table 1) . Failure to detect the e variants was observed using both manual tube and automated methods for the comparator and the RD9/4 clone. None of the reagents detected e antigen variant expressed on 1 example of RHCE*ceHAR/RHCE*cE. Conclusion: RD9/4 and RD12/2 anti-e reacted with more e variants than the comparator reagent. The e antigen encoded by RHCE*JAL and RHCE*AR is not always detected when in trans to RHCE*cE. However, double-dose expression was detected suggesting that the 3 monoclonal reagents bind weakly to the respective altered e antigen epitopes. The e antigen encoded by RHCE*ceHAR continues to be a challenge to detect.",

OBRR, CBER, FDA Background/Case Studies: Extended molecular typing of a large number of blood donors can increase the likelihood of identifying donor red blood cells (RBCs) that match those of the recipient. This is especially important in the management of chronically-transfused patients and patients with RBC alloantibodies. Several high-throughput multiplex blood group molecular typing platforms have been developed to determine blood group antigen phenotypes. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides comprehensive sequence information focusing on specified genomic regions, and allows the simultaneous detection of genetic variants from multiple genes in a large number of samples. We developed and evaluated targeted NGS assays using two different target enrichment platforms for extended blood group genotyping. Study Design/Method: Two custom design platforms SureSelect and Halo-Plex were used independently for preparation of probes that target the entire genes of 19 blood group genes associated with the expression of 56 blood group antigens from 17 blood group systems. We used the Illumina's HiSeq 2000/2500 system to perform next generation sequencing first on SureSelect-enriched genes from 16 DNA reference samples with average target design coverage of 97.5%, and then on HaloPlex-enriched genes from 32 DNA reference samples with average target design coverage above 97.0%. Twelve samples were enriched and sequenced in both methods to allow a direct comparison. All reference samples were previously characterized for 38 blood group genetic variants in these 19 genes using TaqMan SNP assay and Sanger Sequencing assay. Serological data were also available for these samples. The NGS data were analyzed by CLC Genomic Workbench. Sequencing variants were detected and annotated using dbSNP database. Blood group genotype calls by the two targeted NGS methods were compared with the reference results. Results/Finding: For the two targeted NGS methods, we evaluated and compared the target enrichment efficiency, off-target enrichment, quality of NGS, sequencing coverage, and genotype concordance. A higher percentage of the HaloPlex reads (80.54%) were mapped to the target regions relative to the SureSelect reads (29.23%). The mean sequence coverage depth of the targeted bases was around 200x for SureSelect method and 300x for HaloPlex method. Some exons, such as RHD exons 4 and 8, 10, RHCE exon 10, ERMAP exons 5 and 12, CD55 exons 10 and 11, CR1 gene (most exons) and GYPB exon 5, are consistently covered with less than 10x coverage by both SureSelect and HaloPlex targeted NGS methods. Both methods detected RHD gene deletion in a few representative samples. The genotype call concordance on 38 blood group genetic variants was assessed by comparing NGS results to TaqMan genotyping and Sanger sequencing results, and more than 90% concordance was obtained for both targeted NGS methods. Incorrect calls were restricted to four complex blood group genes: MNS, RHD, RHCE and ABO, and involved mainly heterozygous variants and indels. Conclusion: Using two targeted NGS methods, we have correctly detected more than 90% blood group genetic variants in 19 selected genes.",

New information can be elucidated when two altered alleles or haplotypes are expressed in an individual with subsequent alloantibody formation. The RHCE*ceHAR allele was first described in 1996 and has a phenotype of C2E2c1e1 w f1 w , G2, Hr 0 1 w , Hr2, hr S 2, Rh:33, Rh:50 with a partial D antigen expression. We describe new information regarding an RH haplotype that includes an RHCE*ceHAR allele and its apparent Rh:234 (Hr B 2) expression. Study Design/Method: RBC typing was performed by standard tube methods with polyclonal and monoclonal antisera. Antibody identification studies were performed by standard tube hemagglutination methods by published techniques. Molecular immunohematology testing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from whole blood and included HEA, RHD and RHCE BeadChips (Immucor) and PCR-RFLP analysis for RHCE c.254C>G and RHD c.1136C>T. Results/Finding: A sample from an African American female with a history of an anti-E and anti-K was evaluated for unexpected antibodies. Her red cell serologic Rh phenotype on an untransfused sample was D1C1E2c1e1. Her plasma contained an alloanti-S and an antibody that reacted strongly with all random E2K2S2 reagent red cells except her own. The unidentified reactivity persisted following ficin and DTT pretreatment of reagent red cells. Only D22 and Dc2 red cells were non-reactive in initial tests. Differential adsorption studies excluded antibodies to all other common antigens and hr B except E, S and K. When subsequent examples of E2S2K2 red cells homozygous for the RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D, RHCE*-ce48C,733G,1006T haplotype (i.e., r' S /r' S ) and RHD*DIIIa, RHCE*-ce48C,733G,1006T/ RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D, RHCE*ce48C,733G,1006T (i.e., Bastiaan genotype) were found to be non-reactive with the patient's plasma, the antibody specificity was determined to be anti-Hr B . The patient's red cell antigen genotype identified the following probable RH haplotypes: RHD*01, RHCE*ceHAR and RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D, RHCE*ce48C,733G,1006T. Additional antigen typing of the patient's red cells with unlicensed antisera indicated an Hr1 (2 of 2 sources) and Hr B 2 (2 of 3 sources) phenotype. Conclusion: The RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D, RHCE*ce48C,733G,1006T haplotype is one of the RH haplotypes expressed by the original Hr B 2 individual Bastiaan. The Hr B antigen status of red cells of individuals with the RHCE*-ceHAR allele has not been described. We report an individual with the probable RHD*01, RHCE*ceHAR and RHD*DIIIa-CE(4-7)-D, RHCE*ce48C,733G,1006T RH haplotypes and production of alloanti-Hr B . The specificity of the alloantibody produced and the red cell Hr B serologic antigen type supports the conclusion the variant allele RHCE*ceHAR does not encode for the Hr B antigen.",

All patient samples with available records of the full serological investigation were reviewed for testing method and results, with specific attention to the value of a given test method in permitting exclusion of clinically significant AB (rule out). Results/Findings: Over approximately 11 years, 81 patients had HTLA established at least once by titration studies. Serological investigations on a total of 118 samples using a combination of gel, SP, and PEG and LISS tube methods, and occasional DTT and ficin panels, found that HTLA interference noted most frequently in gel (primary method) was, indeed, less often seen with SP. However, the proportion of cases achieving rule out on SP was no greater than that with PEG testing (Table) . For samples where rule out could not be performed with a combination of methods, patients were assigned to phenotype-matched transfusions, or testing was referred to a reference laboratory. Reference testing on 20 samples was successful in rule out in 60% of cases. In an additional 12 patient samples, with negative antibody screens, HTLA were identified upon work-up for incompatible crossmatches. Conclusion: SP is useful in avoiding interference from HTLA, but this conclusion is limited because SP was performed in only 40% of samples, and the inability to use select cell panels with SP made it difficult to complete rule out on samples containing multiple AB. PEG testing was available for 71% of samples, and was at least as effective. Further, manual testing allowed flexibility in selecting test cells when other AB were present. Both SP and PEG testing may be used alone or in combination to avoid interference due to HTLA, and can potentially decrease the number of patients requiring phenotype-matched units due to incomplete serological evaluations. Background/Case Studies: The DAU family of RHD alleles is characterized by c.1136C>T (p.Thr379Met). The DAU0 allele harbors only this change, is not associated with depressed or altered D antigen expression, and is the ancestral allele from which other DAU alleles are purported to have evolved. Srivastava et al (Transfusion 2016, 56:2520) recently summarized serologic characteristics and associated anti-D alloimmunization for 18 DAU family alleles. We investigated two samples with the c.1136C>T change referred with weak D antigen expression. Study Design/Method: Serologic testing was performed by standard tube methods using licensed anti-D reagents and the ALBAclone partial RhD typing kit. Genomic DNA was isolated from WBCs and used in manual and array assays and for amplification and sequencing RHD. Results/Finding: Sample 1 was from a 17 yo multiracial female. Her RBCs reacted 11 S at immediate spin (IS) and 31 in IAT with Immucor Gammaclone and Series 4 and 5, and mi1 at IS and 41 in IAT with Ortho BioClone anti-D. RBCs did not react with 2 of 12 (LHM 174/102 & 57/17) anti-D in the partial D typing kit. This pattern did not match any of the defined partial D epitope patterns. RHD BeadChip found no changes but RFLP detected c.1136C>T characteristic of DAU. RHD sequencing confirmed c.1136C>T and identified two adjacent changes, c.787G>T and c.788G>T (c.787_788delinsTT), in exon 5 encoding p.Gly263Leu. Sample 2 RBCs reacted 1w at IAT with both Ortho BioClone and Quotient ALBAclone Delta, but were non-reactive with Immucor Gamma-clone, Series 4 and 5, and Quotient ALBAclone blend and alpha anti-D. Papain treated RBCs were 11s in IAT with Ortho BioClone. These results suggested a D el like phenotype. RHD BeadChip found no changes but RFLP detected c.1136C>T. Sequencing confirmed c.1136C>T and found a new c.761C>T change (p.Ser254-Leu) in exon 5. The c.761T has not been reported, but c.761G encodes a stop codon (p.Ser254Stop) in Japanese (Vox Sang 2015, 109:359). Conclusion: We report two new alleles: RHD with c.787_788delinsTT (p.Gly263Leu) and RHD with c.761C>T (p.Ser254Leu), both also carrying the c.1136C>T (p.Thr379Met) characteristic of the African DAU cluster. D antigen associated with p.263Leu is a partial D antigen with a novel epitope pattern. The p.254Leu change is associated with a Del-like phenotype, the first observed to our knowledge for a DAU allele, and D antigen on the RBCs is not detected in IAT by 5/7 commercial anti-D. The RHD nucleotide changes reported here are not in dbSNP database. This study brings the DAU family of alleles to 21. The number and diversity of alleles in the DAU cluster supports that the c.1136C>T change is a major ancestral African background allele (Wagner et al, Blood 2002,100:306).",

By analysis of genotype of the blood component, all of them were confirmed as Asian type DEL. For that reason, the application of genetic analysis for the blood donor has been required in addition to serological assay. We established the algorithm for the genetic analysis of RHDin blood donors. In this study, we would introduce the experience of the application of the algorithm and the results in the preliminary test. Study Design/Method: From September 2016 to present day we got 130 samples of repeated blood donors who are known to be D negative, C positive and/or E negative from 15 blood centers. We obtained the consent for the test from all of the donors who provided samples. As a genetic analysis, we accomplished polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) for the region of promoter, exon 4, exon 7 and exon 10 in RHD gene. Based on the results of PCR-SSP, we discriminated the results into total RHD deletion, RHD-CE-D hybrid and RHD variant. When the results were discriminated to be RHD variant, we additionally analyzed the sequence of exon 9 to confirm the existence of c.1227G>A and c.1222T>A variations. For the sample with indeterminate results, we performed sequencing for the full region of exon. When the result was confirmed to be RHD deletion or RHD-CE-D hybrid, the blood components were regarded as RhD negative. When the result was confirmed to be RHDvariant, the blood components were regarded as RhD positive. Blood components were not supplied until the final results were obtained. Results/Finding: For the 130 sample, we identified 71 cases (54.6%) of total RHD deletion, 18 cases (13.8%) of RHD-CE-D hybrid, and 41 cases (31.5%) of RHD variant. 39 of RHD variant were determined to be Asian type DEL with c.1227G>A variation. 2 cases of RHDvariant were regarded to be unknown variation. Conclusion: The frequency of RHD variant in this study was 10 % higher than that of the general D negative donors not considering RhCE phenotype in a previous study. For that reason, we considered that the genetic analysis of RHD targeting the donors of D negative, C positive and/or E negative is more efficient approach to identify RHD variant and better way to improve blood safety in the transfusion medicine related with RhD negative blood donors.",

Taipei Blood Center, Taiwan Blood Services Foundation Background/Case Studies: Certain ABO subgroups or physiologic conditions may lead to mixed-field agglutination on ABO typing among blood donors. The B 3 phenotype was found to be the most common subgroup in Taiwanese. However, it is hard to distinguish the B 3 phenotype from other B subtypes also with mixed-field agglutination using routine serology without the genotype. This study aimed to evaluate if flow cytometric method could alternatively differentiate different B subtypes with mixed-field agglutination rather than using molecular genotyping. Study Design/Method: Blood samples from 30 Taiwanese blood donors exhibiting known common ABO phenotypes were included to establish normal flow cytometric patterns and genotyped. Blood samples (n552) from B subtype donors with mixed-field agglutination by routine serology (tube method and gel card) were further analyzed by flow cytometry and genotyping. Flow cytometric method was performed by FACSCalibur flow cytometry using the Gamma-clone anti-A and -B. For genotyping, exon 6 and exon 7 of the ABO gene were amplified and sequenced. The ABO*B3.03 allele was confirmed by PCR-RFLP analysis. Results/Finding: Among 52 subjects with B 3 or AB 3 phenotypes, 47 were genotyped as ABO*B3.03. The ABO*B3.03 group performed similar characteristic flow cytometric pattern and the profile was reproducible over time. The pattern showed the main population of cells expressed no B antigen, while a percentage (37.81 6 6.62) of the RBCs exhibited B antigen levels diminishing with increasing of fluorescence. Other 5 subjects with B 3 or AB 3 subjects, genotyped as ABO*B3.06(n51), ABO*BW.03(n51), ABO*BW.11(n51), ABO*BW.12(n51) and ABO*BW.29(n51), displayed flow patterns differed from the ABO*B3.03 group. The ABO*BW.03, ABO*BW.11 and ABO*B3.06 subjects also showed a main population of cells expressed no B antigen and, however, less percentage of RBCs exhibited B antigen levels (<10% in ABO*BW.03 and ABO*BW.11 subjects and <20% in ABO*B3.06 subject). Both ABO*BW.12 and ABO*BW.29 displayed a wedge-shaped pattern. Conclusion: The flow cytometric method for the detection of B antigens on RBC might be useful in discriminating between B subtypes with mixed-field agglutination, especially ABO*B3.03 genotype. This approach could assist the serological ABO subgrouping in clinical reference laboratory.",

The data available from parallel testing on solid-phase, Gel, and PEG performed at another cite of the same hospital system was collected and evaluated to determine the frequencies and specificities of \"solid-phase only\" detected erythrocyte antibodies and to see if solid-phase only antibody workup is necessary for patient care. Study Design/Methods: Throughout 2016, the transfusion service used automated solid-phase red blood cell (RBC) adherence as the primary method for antibody screening and identification. All solid-phase antibody screen positive samples were re-tested using both Gel column agglutination and PEG method manually in order to determine which method should be used for antiglobulin phase crossmatch of RBC products. All antibody screen results on three methods and final antibody identification results were transcribed into a spread sheet and analyzed. Results/Findings: A total of 398 patients were positive on solid-phase antibody screen and re-tested on Gel and PEG antibody screen. In 12% (n549) patients antibody reactivity observed in solid phase only and the concurrent Gel and PEG testing were completely negative. Of them clinically significant RBC alloantibodies, warm autoantibodies, clinically insignificant antibodies were identified in 22% (n511), 4% (n52), and 74% (n536) of the cases, respectively. RBC alloantibodies identified in solid-phase only included anti-E (n54), anti-Jka (n53), anti-K (n52), anti-Jkb (n51), both anti-E and Anti-C (n51) (see Table 1 ). Conclusion: Solid-phase only RBC antibodies are clinically important in a significant portion of cases (roughly 1 in 4 cases). Workup for solid-phase only antibodies is not \"unnecessary\" workload.

The study of FY variants in the low altitude and tropical Gambela region is important, as malaria is endemic and the endogenous population is living in this region for a long time. In the present study, we determined the full length nucleotide sequence of the ACKR1 gene encoding FY antigens in donors from Ethiopia's southwestern Gambela region. Study Design/Method: EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood was collected from study 60 volunteers in the Gambela region (NCT01282021). The whole ACKR1 gene was amplified in one reaction covering 12,125 base pairs (bp). This primary amplicon was re-amplified using nested primers covering 5782 nucleotides. Nucleotide sequence was obtained by 14 sequencing reactions and manually annotated using NCBI RefSeq NG_011626.2. The sequencing covered 1008 bp of both exons, 480 bp of intron, 2101 bp of 5'-flanking region, 947 bp of 5'-UTR, 53 bp of 3'-UTR and 1092 bp of 3'-flanking region and encompassed all the 470 variations present in dbSNP and NHLBI ESP databases. Results/Finding: Among the 60 samples, a total of 15 SNPs, including one novel SNP in 5'-UTR were observed. 4 SNPs occurred in the exons, 5 in 5'and 3'flanking region, 4 in 5'-UTR and 2 in the intron. All 60 individuals carried the SNP indicative of the common FY:2 phenotype; while 58 individuals were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous for the GATA box mutation. No splice site mutation was detected. As 46 individuals were observed as being homozygous or heterozygous for 1 SNP, we could unambiguously assign 8 distinct alleles. In the remaining 14 individuals with 2 or more heterozygous SNPs, allele specific PCR is required to identify the alleles. Conclusion: We sequenced more than 5.5 kb of the ACKR1 gene and identified at least 8 different alleles. The present study found that the vast majority of alleles (117/120) in the Gambela population as defined by 15 SNPs, were similar to the clinically relevant FY*02N.01 allele, which in turn is defined by only 2 SNPs at positions c.1-67T>C and c.125G>A. Out of the remaining 3 alleles, 2 were similar to FY*02 with the Fy(b1) phenotype and 1 was similar to FY*02W.01 with the Fy x phenotype. The high frequency of FY*02N.01 (95%) in this study is similar to other studies conducted in Western, central and south-eastern regions from Gambia to Mozambique (95%-100%). A more detailed analysis, including other regions of Ethiopia, will be useful to support transfusion care in the US for Ethiopian-Americans, the majority of whom may be of mixed Ethiopian ethnical background.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The KEL blood group system, consisting of 36 antigens encoded by the KEL gene, is organized into 19 exons. There are approximately 30 KEL alleles associated with a Kell null phenotype (K 0 ) in which no Kell antigens are expressed, and 12 alleles associated with a Kell mod phenotype (K mod ). Individuals with the K mod phenotype express very weak amounts of antigen on the surface of the RBC, and expression levels vary based on the allele present. Here we describe the molecular and serologic testing that was performed in the case of a 53 year-old Hispanic male blood donor whose RBCs phenotyped K-k-Js(b-) Kp(b-). Study Design/Method: The blood donor was phenotyped for K, k, Kp b and Js b antigens using standard tube agglutination methods. Adsorption and elution studies of the donor red cells were performed using commercial anti-k antisera (American National Red Cross). Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from an EDTA blood tube using standard techniques. DNA was genotyped for human erythrocyte antigens using the PreciseType TM HEA Molecular BeadChip (Immucor). Exons 10, 11, 12,13 and 14 and flanking intron sequences were amplified and sequenced. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (QIAGEN) and KEL cDNA was amplified and the resulting PCR product was subjected to Sanger sequence analysis and aligned using Sequencher (GeneCodes). Results/Finding: PreciseType TM HEA Molecular BeadChip testing predicted the sample to be K-k1 Kp(a-b1) Js(a-b1). KEL-cDNA sequence analysis was performed and detected a single transcript species with c.578C, c.841C, 1790T, and missing the sequences corresponding to exons 11, 12 and 13. Amplification of the exons from gDNA did not identify any nucleotide changes when compared to the reference sequence and the splice sites were intact. cDNA analysis was repeated and the same aberrant transcript was detected. Adsorption and elution studies of the k antigen demonstrated weak anti-k reactive after 37C incubation at the PEG-IgG-AGT phase. Conclusion: Here we describe a donor homozygous for a novel KEL*02 allele. This donor was presumed to have a K 0 phenotype based on serology, but after molecular testing, has been reclassified as a K mod phenotype with extremely weak expression of k. The discovery of the aberrant transcript led to adsorption and elution studies to confirm the presence of weakly expressed k antigen on the red cells. The 11 variant alleles reported to date (http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/red-cell-immunogenetics-and-bloodgroup-terminology/) are associated with missense mutations. In contrast, the allele reported here is associated aberrant mRNA transcript. We propose that this allele be named KEL*02M.12. Here we report a case of a possible novel B subgroup observed in a pregnant black female. The patient specimen was referred to our reference laboratory to investigate a possible ABO discrepancy. The referring facility reported the patient's red blood cells were nonreactive with reagent anti-A and anti-B and the patient's plasma was reactive with A cells, but nonreactive with B cells using automated gel methodology. Study Design/Methods: Serological testing of the patient's red blood cells was performed using routine and enhancement methods. Molecular testing by PCR-RFLP was performed to determine the patient's genetic ABO typing and predicted ABO phenotype. Results/Findings: Serological testing of the patient's red blood cells is summarized in Table 1 ; similar results were obtained with multiple sources of antisera. Enzyme treatment failed to enhance reactivity. Patient sera strongly agglutinated A1 and A2 cells, but failed to agglutinate multiple sources of B cells at all phases of testing.",

Negative or weak reactions are generally related to the 17-bp deletion in SMIM1 in homozygous or heterozygous status. However, other nucleotide changes have been described to reduce the Vel expression, as for example, the major A allele of the SNP rs1175550 located in the second intron of the gene, a regulatory region in erythroblasts. This study aimed to characterize the genetic changes related to atypical Vel expression in a Brazilian population. Study Design/Method: A total of 400 blood donor samples from the Southeast region of Brazil were typed for Vel with an anti-Vel serum from our inventory in GEL-IAT. Samples typed as Vel-negative were further analyzed by adsorption-elution. Molecular study was performed in samples with negative results, in samples reacting 21 and in samples with reactivity of 31.

Genotyping results showed that the 4 samples with negative results and 5 of 26 samples that presented 21 reaction were heterozygous for the 17 bp deletion and presented the A allele rs1175550 in homozygous status. From the 21 of 26 remaining samples with reactivity of 21, 19 (90%) had the A allele of rs1175550 and 14 (66.7%) had the A allele of rs6673829. In contrast, in the 16 samples with stronger reactions we found the A allele of rs1175550 in 5 (31.25%) samples and the A allele of rs6673829 in 3 (18.75%) samples. Conclusion: The molecular changes rs6673829 and rs1175550 are located in intron 2 distancing 38 nucleotides. This study reinforces the association of the A allele of rs1175550 with reduction of Vel expression and suggests the involvement of a new rs6673829 change in Vel expression. In conclusion, the several patterns of Vel expression found in different populations can be influenced by different molecular changes. Background/Case Studies: The D antigen is the most immunogenic antigen after ABO. Consequences of misclassification of the D-antigen in patients or donors can be severe. Some persons inherit mutations resulting in quantitative reductions of D antigen on the cell surface (weak D), some inherit Rh haplotypes that result in biochemical effects that reduce the availability of the D antigens to reagent anti-sera (Ceppellini effect), and others inherit D genes which are qualitatively different than wild type D. These latter individuals are often not identified until after they have formed anti-D. We hypothesize that some of these persons at risk of forming anti-D might be uncovered if they have weak and/or disparate D typing results with reagents that recognize different epitopes of the D antigen. Study Design/Methods: All testing was performed using microtiter-well direct agglutination on the GalileoNEO or GalileoEcho (Immucor, Norcross,GA). Any specimen that did not react as 0 (Rh Negative), or !31 on the NEO or !21 on the Echo (Rh Positive) for both series 4 and series 5 anti-D antisera were included. Patients with discrepant historical types also were evaluated. Any specimens meeting the inclusion criteria were tested on the NEO, Echo, and by saline tube method using series 4 and series 5 anti-D antisera. Genotyping was performed from whole blood samples sent to Immucor genotyping laboratory in Warren, NJ using an algorithm of: RHD BeadChip, RHDxp (prototype assay), RHD zygosity, and RHCE BeadChip. Results/Findings: 80 patients met inclusion criteria for molecular testing for the D antigen. Weak or RhD variants were identified in 51 of 80 (63.7%) of the samples. Ceppellini effect (i.e. C in trans to RHD) resulting in weak D reactivity was seen in 16 of 80 (20%) of samples. 67 of 80 (83.8%) of the samples that resulted in weak or discrepant reactivity had some type of genetic cause that was resolved by using our algorithm. 40 of 80 (50%) of tested samples had results indicating weak/variant D proteins with the potential to cause alloimmunization to the D antigen. The remaining 13 of 80 (17.3%) samples did not have identified genetic cause for the weak and/or discrepant D test results and were presumptively classified as wild type D. Conclusion: Transfusion services that use the GalileoNEO or GalileoEcho to perform Rh typing should consider molecular testing of patients whose Rh typing results are discrepant, or positive but <31 on the GalileoNEO or positive but <21 on the GalileoEcho, as about half of these patients can develop anti-D. This is particularly relevant for females of child-bearing potential where avoidance of D-positive transfusions and administration of RhIg during pregnancy is prudent until their D typing can be confirmed by molecular testing.",

Many variant Rh proteins have been described and most of them affect the integration of Rh proteins in the membrane. D antigen expression can be affected by several molecular changes and also by the RHCEhaplotypes. The present study investigated the score of reactivity of samples presenting a strong reduction in D expression. Study Design/Method: A total of 108 samples were included in the study, being 69 previously genotyped as RHD*DAR1.2, 37 RHD*DAR3.1 and 2 RHD*DAU6. The samples were phenotyped in NeoV R (Immucor) to D, C/c and E/e antigens by direct agglutinationin microplate. Results obtained in NeoV R were expressed in a score from 0 -99 corresponding to the reaction intensity. Zygosity assay was performed by a multiplex real-time quantitative PCR using a set of RHD-specific primers in RHD exon 10. RHCE genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP and SSP-PCR.

Background/Case Studies: Drugs are known to interfere with routine blood bank testing. A novel monoclonal humanized 5F9 antibody (Hu5F9-G4) that binds human CD47 has been entered into clinical trials for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumors. We describe two cases of patients treated with Hu5F9-G4 (anti-CD47) who had ABO discrepancy with extra-reactivity in the reverse typing and a panaggutinin in the plasma. Study Design/Method: This is a retrospective review of two cases with immunohematology work-up showing ABO discrepancy and plasma panagglutinin. The first case is of a 69 year old female with progressive follicular lymphoma who was enrolled in Phase 1b/2 Trial of Hu5F9 G4 in combination with rituximab designed for patients with relapsed/refractory B cell NHL. She had no prior transfusion history and her historical blood type was not known. Two RBC units were requested in anticipation for a surgical procedure. The second case is of a 48 year old male with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma enrolled in Hu5F9-G4 clinical trial. His historical blood type was A Rh D positive with a negative antibody screen. He received three RBC units within the past month prior to testing and receiving the anti-CD47 therapy. Results/Finding: The ABO typing in the first case showed a discrepancy between the forward typing (41 with anti-A, non-reactive with anti-B) and the reverse typing (31 with both A 1 cells and B cells). RhD typing was positive. The extended reagent RBC panel tested with the patient's serum reacted with all cells tested at the immediate spin (IS) phase (11 to 41), at LISS-37C (11 to 31), at LISS-polyspecific AHG (m1), and at PEG-anti-IgG (m1 to 11). Plasma reactivity at IS persisted with DTT or ficin treated red cells and was not removed by cold autoadsorption, cold alloadsorption, or RESt adsorption. Repeat testing, which avoided the IS and 37C readings, was non-reactive in the antihuman globulin (AHG) phase using both LISS and PEG enhancements, ruling out clinically significant alloantibodies directed toward common red blood cell antigens. The Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) and autocontrol were negative. The RBC units issued to the patient were crossmatch compatible at 37 o C AHG phase.",

Conclusion: Anti-CD47 therapy interferes with Blood Bank testing by causing ABO discrepancies and panagglutinin reactivity in the plasma at IS, 37C LISS, but not at AHG phase using Gamma-clone Anti-IgG, unlike the anti-CD38 interference. Knowledge of patient's blood type and phenotype before starting this therapy is critical for providing safe blood. Background/Case Studies: A middle-aged male with discrepant ABO typing results was investigated. Initial forward typing was group O but no anti-B was seen in the reverse typing. An unexpected 31 reaction was noted with an anti-A,B reagent. Genotyping surprisingly showed ABO*O.01.01/ O.01.01, consistent with group O. After initial testing at the referring center, samples were sent for extended analysis. Study Design/Method: Standard serological methods and flow cytometry were used. A panel of ABO reagents (n523) and lectins were tested with both native and papain-treated red blood cells (RBCs). Lewis phenotyping was performed, as was genetic testing for ABO, GBGT1 and A4GALT. Papain-treated patient RBCs were used to screen donor plasmas (n578) and two reactive plasmas were DTT-treated. Results/Finding: Positive reactions were obtained with 3 polyclonal anti-A,B and a monoclonal anti-B (clone G1/2) when tested with the patient's papain-treated RBCs. A panel of lectins gave negative results. Genetic testing confirmed the predicted group O and ruled out the presence of FORS1 or NOR antigens. The patient was Le(a-b1) and thus a secretor.",

Conclusion: The medical history of the patient was queried and he had indeed undergone an HSCT $15 years earlier. The reactions are likely due to uptake of recipient-derived BLe b (type 1) antigen (ISBT no. 007006), which is the dominant Lewis antigen in the recipient's original blood group, B Le(a-b1). Interestingly, B-zyme did not affect BLe b . Anti-BLe b is not simply anti-B plus anti-Le b but an inseparable and rarely reported specificity, which appears to be common among group O donors. The phenomenon reported here has unknown clinical implications but highlights the complexities of carbohydrate blood groups. Background/Case Studies: The ProVUEV R and VisionV R (Ortho Scientific, Raritan New Jersey) automated analyzer use MTS-Gel TM card technology to perform immunohematology testing. Benefits of automated testing include improved efficiency and enhanced reliability. After eight years of using the ProVUEV R our Transfusion Medicine service switched to the ORTHO VisionV R analyzer in January of 2017. Shortly after implementation, technologists reported increased time spent performing manual resolution of indeterminate (designated as \"?\") results. Additionally, some test columns were noted to be visually negative but called positive (11) by the analyzer. The objective of this study was to investigate the cause of \"?\" and apparent false positive results on VisionV R three-cell antibody screens. Study Design/Methods: With assistance from Ortho Diagnostics, analyzer archives were queried to identify the number of gel card columns used for screens, the number of columns with \"?\" results, and the gel card lot numbers used for testing from 1/29/2017 to 3/31/2017. Reactivity was determined to be false positive based on supervisory review of digital images and antibody panel results. Investigation also included review of daily QC records, instrument maintenance, instrument diagnostics, and camera calibration. Results/Findings: Of 19,647 columns run as part of antibody screens, 1,633 (8.3%) columns generated \"?\" results. Assuming 30 seconds of technologist time per \"?\", we estimate that 13.6 hours were needed to resolve and update these results. Among all potential causes investigated, only the gel card lot number was associated with the number of \"?\" generated (table 1) .",

This may be due to the washing phase in this technique which dissipates rouleaux formation. Reactivity due to cold reactive antibodies can be eliminated by performance at strict 378C. Our practice is now to use both DTT IAT methods on initial patient referral, if residual reactivity in GC is observed use LISS tube in preference thereafter in these patients.

Westhoff 1 . 1 Immunohematology and Genomics Laboratory, New York Blood Center, 2 Blood Centers of the Pacific, 3 BloodSource Background/Case Studies: Recombination events have generated many GYPA and GYPB hybrids giving rise to glycophorin (GP) variants that express low-prevalence antigens (e.g. Mia, MINY, Mur). In rare individuals who are homozygous these alleles are associated with lack of highprevalence antigens (e.g. ENKT, ENEH, ENAV). Complex hybrid recombination events can make it challenging to elucidate specific alleles present in samples, particularly heterozygotes. We investigated samples from a pregnant Asian (Hmong) woman with an antibody to an unidentified highprevalence MNS antigen, and samples from her sister. Study Design/Method: Standard methods were used for RBC typing with licensed and unlicensed reagents and for antibody identification. DNA was isolated from WBCs, and HEA PreciseType, exon-specific amplification and sequencing GYPB exons 1-6, and long range sequencing of exon 2-6 (5.4kb amplicon) were performed. SNP-specific primers were used to associate changes (phasing) to specific alleles. Results/Finding: RBCs of the pregnant proband typed S-s-(Gammaclone anti-s), and the plasma reactivity was consistent with an antibody to a high Background/Case Studies: The RhD antigen is clinically significant and immunogenic and therefore individuals who develop anti-D are at risk of haemolytic transfusion reaction. RHD polymorphism shows substantial ethnic variability and at least 100 RHD variants associated with weak D alleles have been reported. In this study, we report two new RHD alleles in Brazilian blood donors associated with weak D antigen expression. Study Design/Method: The D status was evaluated with 4 commercially available monoclonal anti-D reagents: 1 blended IgM/IgG (clones TH-28/ MS-26), 2 IgM (clones MS201 and P3x61) and 1 IgG (MS26) in tube and on gel cards. C, c, E and e phenotyping were performed in gel. Most common weak D and partial D alleles were investigated by allele specific (AS) PCR and with the RHD BeadChip platform from Immucor. Direct automated sequencing of the 10 RHD exons and flanking intron regions was performed by the Sanger dideoxy method. In order to determine RHD allelic combinations, we also performed Rh-cDNA cloning and sequencing. Background/Case Studies: Donors negative for multiple common antigens or lacking a high prevalence antigen are efficiently identified using a red blood cell (RBC) genotyping panel. When serology is used to confirm antigen negative status, discrepancies are identified, albeit rarely. Investigation of the discrepancy often leads to identification of variant antigens. It is known that the set of GYP variants associated with expression of the St a antigen can also be associated with N typing discrepancies in M1N-individuals (Meyer et al. Br J Haematol. 2016; 174:624-36) . The St a allele, also described as GYP*401, is a hybrid GYPB-GYPAtranscript with the crossover in intron 3. We sought to investigate five N typing discrepancies for which alternative genotyping methodology was performed and found to be concordant with the initial panel. Background/Case Studies: A sample from a 24 years old pregnant, African American female G1P0 was sent to the blood bank for ABO/Rh and antibody screen. The sample was analyzed using the Provue analyzer (Ortho Diagnostics). The patient was typed as O pos with no reverse type discrepancy. A retype of the same sample was performed using tube method with Biorad reagents per Hospital policy due to no previous ABO/Rh history on file. The retype showed that the patient was A subgroup with Anti-A 1 antibody present in the plasma. The sample was referred for genotyping, with the suspicion of A 3 like phenotype. Genetic testing did not support the serological findings of A 3 subgroup and a new ABO allele, ABO*784C that has never been reported in correlation with an A 3 like subgroup was detected Study Design/Method: The patient RBCs were typed with anti-A 1 (Immucor) and anti-A,B (Biorad and Grifols DG Gel). An Anti-A 1 antibody work up was performed using three different lots of A 1 cells and three lots of A 2 cells, as well as a type O screening cell and auto control . The tubes were read at IS and also incubated at RT and 48C for 30min. The patient 's initial antibody screen using Ortho gel was negative. Conclusion: The patient delivered a healthy baby boy at 35 weeks of gestation. The baby cord was sent to the laboratory. The baby serological type showed an A 3 B phenotype and it was referred for genetic testing. The baby RBCs showed the same ABO*784C found in the mother. The previously reported ABO*784A allele encoded an Aspartic Acid to Asparagine change at position p.256 consistent with an A weak phenotype. Also, at least five other alleles encoding an A 3 phenoytpe consisted of polymorphisms at positions c.745 through c.871, giving special characteristics to this new and unreported ABO allele. From the data collected, it can be concluded that this A3/ Aweak phenotype is encoded by the variant allele ABO*784C. This highlights the clinical relevance of confirming the serology of ABO subgroups by molecular methods.",

The commonly used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays require nucleic acid isolation which is typically achieved by extracting genomic DNA from whole blood. This method requires venipuncture and may not be an ideal approach for severely anemic patients or potential donors that are unable to provide a sample of whole blood due to their remote location. DNA extracted from buccal swab samples offers a noninvasive alternative to venipuncture and may provide a safe and efficient means of transporting samples from remote locations to reference laboratories for extended blood type prediction. Canadian Blood Services (CBS) has performed large scale DNA extraction and HLA genotyping for the OneMatch Stem Cell and Marrow Registry using buccal swabs since 2007; buccal swabs are also used by other unrelated donor stem cell registries, such as the US NMPD. We sought to assess the accuracy and reliability of using DNA extracted from buccal swabs in predicting blood group antigen expression. Study Design/Method: We performed parallel red cell genotyping on an automated typing platform, the Progenika/Grifols IDCoreXT assay (Progenika Biopharma-Grifols, Bizkaia, Spain) using DNA extracted from blood and buccal tissue from volunteers. For antigen systems with available serologic reagents, we also compared results with serologic typing. We evaluated three different methods of DNA extraction and performed testing regardless of DNA yield or purity. Two buccal swabs (Puritan Medical Products, Guilford, Maine) were used for each test. Swabs were stored at room temperature, and DNA extraction was performed within six days of collection. In the initial phase of the study, buccal swab samples (n 5 15) were processed with the automated Biorobot M48 Robot using the MagAttract DNA Mini M48 extraction method (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). Extracted DNA had a mean concentration and purity of 38.1ng/ml and 1.83 respectively. In the second phase of the study (n 5 39), DNA extractions from buccal swabs were performed using methods available in our national red cell immunohematology reference laboratory: the QIAamp DNA mini kit, using either manual or an automated QiaCube robotic workstation (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands).",

Multiple predictors of alloimmunization have been reported but not well replicated in large SCD cohorts. We investigated the clinical, laboratory and genetic predictors of alloimmunization. Study Design/Method: A large SCD cohort was established in Brazil to investigate disease outcomes. At participating sites, patients are currently transfused with ABO/D/Cc/Ee/Kell matched RBCs prophylactically and extended phenotypically matched RBC after first antibody forms. Policies for matching are center-specific and evolved to increased levels of matching over the exposure period included in this study. Transfused subjects with 11 RBC alloantibody of defined specificity within the cohort were compared to transfused antibody negative subjects using chi squared to compare categorical variables and T-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate to compare continuous variables. Backward elimination multivariable logistic modeling was used to generate odds ratios (OR) and identify independent predictors of alloimmunization using results of univariate analyses. All subjects had peripheral blood whole genome SNP typing performed using an Affymetrix array, which included enhanced content for blood related SNPs. Genome wide association (GWA) analyses were conducted using a logistic model to identify additive genetic effects associated with alloimmunization. A p value <50.05 (clinical analysis) or <5x10 -8 (GWA) was considered statistically significant. Results/Finding: Of the 2795 cohort patients, 2272 (81.3%) transfused subjects were included with 129 alloimmunized children <18 years (11.0% of 1172) and 224 alloimmunized adults (20.4% of 1100). In multivariable logistic regression models, age (OR 4.2, p50.009, for age 501 compared to 0-4), gender (OR 1.3, p50.04, for female compared to male), transfusion history (OR 3.5, p<0.0001, for 811 transfusions compared to 1-5), site, hemolysis (OR 1.3, p50.05, for log transformed lactate dehydrogenase) and presence of autoimmune disorders (OR 4.5, p<0.0001) were independent predictors of alloimmunization. GWA identified a single SNP of unclear biologic significance associated with alloimmunization (EEFSEC gene responsible for incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins). Conclusion: RBC alloimmunization is primarily driven by transfusion burden in this SCD cohort. Hemolysis remained significantly associated with alloimmunization after controlling for transfusions. Presence of an autoimmune disease was also associated with RBC alloimmunization, indicating more systemic immune dysregulation may be present in SCD patients who develop RBC alloantibodies.

There has been no published study to show if pre-transfusion test results of placental blood give the same result as the heel stick samples, which is the standard of practice. Study Design/Methods: Transfusion Service tested sample pairs from 32 newborns less than 2,000 gr birth weight. One of the samples was collected from the newborn as a heel stick sample, the other from the placenta. The following tests were performed on the sample pairs: ABO, Rh, antibody screen and Direct Antiglobulin Test with IgG (DAT). Results/Findings: ABO, Rh and DAT tests were performed on 32 sample pairs. DAT test was negative on 30 sample pairs and two were positive. There was 100% concordance with the ABO, Rh and DAT tests performed on these sample pairs. Antibody screen was performed on 32 placental blood samples and 29 heel stick samples. Twenty eight sample pairs were negative with the antibody screening test. There was one positive heel stick sample, which was also positive using the placental sample. One heel stick sample was negative for the presence of an antibody but found to be positive with the placental blood sample. This antibody which was detected only in the placental sample was a passive anti-D mother received during pregnancy. This discrepant result indicates that the placental blood sample was more sensitive to detect a weak antibody. Conclusion: This study shows that placental blood sample is not inferior to heel stick sample regarding ABO, Rh and DAT testing. Based on this comparison study placental blood can be used for pre-transfusion testing for < 2,000 g birth weight newborns. O-(7.4%), AB1(6.8%), B-(2.7%), and A-(0.6%). Among the tested donors, 89.2% were D positive with R1r being the most common Rh phenotype. In the Kell blood group system, 4.5% of the donors were K positive, while the k antigen was found to be 99.4%. The most common phenotype in the Duffy blood group system was Fy(a-b-), while the Fy(a1b1) was found at a higher frequency compared to what has been reported in the black population. (Table) The commonest phenotypes for the Kidd and MNS blood group systems were Jk(a1b1) and M1N-S1s1 at 47% and 22.6% respectively. The Le a 1 and Le b 1 alleles were seen in 21.7% and 67.3% of donors respectively, while Lu b -phenotype was found in 3.3% of the donors. The frequencies of the rare phenotypes Jk(a-b-), Le(a1b1) and Lu(a-b-) were 0.3% , 0.3% and 2.7% respectively, while the M1N-S-s-and M-N1S-s-phenotypes were not found. The frequency of the P1 antigen was found to be at 78.9% similar to what has been reported in Caucasians. Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the frequencies of RBC blood group phenotypes among the Omani blood donors. The results show higher frequencies of the rare null phenotypes Fy(a-b-), Jk(a-b-) and Lu(a-b-) compared to what has been reported in Caucasians. The frequencies of the Duffy blood group system resemble what has been reported in the black population. This data is helpful in understanding the influence of the Arab ethnic background on the RBC blood group systems and warrants large genotype-phenotype studies in the region.",

QualTex Laboratories Background/Case Studies: Rh(D) antibodies (anti-D) are developed in Rhnegative individuals when exposed to D antigens. This scenario is commonly observed in alloimmunized antenatal and volunteer immunized patients. Quantitation of anti-D in serum is important in the clinical setting to predict the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Quantitation of anti-D is also performed in quality control operations of organ procurement organizations and plasma fractionators. It is a common practice to report the strength of anti-D in serum as antibody titer values but quality control operations require a quantitative value. We have developed a screening assay using flow cytometry to quantitate anti-D in serum. Study Design/Method: We have developed a method to quantitate anti-D in serum using flow cytometry, by modifying the protocols of Christensson et al., and Hilden et al.. Red blood cells from Rh-positive blood samples were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.2 and the supernatant was discharged. A dilution buffer containing 2% human serum albumin (v/v) in phosphate buffered saline was prepared. Serum samples or WHO anti-D standards, suspended in dilution buffer were mixed with 10ll of washed red cells. The cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 378C. Following incubation, FITC-labeled anti-IgG diluted in buffer was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min at 228C. The samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry using gates for a typical red cell based on the forward and side-scatter signals. Green fluorescence was collected using a band-pass filter set for 515-548nm. Events were recorded at a frequency of 1000 cells. Results/Finding: Multiple dilutions of WHO anti-D reference standard were tested against Rh-positive red blood cells from five different donors. The reproducibility of the assay was determined by measuring the change in coefficient of variance due to dilution procedure, machine variation and sample storage condition. After optimizing these factors, a linear regression was calculated to establish the standard curve. The fluorescent intensity emitted by probes demonstrated a linear correlation with the concentration of Rh(D) antigens in reference standard. Serum from thirty Rh(D)-immunized volunteers were analyzed for concentration of anti-D and the results were benchmarked with antibody titer values. Conclusion: Based on our study, we conclude that the quantitation of Rh antigens by flow cytometry can be used as a reliable assay to measure the concentration of anti-D antibodies in serum. The method is reproducible and advantageous over reporting antibody titer values. The operations of this platform can be translated to a well-plate based high-throughput flow cytometry.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The use of emergency issued group A plasma and uncrossmatched group O whole blood (WB) in patients without a valid ABO group is becoming increasingly common in the USA. It is unclear if low titer products should be provided in this situation and indeed a universally agreed upon threshold that would qualify as \"low titer\" has not been established. This study was designed to determine the rate of high titer donors using a titer threshold of 50. Study Design/Methods: Three academic hospitals that routinely issue group A plasma units for emergency issue participated in this study. Before issuing this plasma to patients, a 1:50 dilution of the donor's plasma in saline was produced and added to group B reagent red blood cells (RBC). If any degree of macroscopic agglutination after immediate spin was observed, the unit was considered high titer and it would only have been issued to group A or O recipients. At these three centers no temperature, plasma volume or time enhancements were performed in the titer procedure, and anti-human globulin was not added. At one center samples were taken from the plasma of group O WB units and the same procedure was followed using A1 and B reagent RBCs; if at least one antibody demonstrated macroscopic agglutination after immediate spin, the WB unit was considered high titer and it was then centrifuged into an RBC unit for transfusion while the plasma and platelet components were discarded. Two centers provided plasma testing data for a 4-year and 5-year period, respectively. One center provided plasma and WB testing data for a 1-year period. Results/Findings: In total there were 7106 group A plasma units tested and 654 (9.2%) had a high titer anti-B. The range of high titer group A plasma units between these three centers was 7.4%-12.5%. Of the 1778 WB units tested, 388 (21.8%) units had a high titer; 221/1778 (12.4%) of the units had a high titer anti-A, 61/1778 (3.4%) had a high titer anti-B, and 106/1778 (6%) had high titers of both anti-A and anti-B. Background/Case Studies: Dithiothreiol (DTT) is a sulfhydryl reagent that denatures selective blood group antigens. Reagent red blood cells (RBCs) treated with 0.2M DTT is used as a tool in identifying antibodies to high frequency antigens. Recently, DTT has become widely used in destroying CD38 on reagent RBCs and render them free from plasma anti-CD38 drug interference. Procedures for the preparation of 0.2M DTT has been published advocating the use of buffered saline at different pH levels. In this study, an effect of pH on 0.2M DTT treatment time is investigated. Study Design/Methods: Non-buffered saline (NBS, Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc, Middletown, VA), used in the preparation of 0.2M DTT, was adjusted to pH7.16, pH 7.56, pH 7.96 using sodium phosphate dibasis (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). Reagent RBCs (Immucor, Norcross, GA)(n53) were treated with the 0.2M DTT solutions in parallel by mixing 1:4 ratio of packed RBCs to 0.2M DTT solution followed by incubation at 378C. For up to 45 minutes during treatment, the expression of k antigens was measured every 5 minutes by tube method using 2 different sources of anti-k. To assure uniformity, all reactions were graded by the same investigator. Each reaction grade (in each RBC and each antiserum) is converted into a semiquantitive score and an average score was calculated every 5 minutes for each pH level. The reduction in average scores between different pHs were also calculated at every 5 minutes to measure the impact of 0.2M DTT reagent pH on the rate of k antigen destruction. Results/Findings: The expression of k antigen, measured by agglutination grades with two different k antisera, is significantly weakened (by !11) after 15 minutes of DTT treatment at pH 7.96; 15 minutes at pH7.56 and 20 minutes at pH7.16. Complete loss of k expression was seen after 25 minutes of DTT treatment at pH7.96; 35 minutes at pH7.56 and 35 minutes at pH 7.16. The reactivity patterns of k antigen tested with 2 sources of anti-k correlate with each other. The reductions in average scores were seen between 15 to 30 minutes range of DTT treatment time when pH 7.16 was raised to pH7.56; 15 to 30minutes range when pH7.56 was raised to pH7.96; and 15 to 30 minutes range when pH7.16 was raised to pH7.96. Conclusion: The use of higher pH buffered saline may shorten the treatment time it takes to weaken or destroy k antigen. Based on the comparison of reaction scores between different pH levels, the pH levels did not have an impact on DTT treatment up to 15 minutes and/or beyond 35 minutes of incubation. The pH of the 0.2M DTT reagent relative to the treatment time is a factor to consider during the validation of DTT-treatment process and qualification of 0.2M DTT reagent in a laboratory.",

The aim of this study was to determine if frequencies of red cell antibodies differed between geographically distinct regions within the continental United States. Study Design/ Method: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate a cohort of prenatal patients (n 5 756,221) drawn between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014. These patients were divided into United States Census Bureau regional and divisional categories according to their place of residence. Prenatal blood work was collected which included an ABO, Rh(D) and a screen for unexpected alloantibodies. Samples found to be positive for red cell antibodies were sent to one of nine regional laboratories for identification. Results/ Finding: In total, 11,647 patients were found to possess clinically significant red cell antibodies for an overall incidence of 1.5 percent. The three most commonly encountered antibodies were anti-D (n 5 7639) 63.1%, anti-M (n 5 1288) 0.6%, and anti-E (n 5 1227) with a frequency of 10.1%. A total of 455 (3.9%) prenatal women were found to possess two or more antibodies. In general, the combination of anti-D and anti-C proved to be the most common, with 182 instances (40.0%) followed by anti-E and anti-c with 79 (17.4%), and anti-C, anti-e with 26 (5.7%). Of the multiple antibodies identified, 435 (95.6%) included at least one antibody from the Rh blood group. The South region had the largest number of antibodies identified with 7474 or 61.8% of the total. The West had 2111 (17.4%), the Midwest 1538 (12.7%) and the Northeast with 979 (8.1%). A contingency table, using the two-sided Fisher's exact test, was performed comparing the Northeast, South, Midwest and West regions. The p value of anti-D was calculated to determine nonrandom associations and values of 0.05 and below was deemed significant from a region-to-region perspective. With regard to anti-D, the Pacific division comprised of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, had p values below the 0.05 thresholds when compared against seven of the eight other divisions. The West South Central division (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) did not show statistically significant results when compared against the Pacific division (p 5 0.17). Conclusion: Depending upon the antibody, statistically significant variations between geographical regions and divisions within the United States were observed. This relationship between antibody and locality requires further investigation but may be attributed to the presence or absence of red cell antigens among different racial and ethical populations.",

            "text": "It was decided by leadership in our laboratory that it would be beneficial to observe how other methodologies perform in this regard. A side-by-side evaluation was performed between the IMMUCOR NEO and the ORTHO VISION (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester NY) to determine if there was a significant difference in the amount of repeat manual tube testing that needed to be performed. The evaluation looked at ABO/Rh and ABSC testing as those are the only tests that are currently automated in our laboratory. Study Design/Method: Thirty specimens that were processed on the IMMUCOR NEO and resulted in No Type Determined (NTD) for ABO/Rh testing were selected to be tested on the ORTHO VISION. Twenty-three specimens that were processed on the IMMUCOR NEO and produced positive results for ABSC testing were selected to be tested on the ORTHO VISION. All specimens were EDTA tubes and were collected within the previous 4 days. The timeframe between when the specimen was tested on the IMMUCOR NEO and the ORTHO VISION was 1 to 2 days. Results/Finding: Of the 30 NTD specimens from the IMMUCOR NEO, 8 resulted in valid ABO/Rh typings on the ORTHO VISION. Three results were flagged indicating possible extra reactivity. Upon performing a visual review of all 3 results, it was determined that there was no reactivity and a valid result was present. The other 19 samples required manual tube testing to interpret the ABO/Rh and were due to mixed field, weak isoagglutinins, unexplained extra reactivity, and hemolysis. Of the 23 ABSC specimens that were resulted out as positive on the IMMUCOR NEO, 11 specimens produced a negative result on the ORTHO VISION and were confirmed to be negative with manual tube testing using PEG as the enhancement media. One specimen was flagged for fibrin, but upon performing a visual review, was determined to be negative. Nine specimens that were positive on the IMMUCOR NEO were also positive on the ORTHO VISION. One specimen proved to be an anti-M that was seen in gel but not in tube and one specimen displayed unexplained reactivity in gel as it was negative in tube and all clinically significant antibodies were ruled out. All showed discrepant results with monoclonal anti-C reagents, with a similar pattern of reactivity: 3-41 with MS24 (n515), 1-31 S with MS23 (n59), no reaction with MS273, DGC02, P3x255 (n514). 14 samples tested with a polyclonal anti-C showed a 1-31 reactivity. 3 D1C1E1c1e1 cases tested with a polyclonal and monoclonal anti-e (MS16, MS21, MS62, MS63) showed no weakened reactivity. RHCE sequencing (genomic DNA or cDNA) showed a c.286G>A mutation in exon 2, predicted to encode the p.Gly96Ser substitution. For 2 apparent R 1 R 2 donors, a f-negative type allowed the prediction of a RHCE*Ce286A/RHCE*cE genotype. Altogether, our results are consistent with the presence of a very likely RHCE*Ce286A allele (C and e in cis) in all samples. 3 D1C1E1c1e1 individuals were reactive 11 S with the original source of anti-Rh55, slightly weaker when compared to RHCE*ce286A/RHCE*Ce RBC samples available from our cryobank (21). Conclusion: Our results confirm that the c.286G>A mutation alters the conformational properties of the RHCE protein, either on a ce or Ce background, and encodes the low-prevalence LOCR antigen (RH55). The LOCR reactivity appears to be rather similar when coded by RHCE*Ce286A or RHCE*ce286A alleles. This was quite an unexpected finding, since the p.Gly96Ser substitution is close to the critical amino-acid for C/c expression (p.Pro103Ser). None of our 15 cases made anti-C and/or anti-e but few were subject to a potential alloimmunization background. However, as RHCE*-ce286A was reported to code for a partial c (Rh:-26), we consider that RHCE*Ce286A likely encodes partial C and e, this being also supported by the predicted localization of the p.Gly96Ser change on the second extracellular loop of the RhCe protein. Background/Case Studies: Weak D genotyping is recommended for transfusion recipients, pregnant women, and newborns who had a RhD typing discrepancy, or a serological weak D phenotype, to determine if they carried the weak D genotypes 1, 2 or 3.

Results/Findings: The majority of the samples were from obstetrical patients (62%) followed by transfusion patients (28%); 10% had no clinical indication provided. 34 samples (68%) were found to be weak D type 1, 2, or 3 (24, 6, and 4 samples, respectively). 5 samples (10%) appear to be genetically RHD negative. Genetic sequencing was performed on 11 samples; 9 had RHD genetic variants that were not weak D types 1, 2, or 3 (Table) . All of these variant RHD samples also showed some variation in the RHCE gene. Two samples (4%) had wild type RHD alleles; further evaluation is ongoing.",

After D, c is the most immunogenic Rh antigen. The difference between c (307C) and C (307T) is caused by the SNP on position 307 on the RHCE gene. The RHD*07.02 allele (also known as RHD cat VII type 2) carries the SNP 307T>C on the RHD gene and additionally the SNP 329T>C. This RHD*07.02 allele has been described to partially express RHc on the D polypeptide (Faas, Transfusion, 2001) . Aims: Genotyping was performed to clarify the cause of the weak c expression. Serology of a patient sample (Male, 81938) indicated a partial c phenotype with a CDe. Study Design/Method: RhD and RhCE phenotyping was done by accredited routine protocols (monoclonal AB ID card: Diaclon Rh subgroups, seraclone anti-c). Genotyping was performed with a TaqMan Probe assay (RBC-FluoGene vERYfy, inno-train Diagnostik GmbH), SSO (RBC-Lifecodes, Gen-Probe Inc.), in-house SSP-PCR (HILA, Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen) and commercial SSP-PCR (RBC-Ready Gene CDE, inno-train Diagnostik GmbH). Sanger sequencing of the RHD gene was performed using an inhouse method (inno-train Diagnostik GmbH). Results/Finding: Discrepant genotyping results were generated by different test systems: the TaqMan Probe based assay showed in repetition a CCee genotype, while the SSO system RBC-Lifecodes predicted in repetition a Ccee phenotype. In SSP-PCR the sample showed a weak c band with the in-house method, while there was no band visible with the commercial test kit. The parallel analysis of the RHD gene with RBC-Ready Gene CDE test system revealed a variant D cat VII RHD allele. Sequencing of the DNA sample identified two SNPs on one of the RHD alleles (307T>C, 329T>C) confirming a RHD*07.02 and one RHD*01 allele. Hispanic female in preparation for surgery resulted in variable reactivity and weakly positive D reactions when using microtiter-well agglutination versus tube testing. Determination of whether the D antigen expression represented a weak D or a variant D could not be resolved by serologic testing alone. Here we report the characterization of a novel RHD gene mutation identified by RHD gene sequencing. Study Design/Method: Serologic typing was initially performed by microtiter-well agglutination by automated analyzer platforms Galileo NEO and Galileo Echo (Immucor, Norcross,GA) and by standard tube testing using the Immucor Series 4 and 5 anti-D reagents. Further immunohematologic evaluation was performed by standard tube testing (immediate spin -IS, and indirect antiglobulin -IAT) using OrthoBioclone, Immucor Gammaclone, Immucor Series 4 and Series 5, and ALBAclone anti-D reagents. DNA isolated from WBCs was used in manual RFLP and RHD BeadChip assay (Immucor, BioArray) and RHD sequencing. Results/Finding: RBC reactivity is summarized in the Table. DNA testing detected a hybrid rhesus box associated with the RHD gene deletion, indicating the patient was hemizygous for RHD. RFLP assay and RHD BeadChip did not identify any changes. RHD gene sequencing identified a new c.463A>G change in exon 3 encoding an amino acid change p.Met155Val. The predicted location of this change is within the fourth transmembrane segment of the RhD protein.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The Jo a antigen is one of three high incidence antigens in the Dombrock system. The prevalence of this antigen is 100% in most populations and greater than 99% in the black population. The Jo a antigen can be resistant or enhanced with enzyme treatment (ficin/papain) and typically variable with Dithiothreitol (DTT), W.A.R.M. TM (Immucor) and ZZAP treatment. Anti-Jo a is an IgG antibody that demonstrates at AHG phase. Hemolytic transfusion reactions to the Jo a antigen vary from none to moderate/severe. Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN) has not been observed with any antibody associated in the Dombrock system. There are two common phenotypes present in the black population:Hy negative/ Jo a negative and Hy weakly expressed/Jo a negative. Study Design/Methods: An antibody identification and red blood cell (RBC) units were requested for an O positive, 57 year old, African-American female with a history of sickle cell disease and no history of pregnancy. The patient was not recently transfused, however, had a history of chronic transfusions. Last reported transfusion was three years prior to the current specimen. There were no known RBC antibodies at the time of the request. Facility reports that the patient's hemoglobin(g/dL)/hematocrit(%) (Hgb/Hct) is 6.4/ 18.8 and does not appear to be in sickle cell crisis. A request for phenotypically matched units, as per hospital policy, for C, E, K and S was received by our Immunohematology Reference Laboratory (IRL). Results/Findings: Anti-Jo a was detected in patient plasma reacting with LISS and PeG (tube method) and manual Gel-IAT. The antibody was resistant when tested with DTT treated red cells. In-house frozen reagent RBCs negative for the Jo a antigen (positive for Hy) were used to serologically prove the presence of the antibody to this high incidence antigen. An allogenic PeG adsorption was performed to rule out other common clinically significant antibodies. Anti-Kp a was identified using this adsorbed plasma. Further testing with molecular genotyping (Grifols IdCore XT ) confirmed the patient's genotyping as antigen negative for the Jo a , Kp a and positive for Hy. Conclusion: Molecular testing is frequently performed on patients and retained donor samples from our local community donor pool throughout Florida, Georgia and Alabama. Staff is able to search our database for any combination of antigen negative phenotypes using the internal 510(k) Blood Establishment Computer Software (BECS) Integrated Blood Bank Information System (IBBIS). This enabled us to locate one refrigerated and three cryogenically preserved Jo a negative RBC units. We found 251 eligible blood donors that could be recruited via an automatically generated call list. The request for RBCs was cancelled. Patient's clinical symptoms improved without transfusion and repeat Hgb/Hct increased to 7.1/21. The patient's sibling is historically negative for the Jo a antigen and should future transfusions be required, it was recommended that a directed donation be made on the patient's behalf. In order to continue having blood components available to meet all our patient's needs, IRL staff is consistently screening and searching our inventory for blood components that are negative for rare antigens to retain for patients needing antigen negative units in a timely fashion. RBCs of two females whose samples were referred for RHD genotyping with previously reported alleles for which serologic reactivity had never been investigated. Study Design/Method: Serologic testing was performed by automated analyzer, Galileo Echo and NEO (Immucor, Norcross, GA), and by standard tube testing with licensed anti-D reagents and the ALBAclone advanced partial RhD typing kit. Genomic DNA isolated from WBCs was used for Immucor RHD BeadChip assay, PCR-RFLP, and RHD sequencing. Results/Finding: Patient 1 was a 29 yo female, C2E2c1e1, whose RBCs reacted 11 by ECHO and 31 by NEO with anti-D4, and '?' with anti-D5. Testing with D4 and D5 by tube gave 21 and 11 w on initial spin (IS) respectively and 41 by indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). RBCs were non-reactive at IS with Ortho BioClone and BioRad Seraclone, and 1 w with Immucor Gammaclone anti-D, and all were 21 at IAT. RBCs did not react with two (LHM 174/102 & 57/17) of 12 anti-D in the Alba partial D kit. This pattern did not match any partial D identified by these clones. RHD BeadChip detected an inactive RHD pseudogene in trans to RHD. Gene sequencing confirmed the presence of the pseudogene, but RHD had a c.780C>A change encoding p.His260Gln. Patient 2 was a 20 yo pregnant female, C2E2c1e1, whose RBC were 1 w at IS and 31 at IAT with Immucor Series 4 and 5 and Gammaclone, and moderately reactive, 21 IS and 41 IAT, with ALBA alpha, ALBA blend and delta anti-D. RBCs did not react with two (LHM 174/102 & 170/45) anti-D in the partial D kit with no known partial D pattern. DNA testing predicted she was RHD hemizygous and RHD BeadChip detected markers for RHD*DAR but exon 2 gave low signal (LS). Sequencing found a hybrid DAR with CE-specific nucleotides in exon 2 from c.150 to c.203 encoding amino acid changes p.Ile60Leu and Ser68Asn. Conclusion: We found two previously reported rare alleles: RHD with a c.780C>A (p.His260Gln), previously found in France (LeFloch et al. GenBank KU363612), and RHD*DAR with part of exon 2 replaced by RHCE, reported in sub-Sahara Africa (Granier et al. Transfusion 53:3009) designated RHD*DAR(CE2:V505V-S68N) with an allele frequency of 0.002 to 0.016. Blood samples were not available to test for alterations in D expression for either allele. We provide serologic evidence that these alleles, found in two females evaluated by RHD genotyping, inform transfusion and Rh immune globulin prophylaxis, as they encode partial D phenotypes with novel epitope expression patterns, meaning these patients are at risk of forming allo anti-D. Background/Case Studies: Hu5F9-G4 is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody recognizing CD47 that is in clinical trials to treat hematologic or solid malignancies. CD47 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds to signalregulatory protein a (SIRPa) on macrophages and functions to regulate phagocytosis. Blocking CD47 is thought to enhance phagocytosis and promote anti-tumor responses. CD47 is also highly expressed on RBCs, and the purpose of this study was to evaluate anti-CD47 drug interference in blood bank testing. Study Design/Method: Serologic testing was performed by standard methods. Serial samples (n57) from 2 patients were tested over the course of 1 month treatment. Plasma was tested at immediate spin (IS) and by IAT with R2R2, rr, D--, Rh mod and Rh null RBCs, as CD47 expression levels vary depending on Rh phenotype. DTT and enzyme treated RBCs were also tested. Both Immucor Gamma-clone anti-IgG (does not detect IgG4) and Ortho BioClone anti-IgG (total IgG) were used. For titration plasma was diluted in PBS. Allo-adsorptions were performed with papain treated rr RBCs and eluates were made using Gamma ELU-KIT II. Results/Finding: Anti-CD47 was observed in plasma as soon as 1 hour post infusion. Plasma reacted 31 to 41 at IS and 41 with all panel cells in PEG IAT using Ortho anti-IgG. D--, Rh mod and Rh null RBCs were nonreactive at IS and weaker (31 and 21) in PEG IAT with Ortho reagent. Reactivity with all panel cells by Ortho IgG gel card was 31. In contrast, IAT reactivity using Gamma-clone anti-IgG was only 1 w to 11, and this reactivity was confirmed to be carry-over agglutination. D--, Rh mod and Rh null were non-reactive in PEG IAT using Gamma-clone anti-IgG . The anti-CD47 titer was 1 at IS and PEG IAT with Gamma-clone anti-IgG, but was ! 256 with Ortho anti-IgG. Plasma reacted with DTT, trypsin, papain, a-chymotrypsin or W.A.R.M. treated RBCs. Somewhat unexpected, autocontrols were negative and DATs were non-reactive or microscopic only. Acid eluates (n54) were 31 reactive with Ortho, and non-reactive with Gamma-clone anti-IgG. Plasma reactivity was removed after 4X allo-adsorption with papain treated rr cells, but in some samples low level (micro-11) reactivity remained. PEG adsorption was invalid due to precipitation/complexing of antibody. Robust plasma reactivity interferring in ABO reverse typing was observed, and weak spontaneous agglutination of the RBCs in the ABO forward and Rh typing. Conclusion: Hu5F9-G4 anti-CD47 therapy interferes with routine pretransfusion testing, not only antibody screening and crossmatch, but ABO and Rh typing. High levels of CD47 expression on RBCs results in plasma agglutination at IS, mimicking reactivity observed with IgM antibodies although Hu5F9-G4 is IgG4. Reactivity was observed in all phases and with all test methods. CD47 is not cleaved from RBCs by DTT, trypsin, papain/ ficin, DTT with ficin (W.A.R.M.) or a-chymotrypsin, and treatment of RBCs with these does not mitigate interference. Numerous adsorptions with papain treated rr RBCs were required to remove anti-CD47 reactivity from plasma. Use of Immucor Gamma-clone anti-IgG, which does not detect IgG4, can mitigate interference in IAT although carryover reactivity may be observed. Due to blocking by anti-CD47 on the patient RBCs, DAT and autocontrols were weak or non-reactive; however eluates prepared from the DAT1 RBCs were strong and pan-reactive using Ortho Anti-IgG. Background/Case Studies: A Caucasian woman with history of a Caesarean section and a RBC TX in 1985. In August 2016, she was admitted to hospital for trauma surgery, ab screening was negative and two units were transfused without transfusion reactions. Five days later she was referred to a tertiary care trauma center due to a severe postop infection and need for a reoperation. Ab screening was now positive, with an antibody reacting with all panel cells detected. Because of the urgent need for RBC TX, two weakly cross-match positive Rh1K matched units were transfused with a warning of possible alloantibodies. The patient got acute hemolysis. Study Design/Method: A Gel technique was used in the Hospital Transfusion Laboratory. In addition, various antibody identification panels and special serological and genotyping methods were used in the Reference Laboratory. KEL sequencing was done by the International Immunohematology Center. Results/Finding: The Hospital Transfusion Laboratory results were O RhD neg, DAT neg, and the ab identification was 21 with untreated and 31 with enzyme-treated cells, with weakly positive autocontrols. A sample was submitted to the reference laboratory for additional investigation. DAT was weakly positive, while ab identification results were similar to the hospital results. Different pheno-and genotyping methods were used in addition to several identification panels to exclude rare blood groups. After Pk, Vel neg, Jk:-3 etc. had been excluded, k-phenotyping revealed a K 0 -phenotype. A total of 38 silencing mutations are known for the KEL gene and the genotyping kits used did not recognize these. The Anti-Ku antibody reacts with all cells apart from the K 0 -phenotype. The presence of DTT-sensitive anti-Ku was confirmed with DTT-treated panel cells. Anti-Ku may cause immediate and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. Samples were taken from the patient's two siblings and daughter. KEL sequencing revealed KEL*02N.19 with c.2023T encoding p.675Ter (reported in an individual from Austria in 2007). There are two known K 0 -patients in our country, both homozygous for c.2023T. The daughter was a c.2023T heterozygote, while the siblings did not have this variant. A new operation is necessary but no K 0 -donors are available in our country. With the help of the ISBT Rare Donor Working Party, a K 0 O RhD neg donor was found in Japan and one unit was delivered to us for use in the next operation. Conclusion: An alloantibody should always be suspected when autocontrol is weaker than panel cell reactions, even if the direct Coombs is positive. A combined serological and genotyping approach offers the best solution for problematic antibody cases. Compatible blood is not always available in rare blood group cases, but international co-operation may be of help in finding a suitable donor.",

            "text": "Transfusion Strategy for the Serologic Weak D Phenotype in Tunisia Based on RHD alleles and RH haplotypes Mouna Ouchari* 1 , Kshitij Srivastava 2 , Houda Romdhane 3 , Saloua Jemni Yacoub 4 and Willy Albert Flegel 1 . 1 NIH, 2 DTM/CC/NIH, 3 Regional Blood Transfusion Center Sousse, 4 Regional Blood Transfusion Center Sousse, Tunisia Background/Case Studies: D antigen variants have been studied molecularly in many Arab populations, including Gaza, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, 159A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 since 2009. The Tunisian population has the largest known prevalence of weak D type 4.0 alleles, occurring in 1 of 105 RH haplotypes, compared to 1 in 6,060 or less in Europe. A systematic study was missing for samples with the serologic weak D phenotype routinely found in blood donor and patient testing in Tunisia. The study was designed to obtain data on weak D type 4.0 in a population known to harbor the greatest prevalence of such allele worldwide. Study Design/Methods: A total of 13,431 random blood donors were serologically screened for the D antigen using 3 routine techniques. Samples with weak reactivity were tested with a panel of 6 monoclonal anti-D (Partial RhD-Typing Set) to identify partial D phenotypes. The RHD gene was sequenced in all samples with serologic weak D phenotype. The RHCE gene was also tested molecularly by either direct sequencing or using the RHCE BeadChip kit to ascertain the RHCE allele linked to the RHD allele. Results/Findings: A total of 67 discrepant samples (0.5%) were observed and expressed the serologic weak D phenotype. Among them, 60 carried an allele of the weak D type 4 cluster (89.6%), of which 53 samples (88.3%) showed the weak D type 4.0 allele. Only 1 sample each was found for the weak D types 1, 3 and 100 and the DVII, while 3 samples showed the consensus RHD sequence. No mutation in any of the 10 RHD exons was detected in another 3 samples. The molecular analysis of the RHCE gene showed that 59 out of 67 samples with serologic weak D phenotype (88.06%) had a variant RHCE allele and the most common associations were: weak D type 4.0 linked to RHCE*ceVS.04.01; weak D type 4.2.2 with ceAR; and weak D type 4.1 to RHCE*ceVS.02, while the other RHD alleles were linked to one of the common RHCE alleles. Conclusion: Almost 90% of the weak D phenotypes in Tunisia were caused by alleles of the weak D type 4 cluster, of which 88% represented the weak D type 4.0 allele. Based on established RH haplotypes for variant RHD and RHCE alleles and the lack of adverse clinical reports in Tunisia, we recommend D positive transfusions for patients and no RhIG administration for pregnant women with weak D type 4.0 in Tunisia. We propose this strategy as a pragmatic clinical decision, even if eventually a rare allo-anti-D immunization would occur in Tunisia associated with weak D type 4.0 phenotype. There is a possibility that the RHCE*ceVS.04.01 allele, typically associated in Tunisian individuals, may protect from allo-anti-D immunizaton and other RHCE alleles, such as RHCE*ce more often associated in individuals of other ethnic groups, may not. However, we conclude that this conjecture has not much evidence in support at this time and would need corroboration by experimental and clinical data, before used to guide clinical recommendations.",

Westhoff 2 . 1 Duke University Hospital, 2 Immunohematology and Genomics Laboratory, New York Blood Center, 3 ARC PennJersey, 4 American Red Cross, Immunohematology Reference Laboratory, Biomedical Services Background/Case Studies: Plasma from a transfused, A1, 2 year old white female, post liver transplant with RBC aplasia, reacted at RT and in PEG IAT with all RBC samples tested except her own. Study Design/Method: Standard hemagglutination methods were used for antibody ID and antigen typing. Acid eluates were prepared using Gamma ELU-KIT II (Immucor). Genomic DNA was isolated from WBCs and used for HEA PreciseType array and KEL and SC gene sequencing. Samples from the proband and her mother were tested, as applicable. Results/Finding: The patient's DAT was negative. Her plasma reacted with 0.2M DTT-treated and papain-treated RBCs, all available RBC samples lacking high-prevalence antigens, and with phenotypically similar RBC samples [C2, K2, Fy(a2),S2]. Reactivity was detected to a titer of 64; it was not removed by prewarm technique or by 4x PEG alloadsorption. The adsorbed plasma reacted with 0.2M DTT-treated RBCs. Extensive RBC phenotype results were unremarkable except for the following: K2, k2, Js(b2), Kp(a2b2) and Sc:21,23. Her plasma reacted with K o , McLeod, Sc:21,22 RBC samples and DTT-treated Sc:21 RBCs at RT and PEG IAT but her diluted plasma and pretransfusion eluate showed relative Kp b specificity. The patient was transfused 4 aliquots of crossmatch incompatible Kp(b2), S2 RBCs. Her post-transfusion DAT was 21 with anti-IgG, 11 with anti-C3d. The eluate reacted with all RBC samples except 1 Kp(b2) sample. She tolerated additional aliquots from 4 phenotypically similar RBCs untested for high-prevalence Kell or Scianna antigens. The HEA Precise-Type predicted K2, k1, Kp(a2b1), Js(a2b1) and Sc:1,22, discordant with her RBC phenotype. KEL gene sequencing identified a homozygous change, c.1481A>T (p.Glu494Val) (KEL*02.10) encoding the low prevalence antigen, Ul a , but no changes associated with lack of Kell system antigens; however, her RBCs typed Ul(a2). SC sequencing found heterozygosity for a 5'-2g>a change (rs12124733, 24 to 30% prevalence) and conventional SC*01, predicting Sc:1,22,3. KEL and SC results on the mother were KEL*02/KEL*02.10, heterozygous for the SC change 5'-2g>a, and her RBCs typed K2k1 Kp(a2b1), Sc31, Ula1, consistent with DNA predictions. Plasma collected 7 months later was nonreactive at RT and in PEG IAT. Her RBCs were DAT2 and now typed k1, Kp(a2b1), Ul(a1) Sc11 and Sc31,concordant with predicted Kell and Sc phenotypes. Conclusion: We report an example of Kell and Scianna antigen suppression or blocking in the presence of autoantibody or an alloantibody in the KEL system. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Ul a KEL*02.10 homozygote. The RBCs may lack a high-prevalence antigen antithetical to Ul a . Without DNA testing and gene sequencing, the patient would be presumed to have Kell null and Sc null phenotypes, a search for K o , and/or Sc:21,23 RBC units would be performed and we would not have been prompted to re-type her RBCs when the DAT was negative. Background/Case Studies: Anti-Jka is a common antibody identified in the blood bank and providing phenotypically characterized red cells lacking this antigen is important in avoiding an acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. In nearly all cases, this antibody is identified in the context of a phenotypically homozygous Jkb patient, Jk(a-b1). Other scenarios are quite rare. We present two cases of anti-Jka in which this phenotype was not observed. Study Design/Method: Patient A is a 55-year-old multiparous female with no known transfusion history. Her blood typed as O positive with a positive antibody screen, negative DAT, and a clearly identified anti-Jka in plasma. The patient phenotyped as Jk(a-b-). Genotyping revealed the presence of the JK*B allele, but not the JK*A allele. Complete sequencing of the JK gene showed an intron 5 polymorphism in homozygosity. Specifically, the patient showed a JK*B(IVS5-1A)genotype, associated with a Jkb null phenotype. Anti Jk3 was not identified. The conclusion was an allo-anti-Jka in a Jk null patient. The patient did not receive any transfusions.",

            "text": "Patient B is a multiply transfused 64 old female. Her blood typed as A positive with a positive DAT and antibody screen. Both the plasma and eluate revealed an anti-Jka. Despite the recent transfusion, the patient phenotyped as Jk(a1) 41 and Jk(b1) 21. Genotyping showed the presence of both JK*A and JK*Balleles. Whole gene sequencing was not performed. There was no hematologic or biochemical evidence of hemolysis. The patient was considered to have an auto-anti-Jka and Jka negative cells used for transfusion. Results/Findings: Patients A and B both developed anti-Jka while having uncommon phenotypes/genotypes. Conclusion: It is common for Jk null patients to develop anti-Jk3. However, we speculate that expression of the Kidd glycoprotein with the Jkb epitope was below the threshold of serological detection, but enough to prevent the formation of anti-Jk3 or anti-Jkb. Auto-anti-Jka is usually reported in the context of an active hemolytic process, but Patient B illustrates an auto-anti-Jka without hemolysis which is more commonly observed with autoantibodies exhibiting specificity for Rh epitopes. These rare cases of anti-Jka require phenotypic and genetic analysis for the Jkb epitope and JK*B allele respectively, and in more complex cases whole gene sequencing. Background/Case Studies: Donor genotyping for red blood cell antigens has become common practice in many blood bank laboratories. Package inserts for commercial assays indicate false negative results may be generated when unexpected rare mutations affect primer or probe binding and cause allele dropout or failed amplification. These outcomes may go unrecognized unless serological results are available for comparison. Study Design/Method: A routine blood donor, self-identified as African American, was selected for red blood cell genotyping. DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed using two commercial platforms 160A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 (PreciseType, BioArray, Warren NJ; IDCore XT , Grifols, Emeryville, CA). Genotype results were compared to historical serological results. Discrepancies were resolved by Sanger sequencing (Grifols IH, San Marcos, TX). Results/Finding: Genotyping results showed variants in both the Duffy (FY) and Kell (KEL) blood group systems. The donor's genotype was concordant on both platforms, FY*A/FY*B_GATA, KP*A/KP*A, for a predicted phenotype: Fy(a1b-); Kp(a1b-). When genotype results were compared to historical serology, it was noted that the donor previously typed Fy(a-) on 3 separate donations. No previous Kpa or Kpb serotyping was available. Sequencing of FY exon 2 revealed a 287G>A mutation, FY01*N.04, known to silence Fya. Sequencing of KEL exons 1-19 exposed a silent polymorphism in exon 8, 846G>C. This polymorphism causes a dropout artifact yielding a false negative Kpb interpretation. Conclusion: The discrepant FY*A result, as well as the unlikely Kp(b-) type prompted the request for sequencing. The rare FY01*N.04 mutation has been reported in people of Caucasian descent. This is the first example of this FY mutation identified in this regional population. The Kpb antigen is present in nearly 100% of all populations. However, Kp(b-) is most frequently seen in people of Caucasian descent. To date, 64 self-identified African American donors have been genotyped as KP*A/KP*B at this blood center. Given the diversity of regional heterogeneity, it is feasible to identify a Kp(b-) donor, self-reporting as African American. Red blood cell genotyping offers an abundance of information, but cannot replace serology as the sole means of red cell antigen characterization. Donor ethnicity continues to play a key role in selection for genotyping and the search for rare and unusual red cell types. In this case, a donor selected for genotyping based on ethnicity was initially thought to have 2 genetic variants not previously reported in those of African descent. Only 1 was proven to be present. This case acts as a reminder that genotype limitations must be considered even when using licensed methodologies. This case report presents two group O pediatric patients who had been on enteral feeds and had absent/weak anti-B that became strong over time in patient 1. Study Design/Methods: Patient 1 was a 7 year-old male born prematurely with short gut syndrome who underwent a small bowel and liver transplant at 3 years of age. Anti-B changed from undetectable/weak to strong at the age of 7 years. Patient 2 was a 17 month-old female with a metabolic urea cycle disorder who underwent a liver transplant. Anti-B was 0/11. Both patients were on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since birth and had strong anti-A and normal immunoglobulin testing. ABO typing with enhancing techniques is presented in Table 1 . Results/Findings: Both patients typed as group O on forward typing. Anti-A was strong in both patients. Anti-B varied in strength in patient 1 with 0-11 reactions up to 7 years of age. Thereafter, ABO typing showed mainly strong anti-B. Patient 2 had 0/11 anti-B. Conclusion: Intestinal bacteria stimulates production of anti-A and -B. Unexpected changes in anti-B that caused ABO discrepancies are reported here for 2 children on long-term TPN. Patient 1 had absent/weak anti-B since birth up to 7 years of age, then developed strong anti-B with no change in feeding regiment and medications. Patient 2 had consistently strong anti-A and absent/weak anti-B. These findings support the notion that normal colonization of the gut is important in the development of anti-A and -B and suggests that microflora of the gut in patients on prolonged TPN is different leading to the delayed formation of these antibodies compared to individuals on normal enteral diet. Difference in strength of anti-A and-B could be due to stronger A than B antigen expression on gut bacteria. Results/Finding: A daratumumab protocol was established that incorporated use of the cord panel. Multiple myeloma patients selected as candidates for daratumumab treatment were baseline tested for blood type and antibody screen, DAT and genotype. After daratumumab infusion, a two unit crossmatch was order as a precaution in the event the patient developed a reaction to the medication.",

The utility of PEG is to enhance the sensitivity of detecting clinically significant antibodies by the indirect antiglobulin procedure.

The package insert for Gamma PeG TM (Immucor Inc., Norcross, GA), states that negative reactions may be examined with an optical aid. Based on these directions, our institutional policy is to confirm all negative reactions using the microscope.

Hereditary absence of AnWj has only been described once (in a single family). However, red cell expression of AnWj may be markedly decreased to near undetectable levels in blood donors of the In(Lu) (or \"Dominant Lutheran Inhibitor\") phenotype. Similarly, anti-AnWj antibody formation is rare, with only 10 cases reported in the literature. The antibody developed in the context of hereditary absence of AnWj (i.e., a true alloantibody) in only one of the cases. In the other nine cases, the antibody occurred in the context of autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disease, where, in this context, it is believed to have developed secondary to transient AnWj antigen suppression. Most of the reported cases lacked clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. However, in the most recently reported case, involving a 56-yearold woman with aplastic anemia, the antibody was associated with acute hemolytic reactions after RBC transfusions, necessitating transfusion support with AnWj-negative and In(Lu) RBCs. The case was also unique in that the anti-AnWj resulted in a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) that was positive for complement only, rather than IgG like all previous cases in which the DAT was performed and was positive. Study Design/Method: A 59-year-old woman with severe aplastic anemia experienced acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTR) with development of a panagglutinin on indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) screens. Prior to identifying the specificity of the panreactive antibody, the patient received 10 RBC transfusions and showed signs of hemolysis with six of them. The first three transfusions were prior to her positive IAT and were electronically crossmatched. The next seven transfusions were incompatible by antihuman globulin (AHG) phase crossmatch, but were extended phenomatched for clinically significant antigens. The patient's AHTR signs and symptoms included fever, rigors, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, flank pain and \"impending doom\" anxiety; while her laboratory findings included hemoglobin decreasing below pre-transfusion levels, and increased total bilirubin and LDH. The DAT, while initially negative during the immediate posttransfusion workup of the transfusion reactions, eventually became positive for IgG only (1-21), and negative with anti-C3b, C3d reagent. The antibody showed a peak gel-IgG IAT titer of 32. Results/Finding: The antibody was identified as having AnWj specificity. The patient's pre-transfusion sample showed weak AnWj expression (w1), altogether suggesting an auto-anti-AnWj. Monocyte monolayer assay testing using the patient's plasma and RBCs from the AHTR-implicated units yielded monocyte indices ranging from 33 to 83%, consistent with the clinical hemolysis observed. Given the patient's group O, Rh D negative blood type and continuing transfusion dependence, in order to avoid further AHTRs, international collaboration was necessary in order to procure and provision group O, Rh D negative RBCs that were also serologically negative for AnWj. The patient was successfully transfused three such units without further incident. Conclusion: This is the second documented case of anti-AnWj in a patient with aplastic anemia and, overall, the third anti-AnWj case associated with AHTR. This case also underscores the importance of international collaboration.",

Conclusion: FNHTR is described as the most common adverse event related to transfusion, but our data showed a higher incidence of allergic reactions. FNHTR occurred 3 times less than allergic reactions. This might be explained by universal leukoreduction and universal prophylaxis adopted at our institution. Further studies are necessary to evaluated the benefit of this approach. that cannot be associated with a specific RBC unit or were deemed unrelated to transfusion, 358 RBC transfusion AEs were analyzed. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to compare the AE incidences among transfusion groups. Results/Finding: Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses showed that irradiated RBCs were associated with a significantly increased incidence of transfusion-related AEs (p <0.05). There was a significant difference in febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) (0.27% vs 0.11%, p <0.001) or AEs with a non-allergic type inflammation etiology (0.30% vs 0.14%, p <0.001) including transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated dyspnea, but not transfusion-associated circulatory overload, infections or hemolytic transfusion reactions, between irradiated RBCs and non-irradiated RBCs. In contrast, the incidences of allergic AEs (0.028% vs 0.024%, p 5 0.614) were similar between these two groups. The incidences of inflammation AEs after transfusion of irradiated RBCs that were stored for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks were 0.25%, 0.32%, 0.39% and 0.41%, respectively (p 5 0.084, logistic regression) but there was a significant difference in the incidence of inflammation AEs caused by irradiated RBCs stored for a week (0.25%) and longer than a week (0.35%) (p < 0.05).",

While it is likely the patient population is a factor in AE caused by irradiated RBCs, it is also possible that RBC radiation damage, as shown in previous studies, contributed to this increased AE incidence. A list of patients with one of these icd10 codes was generated. The EMR was searched to find the clinical scenario in which TRALI was mentioned. These patients' records were then searched within our laboratory information system (CoPath), to determine if they had a transfusion reaction reported to our transfusion medicine service. Results/Finding: The search of our electronic medical record found 11 patients from 2011-2016, who had TRALI mentioned in their chart as a diagnosis or possible/likely diagnosis. One patient was excluded from our study because TRALI was mentioned as a past medical history from an outside hospital. Only the patients who had TRALI listed as a diagnosis or possible diagnosis were included in this study. These 10 patients had clinical scenarios in which a transfusion of a blood product occurred which was followed by various forms of respiratory distress. The clinical teams caring for these patients were either giving a diagnosis of TRALI or considering TRALI as a possible diagnosis. Of these 10 cases, only 2 of them were reported to our transfusion medicine service as transfusion reactions. Of the reported cases, one was determined to be TRALI and the other one was consistent with TACO. Eight out of those 10 cases were never reported. Background/Case Studies: Despite diligent efforts to transfuse the safest product available to patients, undetected alloantibodies may cause delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR). This transfusion reaction is seen in as many as 1 out of 100 transfused products. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) may be employed to mitigate ongoing immune mediated hemolysis, but few reports in the literature describe TPE for clinical management after profound hemolysis. Study Design/Method: Case review of a patient was performed after diagnosis and treatment of severe DHTR. Results/Finding: A man with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and \"hematuria\". He had a known history of anti-D and anti-C, and was transfused two units of crossmatch compatible RBCs seven days prior during a previous admission. Readmission hemoglobin (Hb) was 8.7 g/dL but declined to 7.3 g/dL the next day. An antibody screen was consistent with anti-D, anti-C, and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was negative. He received three units of crossmatch compatible RBCs over days 2 and 3 with poor responses. On day 4, routine labs could not be reported due to marked hemolysis, he had \"worsening hematuria\", creatinine rose from 1.0 mg/dL to 1.8 mg/dL (reference 0.8-1.3 mg/dL), and lactate dehydrogenase was above reportable linearity, >2500 u/L (reference 122-222 u/L). Testing revealed additional anti-E, anti-Jkb, DAT C31, plasma free Hb 64.4 mg/dL (reference 1-15.2 mg/dL), and hemoglobinuria. Four of five transfused RBC units were Jk(b1), one of which was also E1. One volume TPE was performed to remove free Hb on days 5, 6, and 7 using fresh frozen plasma as replacement fluid for haptoglobin supplementation. Creatinine peaked at 3.7 mg/dL on day 13, decreased to 2.3 mg/dL before discharge on day Results/Findings: Twenty three cases were identified, of which 20 had medical records available for analysis. Ten (50%) patients were male, the mean age was 50.4 years (range 24-76 years), 15 (75%) had an underlying hematologic malignancy or bone marrow disorder, and 3 (15%) had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The implicated units included 14 (70%) red blood cells and 6 (30%) platelets; 17 (85%) patients received a single unit, and 3 (15%) received two or more within the previous 6 hours; the mean volume transfused was 153.3 mL (range 20-280 ml). The mean time to onset of chest pain was 92.15 minutes (SD 85 minutes), with 90% of patients presenting within 2.5 hours and 100% within 6 hours of starting the transfusion. Chest pain was present as the only symptom in 35% of the cases, and for the other cases the accompanying symptoms included dyspnea (30%), fever (25%), back pain (20%), and hypo-and hypertension (10%). A post-transfusion chest X-ray was performed in 65% of cases, and all showed no evidence of pulmonary edema to suggest possible volume overload/transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). Electrocardiogram was performed in 70% of cases and showed no findings to suggest acute ischemia. Three (15%) patients had a minimal increase in their troponin levels, although 1 had a history of chronically elevated troponin due to stress cardiomyopathy. Fourteen (70%) patients received some form of treatment, including increased oxygen supplementation, metoprolol, acetaminophen, morphine, and oral calcium carbonate; the pain resolved after more than 10 minutes in the majority of patients (90%). No cases resulted in new admission to the ICU or procedure cancelation. Conclusion: Chest pain associated with transfusion was infrequent, but several such cases were identified during the review period. This symptom is not a diagnostic criterion for any of the other Hemovigilance categories and merits further characterization to determine whether blood product transfusion could be the cause of the chest pain. Larger observational studies to power clinical characterization could help to further inform hypotheses regarding a transfusion-related mechanism, which could be interrogated by translational research studies. Background/Case Studies: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in children is most commonly seen in the form of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, TMA may be seen in the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN). The action of bacterial neuraminidase of SPN results in exposure of the normally \"hidden\" Thomsen-Freidenreich antigen (T-antigen) found on erythrocytes and other tissues. Ultimately, this may lead to SPN induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (pHUS) with subsequent hemolysis and end organ damage by naturally occurring anti-T antibodies against the exposed T antigen. Specific lectins or anti-sera can confirm exposure of the T antigens in pHUS. Alternatively, pHUS can be identified by minor crossmatch incompatibility resulting from agglutination of exposed T antigens on recipient's erythrocytes to anti-T antibodies in the plasma portion of blood products. We present a case of suspected pHUS that resulted in a compatible minor crossmatch leading to concern and eventually diagnosis of atypical HUS (aHUS). Study Design/Method: A 6 months old boy presented with respiratory failure. He was found to have blood cultures positive for SPN as well as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. He was Shiga toxin negative and had normal levels of ADAMTS 13. Based on the findings, the clinical team was concerned for pHUS. Therefore, he received washed erythrocytes. For his thrombocytopenia, our institution does not routinely provide washed platelets due to decrease quality of the platelet product. As a result, a minor crossmatching was suggested and performed to determine if T activation was present. Results/Finding: Minor crossmatch was performed with patient's erythrocytes and plasma of ABO-identical platelets to be transfused. No agglutination was seen at immediate spin, 37 degree, or anti-human globulin phase. Check cells were found to be 21. These findings were conveyed to the clinical team and platelets were issued without washing. Due to the lack of identification of T activation by minor crossmatching and poor clinical response despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, additional studies were performed by the primary team for complement mutations and found to be consistent with aHUS. The patient was then treated with Eculizumab with clinical and laboratory improvement.",

Study Design/Methods: Type & screen (TS, gel) and anti-A titers (tube) were performed using routine methods. A chart review was performed for pertinent medical and laboratory findings. Results/Findings: The patient was a 63-year-old O1 man with cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency who presented for OLT (donor O1). During OLT, the patient endured substantial bleeding from retroperitoneal collateral vessels complicated by post-transplant coagulopathy. He required rapid high volume RBC and plasma support, which strained hospital inventories. After receiving 46 units of O1 RBCs and 26 units of O1 plasma with ongoing severe hemorrhage, he was switched to group A products. Ten units of A1 plasma were transfused to wash out anti-A antibody prior to transfusion of A1 RBCs. Due to difficulty controlling the bleeding, biliary reconstruction and fascial closure were delayed for 7 hours post-transplant. The patient's total estimated blood loss was >20L. He received a total of 71 units of RBCs (including 23 A1), 63 units of plasma (including 37 A1), 6 units of cryoprecipitate, and 9 units of platelets. Towards the end of the second procedure, the patient's hemorrhage was stabilized and the final two RBC units he received were O1. On postoperative day (POD) 1, a TS showed predominantly A1 RBCs with trace O1 RBCs, as well as very low anti-A IgM and IgG titers (Table 1) . He received two additional O1 RBC units (1 each on POD 4 and POD 12) with increasing O1 RBCs on TS and rising anti-A titers. His blood type was unequivocally O1 by POD 13.

The TSS is fully effective in protecting against incidents, and specifically offers mechanisms to detect near misses (NM) by using procedural and physical barriers, assuring that the pretransfusional sample extraction (PSE) and the blood components administration (BCA) only take place at bed side, using a location control and interacting with the clinical and transfusion information systems (TIS). The TSS allows to analyze the transfusional activity information in real time to project organizational changes in both transfusion services and hospital units, and to create a new classification of NM.

To safeguard safety, efficacy and regulatory compliance, transfusion services actively benchmark transfusionrelated errors (TREs) as they occur from \"vein-to-vein\", i.e. from collection of pre-transfusion sample to final infusion of product -with the goal of ensuring that the right product/dose goes to the right patient at the right time. Multiple over-lapping error documentation processes are needed to capture and report TREs from within and outside of Blood Bank (BB). We present a comprehensive error management program along with data on five years of benchmarking TREs at a large academic medical center. Study Design/Method: TREs were detected by capturing and reporting of sample suitability, testing variances and biologic product deviations. In addition, TREs as observed and reported by providers and clinical staff (i.e. blood delays/undertransfusions, transfusions without consent, infusions with wrong fluids) were reported to the BB and hospital quality through the Veritas system, a hospital based reporting system that enables reporting any occurrence with potential for causing patient harm. All serious errors were reviewed daily and summation of TREs was discussed on a monthly basis. Mapping TREs within the \"vein-to-vein\" was performed by reviewing the fiveyear of transfusion medicine quality records (from 2012 to 2016). Patient harm events recorded within the Veritas system from January to July 2016 were investigated in depth. Transfusion reactions were excluded in this analysis.",

            "text": "Results/Finding: An average of 114 TREs per month and 1300 per year were found over five years. 81% of TREs are associated with pre-BB activities, 10% occur within BB, and 9% are post-BB events. Sample collection and handling represent 80% of total TREs. Most TREs (96%) were reported by BB staff, 4% were reported by non-BB staff. Patient harm analysis revealed an average of four Level 0 (near miss), three Level 1 (no known harm), and 0.3 Level 2 (patient harm) per month. No deaths related to TRE were detected over the seven month January to July 2016 period. Patient harm was associated with TREs occurring in the BB (17%) and post-BB (83%). These events were reported externally (78%) and by BB staff (22%). Conclusion: Although most TREs were detected in the pre-BB phase, no patient harm was associated with these events indicating an efficient capture prior to causing patient harm. The TREs causing patient harm, including near miss events, were mostly reported externally and they occurred entirely in the post-BB and BB phases. These results suggest that significant opportunities for quality improvement may be achieved in two areas: the pre-BB phase aimed at reduction of waste associated with sample collection and handling, and the post-BB and BB phases aimed at improving TRE detection and decreasing patient harm. Background/Case Studies: Uncrossmatched red blood cells (RBC) and emergency issued platelets (PLT), plasma and cryoprecipitate (CRYO) are lifesaving in a bleeding patient without a valid type and screen. Collectively termed \"emergently issued products\" they are issued as a bridge until pretransfusion testing is completed. This study evaluated the utilization and wastage rates of blood products during pregnancy-related hemorrhage where the first products issued were emergently issued. Study Design/Methods: A list of patients on whom blood products had been emergently issued between January 1, 2013 and March 28, 2017 was obtained from the blood bank at a regional maternity care hospital. Patients who were not experiencing a pregnancy-related bleed (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage or bleeding relating to a complication of pregnancy such as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or bleeding post spontaneous or therapeutic abortion) were excluded. The total number of products (emergently issued plus crossmatched or non-emergently issued products) that were transfused, returned back into the blood bank's inventory, and wasted within 6 hours of the first emergently issued products were enumerated. Apheresis PLT units were multiplied by 5 and added to the number of individual whole blood PLTs; apheresis plasma units were multiplied by 2 and added to the number of whole blood plasma units. Results/Findings: Seventy women who received emergently issued blood products during a pregnancy-related hemorrhage were identified. Average age was 31. The majority of these patients with pregnancy-related hemorrhage who received at least one unit of emergently issued blood products received at least one unit of the product that was issued to them and few units were wasted. That PLT wastage was higher than the other products was likely due to the 4-hour post-pooling room temperature shelf life. Keeping wastage rates low while meeting the clinical needs of these patients is the ideal situation for the blood bank. . Patient blood platelets were higher before prophylactic than therapeutic transfusions (18[10 9 /l vs. 14[10 9 /l, p50.029). There were no significant differences in the frequency of effective therapeutic (55% vs. 72%, p50.1) and prophylactic (63% vs. 54%, p50.09) transfusions between the PRCs and 25GyPCs. We did not find significant differences between PRCs and 25GyPCs in CCI1 after prophylactic (16.0 6 7.1 vs. 19.2 6 8.7) and therapeutic (11.3 6 9.0 vs. 11.8 6 5.8) transfusions, in CC24 after prophylactic (20.0 6 9.2 vs. 22.5 6 12.8) and therapeutic (13.3 6 8.9 vs. 13.9 6 8.) transfusions. There were no significant differences between PRCs and 25GyPCs also in MA1 after prophylactic (62.2 6 8.5 vs. 60 6 8.5, p50.7) and therapeutic (61.3 6 9.9 vs. 60.9 6 12.7, p50.08) PC transfusions. Reduction of the severity of bleeds was obtained in 78 (86%) of the 91 cases after PRPC transfusions and in 51 (84%) of 61 cases after 25GyPC transfusions. There were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse post-transfusion reactions between the groups (respectively, 3 and 2 cases). Background/Case Studies: An 'end-to-end' electronic transfusion management process including a bedside administration system was developed and implemented in this large multi-site academic center in 2006. It enables the safe administration of blood components at the patient bedside and provides an audit trail for all blood components. An error was identified in the electronic bedside transfusion process which was reported to our national hemovigilance scheme in 2014 under the category 'errors relating to information technology'. This error was the incorrect use of the emergency transfusion process for non-emergency transfusions. The standard (non-emergency) process requires a scan of the barcode on the patient's wristband containing their identification details which is verified against the same details from the barcode on the compatibility label attached to the blood bag. The emergency transfusion option is only intended for use with 'emergency group O RhD negative blood units' which, unlike non-emergency units allocated to specific patients, do not have a compatibility label. The emergency transfusion option skips the compatibility label barcode scan as the emergency units can be transfused to any patient needing urgent transfusion. It was found that the emergency blood option was being misused for non-emergency transfusions, leading to blood units not being checked to ensure they were for the correct patient. Study Design/Method: This center worked with the software supplier to develop a solution which corrects the weakness in the process. The revised process involves providing a universal compatibility label for emergency units so that all units (emergency and non-emergency) require a scan of the compatibility label on the blood bag and the patient's wristband at the bedside before transfusion. The use of the emergency process was audited pre and post implementation of the new process to determine whether it was being used correctly or not. Results/Finding: There were 593 units administered using the emergency transfusion process in the 3 months before the change was implemented. It was found that 51/593 (9%) units were non-emergency units administered incorrectly without a bedside compatibility check. Following the implementation of the change there were no instances of incorrect administration of non-emergency units in the next month (2530 components administered), 109/2530 (4%) were emergency units which were administered correctly. Users of the system reported the revised process was quicker, safer and unified with other functions on the device. Conclusion: The improved process for the administration of blood in an emergency now prevents users from following the incorrect procedure for non-emergency transfusions and missing the essential final bedside electronic check. This report indicates the need for continued vigilance of the functionality of electronic transfusion processes, and the correction of any weaknesses compromising patient safety.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Recent recommendations indicate one red blood cell (RBC) unit should be transfused at a time with reassessment after each transfusion to determine the need for more. However, the practices of Canadian transfusion medicine (TM) experts and what constitutes a reassessment are unknown. Therefore, we conducted a survey of TM experts across Canada to gather information on their practices and criteria for reassessment. Study Design/Method: TM experts were identified and contact information obtained from the Canadian National Advisory Committee (NAC) and from contacting least one TM expert per province. Each respondent was assigned a unique study ID after consenting to the survey, allowing for anonymity on analysis. The survey contained demographics, general practice questions, and questions regarding transfusion in: 1) a stable anemic inpatient, 2) a stable anemic inpatient to be discharged, and 3) an asymptomatic post-operative inpatient. Results/Finding: We identified 67 Canadian TM experts: 48 (71.6%) provided a response and most had a primary place of practice in a laboratory setting (38/48; 79.2%). For a stable, non-bleeding, anemic inpatient, 87.5% of respondents recommended transfusing one RBC unit, then reassessing. Recommendations were more variable in outpatient settings, with 31.2% generally recommending transfusing two RBC units then reassessing. Recommendations for reassessment were mainly functional status/symptoms and vitals within a short time period (1-2 hours), a repeat hemoglobin >18 hours later dependent on the clinical scenario, and a search for an underlying cause of anemia in outpatient settings. Lab practitioners emphasized volume status, cardiac examination, and transfusion at lower hemoglobin thresholds. With an asymptomatic patient to be discharged, fewer respondents chose to transfuse (38.1%) compared to an inpatient potentially symptomatic due to anemia (72.1%). None of the respondents suggested transfusion in an asymptomatic post-operative patient who had a hemoglobin trending down. Conclusion: TM experts generally recommend transfusing one unit at a time in stable inpatients. Assessment for transfusion should focus on patient symptoms, pertinent physical exam, hemoglobin levels, and an underlying cause. \"Top-up\" transfusions were not recommended. These recommendations may help guide clinicians, but further research is needed to generate higher quality evidence around the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of these practices. Background/Case Studies: Current evaluation of red blood cell (RBC) post transfusion recovery is based on ex vivo labeling of stored RBCs with radioactive chromium-51 ( 51 Cr). This method has several limitations including the risks associated with radioactivity, and the inability to evaluate multiple RBC populations in the recipient. RBC labeling with s-NHS-biotin (Bio-RBCs) overcomes many of these limitations and offers safe and longitudinal tracking of multiple transfused RBCs in vivo. The purpose of this study was to scale up and optimize the biotinylation procedures to the current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) environment. Study Design/Method: Packed RBC units (n514) were divided into two 150mL aliquots, which were labeled with selected concentrations of s-NHSbiotin (3 and 30 lg/mL) in a CGMP closed system (average Bio-RBCs hematocrit of 38.4 6 1.6%). Optimization of labeling efficacy was determined by flow cytometric analysis of Bio-RBCs using fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin (SA). Approximately 2 million RBCs were measured in triplicate. Quantum Simply Cellular Beads were used to quantify fluorochrome (molecules of equivalent soluble fluorescence, MESF) and infer number of biotin molecules per RBC. The lower limit of detection was determined for RBC labeled with varying amounts of biotin. Product quality and safety were evaluated by endotoxin and sterility testing, and by determining the levels of spontaneous hemolysis before and after RBC biotin labeling. Results/Finding: Investigation of different fluorochromes, laser excitation wavelengths and laser power to maximize the signal to noise ratio of labeled and unlabeled RBCs revealed that 561nm excitation of phycoerythrin (PE)-SA and high laser power (150mW) provided the best separation between the two Bio-RBC populations, and between labeled and unlabeled RBCs. Labeling with 3lg/mL of biotin resulted in $50,000 MESF/RBC, and were detectable among unlabeled RBC at a lower limit of detection (LLD, 95% CI) of 1 in 380,000 (0.0003%). The LLD95 for RBC labeled with biotin at 30lg/ mL was $ 1 in 1 million (0.0001%). Biotinylation was not associated with increased levels of hemolysis (0.40 6 0.22% before labeling versus 0.34 6 0.12% after labeling; p50.09) or bacterial contamination. Conclusion: The resulting manufacturing process produces large volumes (150mL/transfusion) of Bio-RBCs with low risk of contamination or hemolysis. The flow cytometry assay can detect Bio-RBC in unlabeled blood at very low frequency. We plan to use this technology to study the impact of donor characteristic on RBC storage stability and post-transfusion survival. Background/Case Studies: Blood products offer resuscitation benefits in trauma over crystalloid/colloid volume expanders (which provide no hemostatic benefit or oxygen delivery), but usage is often hampered by supply or storage needs. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) are not red cell replacements but may supplement oxygen delivery and expand volume during transport until blood is available. Since hemostasis is critical in resuscitation, this study evaluated bovine hemoglobin glutamer-250 (HBOC-201) effects on coagulation parameters alongside freeze-dried plasma (FDP) in an in vitro model of hemorrhage/resuscitation. Study Design/Method: Whole blood (WB) was collected from healthy donors under an approved institutional standard operating procedure. In the first study (limited resuscitation), samples were: (1) WB, (2) WB110% HBOC volume (model of two units in an adult), (3) WB110% FDP, and (4) WB110% HBOC110% FDP. Samples (5)-(8) simulated autoresuscitation by adding 25% plasmalyte to 1-4. Susceptibility to lysis was tested with 75ng/ml tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).",

While published literature has largely focused on the efficacy and safety of PCC, actual usage practices are less characterized. Our aim was to describe the PCC usage practices within a tertiary care center. Study Design/Method: We conducted a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of patients who received PCC between its addition to our institution's formulary in 8/2013 and 2/2015. We compiled information about the usage of PCC in these patients. Descriptive statistics were generated with Microsoft Excel. Results/Finding: Of 81 patients, 24 were on warfarin. PCC was most frequently prescribed for hemorrhage due to surgery (43%). PCC was given for warfarin reversal in 31% of cases. A subset of patients received plasma within 2 hours prior to PCC (40%) or 24 hours after (47%). PCC was most frequently ordered in the OR/perioperative service (25%). Conclusion: The majority of PCC usage was \"off-label\" in terms of being prescribed for indications other than warfarin reversal. The most frequent indication was hemorrhage due to surgery, and PCC was most often ordered in the OR/perioperative service. Although guidelines recommend the use of PCC as a plasma alternative, plasma was administered within hours of PCC in a notable subset of patients. Background/Case Studies: In Emergent situations, when a patient's life may be jeopardized by delaying transfusion, a physician may decide to transfuse blood emergently. However, in some cases, poor communication and lack of clear expectations between the Blood Bank and patient care areas can lead to frustration and delays in the timely provision of blood products. An incident prompted an appraisal of our emergency release protocol (ERP), which revealed gaps in communications and expectations by both the Blood Bank and nursing personnel. Thus, it is imperative that there is a standardized ER protocol with clear communications for both the Blood Bank and Nursing personnel. Reported here is the outcome of a process improvement that resulted in improved communication, expectations, and turnaround (TAT) for our ER protocol. Study Design/Method: In 2016, several meetings were conducted with stakeholders (Critical care units (ICU), emergency department (ED), internal medicine, interventional radiology (IR) etc.) in an effort to identify process gaps, improve communications, and expectations for ER episodes. The goals was to design a process for emergent blood product request and release in life threatening situations that will; 1) Simplify and expedite the process; 2) improve communication and expectations to decrease TAT; 3) improve patient safety and meet compliance. In order to achieve these goals, a series of activities were conducted. These included meetings with all stakeholders to ensure process improvement meet the needs intended. A series of training sessions with nurse educators in ICU, ED, IR and Surgery managers were conducted. During the meetings, communication goals, and expectations were defined and agreed upon. Training sessions included PowerPoint presentations to educate staff members and performance of dry runs, to identify weaknesses and strengths with the process flow. The impact on the current process was analyzed and, as a result, led to the revision of the current SOP, addition of pre-labeled Emergency Pack blood (4 units of O Neg RBC's) and implementation of an Electronic Emergency Blood order set. Results/Finding: In the ten months post implementation of our improved, standardized ER Pack Protocol, A total of 61 ER episodes were received. The average TAT from order to delivery at the bedside was reduced by 50% (7.0 minutes compared to 14 minutes previously), while the compliance rate for ER orders and physician documentation was 100% (61/61), with no current wastage of blood products. Conclusion: The implementation of the improved standardized ER protocol significantly improved communications and expectations, decreased TAT and delays in transfusions while ensuring patient safety and compliance to regulatory requirements. Background/Case Studies: Massive transfusion (MT) in the trauma setting has been extensively studied. Yet, the literature in non-trauma areas, especially oncology is rather sparse. The following study was conducted to understand the background and outcomes of MT in cancer patients. Study Design/Methods: This was a single center retrospective study performed at a large cancer center between February 2016 -February 2017. MT was defined as the transfusion of ! 10 RBC units in a 24-hour period. The following data were collected included: age, gender, primary diagnosis, surgery or acute care type, amount and type of blood components transfused, whether or not a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) was activated, and survival at 30 days. Results/Findings: Thirty MTs occurred during a one year period. A total of 192,441 blood products were transfused during that time period. Gender distribution was 21/30 (70%) males, and the average age of all patients was 68 with a range of 21 to 70 years of age. Surgical patients accounted for 26/30 (86.7%) MTs, and 4/30 (13.3%) were critical care patients. Tumor categories included carcinomas (14/30), sarcomas (13/30), leukemias (2/30) and lymphoma (1/30). Resection of tumor followed by complex reconstruction was the cause of the majority of MTs. Metastatic renal cancer (6/30) was the most common disease seen followed by sacral chordoma (4/30). MTPs were activated in only 8/30 (26.7%) cases. Thirty-day survival was seen in 25/30 (83.3%) patients. Only 1 of 5 mortalities was a surgical case (peritoneal mesothelioma), and the remainder were caused by GI hemorrhage (3/ 5) or perisplenic hematoma (1/5).

Administration of a synthetic blood product resulted in dark maroon colored plasma. The most common cause of a dark red color is hemolysis of the sample, which is usually discarded. In this instance, the hemoglobin color was due to the infused product, an experimental bovine pegylated carboxyhemoglobin that affects colorimetric evaluation of blood samples. With this in mind, the sample was not discarded and testing was completed by tube method.",

Common causes of white plasma include purulence, hypertriglyceridemia, and sampling of blood drawn proximal to administration of radiopaque agents such as propofol. Although an etiology could not be identified a repeat specimen drawn several hours later was clear. Conclusion: These cases highlight the importance of an appropriate evaluation of discolored plasma. Once a discolored sample is identified, a repeat sample is required to confirm the change in color. In the first two cases, the discoloration persisted, prompting further clinical investigation. Once the etiology was identified, need for further testing and eligibility for further transfusion was determined. Testing by tube method could be performed in two cases. In the third case, repeated sampling revealed a clear sample and the transfusion process continued without delay. Decisions regarding the analytic phase of testing must include reevaluation of the sample, identification of the etiology, and comprehension regarding how to proceed when discoloration persists.",

Dara interferes with blood bank testing as it binds to CD38 expressed on red blood cells, causing pan reactivity. The Dara interference can be overcome with the use of dithiothreitol (DTT) treated reagent red blood cells. To minimize alloimmunization and to provide crossmatch compatible blood to treated patients, we instituted a Dara protocol in our blood bank. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the outcomes of our protocol, with a particular focus on the development of de novo alloantibodies during Dara treatment at our institution. Study Design/Method: All Dara patients' antibody workups were completed using DTT pre-treated reagent red blood cells. If the antibody screen was negative, K antigen negative RBC products are provided. If an antibody is identified, K negative along with that particular antigen negative blood is provided. Our electronic medical record (EMR) was searched for patients who received Dara over the past eight months. Study subjects were examined to see if they had pre-existing alloantibodies before Dara treatment and whether they formed new alloantibodies during Dara treatment. The age, gender, type and screen pre-Dara treatment, type and screen post-Dara, intervening blood transfusions, and the date of first Dara treatment was recorded. Results/Finding: Overall, 54 subjects were identified for analysis. Their mean age was 67.8 years, with 29 male and 25 female subjects; all were diagnosed with multiple myeloma. We found an alloimmunization rate of 0% (0/54) prior to administration of Dara. Of these patients, 22 were transfused with red blood cells (RBCs) after initiation of Dara therapy. Following our testing/matching protocol, none of these (0%; 0/22) patients formed a confirmed, new alloantibody during Dara treatment; each of these patients underwent at least one follow-up screen after their first RBC unit. We also found no complications in providing crossmatch compatible units to any of the 22 patients. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest case series reporting on results of overcoming Dara interference with blood bank type and screen testing. The protocol implemented in our laboratory appears to be successful in providing compatible units and preventing alloimmunization in patients receiving Dara therapy. It is possible that the drug, targeting antibody forming cells, may have an immunosuppressive effect on the humoral response; further studies of this effect may be warranted.",

Due to the infrequent occurrence of these incidents, the liquid plasma would outdate before use. A policy to use liquid plasma in nonemergent situations when the units were nearing their expiration dates was implemented. This study evaluated the effects of that policy on INR values of plasma recipients. Study Design/Methods:A retrospective analysis was developed to compare the effectiveness of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and liquid plasma (LQP) in changing INR values of recipients. All plasma units transfused within the facility from September 1, 2015 through April 7, 2017 were identified. The following data was obtained from the hospital and laboratory information systems for each unit: the recipient, primary reason for transfusion of plasma, number of plasma units transfused, type of plasma transfused, preand post-transfusion INR values, and whether or not vitamin K was administered. Patients were divided into groups based on the type of plasma units transfused and were evaluated based on primary reason for transfusion, number of units transfused, and administration of vitamin K. The change in INR for each recipient was calculated, along with the average change in INR for each group. Background/Case Studies: In gynaecological settings, most but not all relatively young anaemic women are iron deficient due to blood loss associated with menstruation. Transfusion could generally be avoided in those without haemodynamic instability. The oral antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid is an effective and well tolerated treatment for menorrhagia. Besides, iron replacement is often necessary for a prolonged period of time after normalization of haemoglobin (Hb). The present study attempted to look into transfusion appropriateness and the use of iron and tranexamic acid in transfused women in Hong Kong. Study Design/Methods: Anonymous data of gynaeological patients age 60 was retrieved from a central database of public hospitals which included age, number of units of red cell transfused, pre-and posttransfusion Hb, the use of iron and/or tranexamic acid during hospitalization and upon discharge. All transfusion episodes associated with surgical operations during same admission are excluded. Results/Findings: In 2016, 2,523 unique women receiving a total of 5,889 units of red cells (RC) in 2,906 transfusion episodes were identified. Their median age was 45 (range 11 -60).

As a result, 1385 (47.7%) episodes resulted in a post transfusion Hb ! 9g/dL. Parenteral iron or tranexamic acid was uncommon during hospitalization and was given 2 (<0.1%) and 116 (4.6%) women respectively. Upon discharge, 442 (15.0%), 84 (3.2%) and 1,994 (65.8%) women were prescribed with oral iron alone, oral tranexamic acid alone or both respectively. However, neither were given to 386 (16.0%) women. Conclusion: In the present study, it is observed that 49.7% transfusion episodes were given at Hb ! 7g/dL. A substantial number of episodes (71.7%) were transfused with multiple units and resulted in almost half having a post transfusion Hb level (! 9g/dL). For iron replenishment and bleeding control, up to 16.0% transfused women were not given iron or tranexamic acid at discharge. The results indicate that awareness of both transfusion appropriateness and iron deficiency anaemia management have to be improved. It is recommended that in-depth education and training should be provided for a better gynaecological patient blood management. Background/Case Studies: Granulocyte transfusions may be utilized to boost the immune response in patients with life-threatening neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction and evidence of treatment-refractory bacterial or fungal infection. However, granulocytes are rarely administered due to uncertainty regarding efficacy, difficulty in collection, and increased propensity for adverse reactions. We report a case of granulocyte transfusion therapy following chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy in a patient with severe neutropenia and multiple infections in the context of relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Study Design/Method: Granulocytes (0.8-1.3x10 10 per unit) were collected from ABO-identical unstimulated donors at a regional blood center. Each unit was irradiated with 25 Gy and transfused over 3-4 hours within 24 hours after the time of collection. The patient's response and laboratory data were reviewed in the medical record. Conclusion: This data suggests that a diagnosis of AML is associated with anti-HLA antibodies. An increased frequency of blood group A in patients with AML has been reported, but here no statistically significant difference between ABO blood group frequencies was found in any category except the patient's with HLA antibodies. Blood group B has a significant association with HLA alloimmunization in the studied patients. It has been reported in a large study of female blood donors that no difference in HLA antibody frequency was observed based on ABO blood group at centers using the flow-based assay. Although the reasons for the higher rate of group B blood type among patients with anti-HLA antibodies and hematologic malignancies is unknown, this could be due to variation in immunizing events (pregnancy vs transfusion) or immune dysregulation related to the hematologic malignancy, especially AML. Females with AML who are blood group B appear to be most likely to have HLA alloimmunization among patients with hematologic malignancies.",

The rate of mistransfusion has remained unchanged in over 50 years. Attempts have been made to reduce mistransfusion including barrier devices, barcoding and RFID. Within a Regional Background/Case Studies: The role of donor age and sex on hemoglobin content and susceptibility to hemolysis during storage of red blood cell (RBC) units is receiving increased attention. However, the impact of donor characteristics on efficacy of RBC transfusion has not been studied in largescale donor-recipient outcomes databases. Study Design/Methods: We conducted an analysis using blood donor data routinely collected by a blood center and transfusion recipient data from a large community hospital network between 2008 and 2011 before patient blood management initiatives. Linkage was performed between blood donor characteristics and hospitalized RBC transfusion recipients who received a single RBC unit. Studied exposures for this analysis were blood donor sex and age in addition to RBC storage age. The Wilcoxon test was used to examine changes in hemoglobin level following RBC transfusion, and , and 38% were male. Recipients of RBC's from male and female donors had similar pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels (8.7 g/dL; p50.94); however, transfusion recipients of male donor RBC units had higher post-transfusion hemoglobin levels and larger increments in hemoglobin compared to those of female RBC units (9.9 vs 9.8 g/dL; 1.2 vs. 1.1 g/dL; both p50.02). Female recipients had a larger rise in hemoglobin per RBC unit compared to male recipients (1.3 g/dL vs. 1.0 g/dL; p<0.001). Female sex of the recipient remained a significant predictor of change in hemoglobin after accounting for recipient age and estimated circulating blood volume in multivariable analysis (p50.01). RBC storage age and the age of the donor were not significant factors in changes in hemoglobin levels in multivariable analysis, p50.53 and p50.32, respectively. Conclusion: RBC units from male donors resulted in a larger rise in hemoglobin levels compared to those from female donors, and these changes were more apparent in female recipients even after accounting for effective circulating blood volumes. This suggests that the dose of hemoglobin is lower in female than male RBC units. This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using this approach to study the association between donor characteristics and RBC efficacy, hemolysis and other donor-component-recipient interactions.",

However, as a group they can present a special challenge in medicine due to a religious aversion to blood products, based on biblical readings. The degree of this religious refusal can vary from individual to individual, but as institutional policy, a conservative approach is warranted. However, in large institutions where multiple teams manage a single patient, blood refusal information can be lost or poorly communicated from provider to provider. As such, a system to alert providers of patient blood refusal was recently implemented through the electronic medical record in a large west-coast institution. Study Design/Method: The electronic medical record (EMR) utilized in this study in an institutionally modified version of EPIC EA Best Practices Alert (BPA) was designed to trigger each time an end user attempted to place orders related to blood transfusion, transfusion-related lab testing, or human-derived pharmacy items on patients with blood refusal codes in their history, problem list, or religion (Jehovah's Witness) discrete data fields. The alert constitutes a \"soft-stop\" in which the ordering provided is prompted to either cancel the triggering orders or acknowledge the blood refusal/religious history and override the warning with an option to select a reason for the override. Data on the triggers are automatically collected through the EMR systems and generated into a report by informatics personnel. Results/Finding: The available data covers triggers in the two month postimplementation of the BPA. The BPA triggered 33 times in total, affecting 15 patients and 21 users. Stratified by location, the majority of triggers occurred in the perioperative areas (18 times) and the liver ICU (6 times) with a minority occurring on the regular hospital floors and emergency department. Nurses, attendings, residents, pharmacists, and nurse anesthesiologists were the users affected.

At our institution the transfusion medicine service (TMS) reviews and makes recommendations to clinicians for all inappropriate cryoprecipitate orders. We aimed at analyzing the effectiveness of this intervention in reaching target fibrinogen levels in under-estimated and over-estimated orders. Study Design/Method: We conducted a 7-month retrospective study (January-July 2016) of adult cryoprecipitate order quality assurance forms. The reference range for fibrinogen was 200-400 mg/dl with critical value of 50mg/dl. Cryoprecipitate orders for massive transfusion protocol, from operating rooms and for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were not reviewed by the TMS. During the study period, TMS evaluated orders for appropriateness of dosing and agreement with estimated required doses. Post-transfusion fibrinogen levels due to intervention were compared with hypothesized no intervention levels. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square and t-tests. Results/Finding: There were 301 adult (>18 years) orders reviewed by TMS out of which 299 were approved. Of the 299 approved orders, 136 (45.5%) were in agreement with TMS's estimated dose. Of 163 (54.5%) orders that were not in agreement with the TMS's estimate, 142 (47%) were underestimated and 21 (7%) were overestimated. Seventeen of 299 orders had no post-transfusion fibrinogen levels. Without intervention, there would have been a median deficit of 23.6 mg/dl (range 0.3 to 124 mg/dl) and a median excess of 13.3 mg/dl (range 0.6 to 155 mg/dl) of fibrinogen from the target. Median difference between target and actual post-transfusion fibrinogen level was 12 mg/dl above target, which is significantly higher with intervention than without (which could have been 12 mg/dl below the target; p<0.0001). Median differences between target and post-transfusion fibrinogen levels for the group with agreement between approved and requested units was not significantly different from possible differences without intervention (11 vs. 2.7 mg/dl, p50.07). Median differences between target and post-transfusion fibrinogen levels for the group with non-agreement between approved and requested units was significantly different from possible difference without intervention (15 vs. -23.5 mg/dl, p<0.0001). Seven of 299 (17) 40 (24) orders were for critically low fibrinogen (<50 mg/dl) and 4 of these were under-estimated requests and reached target fibrinogen with TMS's estimate and approval of required units to be transfused. Overall most frequent orders were 10 and 5 units (59.5% and 25%) i.e. 2 and 1 pools and the most frequent orders in the disagreement group were 10, 1, 5 and 2 units (33%, 20%, 17% and 16%). There is a significant difference between agreement and disagreement groups based on clinical service ordering the units (Table) . Conclusion: Intervention by TMS to review and approve cryoprecipitate orders was associated with increased accuracy of orders and achievement of desired target fibrinogen levels. Further studies are needed to develop multidisciplinary strategies for accurate cryoprecipitate dosage.

This study suggests it may not be beneficial and may be harmful to transfuse plasma for correction when INR is 1.9. Randomized trials are needed to assess whether the INR is a rational tool to measure bleeding risk, and whether prophylactic treatment with plasma yields any benefit. 3 of the 111 patients experienced bleeding complications indicating that INR of 1.9 may be considered safe in some lower risk procedures. Current practices may provide little or no benefit, with substantial risk of life threatening complications. Background/Case Studies: Group AB plasma, which lacks anti-A and anti-B antibodies, is considered to be the universal plasma donor and is used in the emergency setting before the patient's blood group is available. Approximately 4% of the population is group AB, which limits the available inventory of group AB plasma. Of group AB population, only plasma from male donors are considered suitable for transfusion since females, especially multiparous female donors, have a greater propensity to develop antibodies that can cause transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). This makes type AB plasma a limited resource. Our hospital is a level one trauma center, where a significant amount of plasma transfusion is required for severely bleeding patients before their blood type is known. Group O individuals make up 45 % of the population and have no A or B antigens on their cells. Group A is the second most prevalent blood group in the US population (40%) and has no B antigen on their cells. So, group A plasma is compatible with both group O and A patients, approximately 85% of the patient population. Before patient's blood type is known, type O red cell units are transfused with A plasma, which decreases the chance of hemolysis. To conserve AB plasma, we instituted a policy effective July 1, 2014 as follows: 2 units of group A plasma and 3 units of group AB plasma is provided for the Massive transfusion protocol (MTP) along with 5 units of O negative RBC until patient blood type is known. Study Design/Method: This prospective study is designed to monitor the use of group A plasma in MTPs at our institution and to evaluate the risk and severity of hemolysis in patients transfused with incompatible plasma. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is performed if patient received incompatible plasma. If DAT is positive, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin and bilirubin levels are obtained to detect possible hemolytic transfusion reaction. Results/Finding: We reviewed 235 MTPs at our institution between July 2014 and March 2017. Twenty patients (8.5 %) were transfused with incompatible group A plasma (5 group AB and 15 group B patients). Five patients died due to severe injury, and follow-up testing of these patients could not be performed. The remaining 15 patients had negative DAT, indicating the lack of significant amount of antibody coating their red cells, which could lead to hemolysis. None of these patients developed acute hemolytic reaction, or any other adverse effects of incompatible plasma transfusion.",

By 2016, HLA platelet orders increased dramatically and the IRL sent out over 650 special platelet products. The purpose of this abstract is to illuminate the methods used to fulfill increased client need that occurred in a short period of time. Study Design/Methods: Bonfils Blood Center has over 10,000 donors in the database with historical HLA typing. However, only approximately 3500 of those donors actively donate. In the Denver area, one of the most common HLA types is A1 A2 B7 B8. Only 81 of the 10,000 donors have this type (0.81%). Therefore, to fill an HLA platelet order request for a common HLA type, only 28 donors in the system would be a perfect HLA match. With that low number of donors, it is not likely that there would be a platelet on the shelf ready to fill the order. After a donor is recruited and donates, it takes at least two days to fill an order. For a less uncommon HLA type like A9 A11 B17 B35, there is only 1 out of 10,000 donors (0.01%) that match perfectly. In those cases, there are no donors to recruit to fill such an order. In some complicated cases, the IRL was provided with an HLA antibody list or Panel Reactive Antibody test (PRA). In order to find product for these patients, lists of platelets in inventory with corresponding HLA types were printed. If a patient had an antibody to A1 for example, all of the A1 positive platelets were crossed off the list. This cross-out process would continue manually until the only platelets on the list were the ones positive for HLA antigens to which the patient did not have antibodies. These platelets are PRA matched to the patient.",

The blood center medical director began suggesting that hospital clients order a PRA for each patient with platelet refractoriness. The PRA test is fast and it is a definitive method to discern HLA antibody mediated refractoriness from platelet refractoriness due to other causes. Results/Findings: In all but the most complicated cases with rare HLA patient phenotypes, it was much easier to find a PRA patient matched platelet on the shelf than an HLA match donor. In 2012, approximately 27% of these special order platelets were PRA matched and the remaining 73% were HLA matched by donor recruitment. By 2017, approximately 59% of special platelets sent are PRA matched. This change resulted in a 2.2 fold increase of finding product in inventory to fill orders quickly. Conclusion: Developing a system to provide PRA matched platelets is a faster alternative to finding HLA matched platelets thus contributing to better patient care. Background/Case Studies: In urgent cases where large amounts of blood products are needed quickly, maintaining a standard massive transfusion protocol (MTP) is critical to the timely delivery of these products. Each MTP pack at UCM contains 6 packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 4 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units, and 1 plateletpheresis pack; a unit of prepooled cryoprecipitate is also given if the patient is in Labor and Delivery (L&D) or if one is requested. At UCM, blood products are generally transported through the pneumatic tube system (PTS). We undertook a review of our MTP issuing practices and efficiency patterns over the last three and half years. Study Design/Method: The electronic archives of the Blood Bank laboratory information system and electronic medical record at our institution were queried for patients who had MTP activations. The archives were correlated to paper copies of these activations to collect data pertaining to the relevant information such as where the order originated from, how quickly the first product was sent out, how many products were transfused, and so on. Results/Finding: Between August 2013 to March 2017 MTPs were activated at UCM, of which 251 orders could be traced to the origin: 118 on inpatient floor (including ICUs), 58 in the operating rooms, 46 in the Emergency Department, 25 in Labor and Delivery, and 4 in other procedure rooms.",

As our institution anticipates the introduction of an adult level 1 trauma center, we anticipate this balance will shift. In addition, the data shows that (with the exception of cryoprecipitate) the utilization rate is nearly identical among the blood products sent during MTP activations ($60-70%). Again, we anticipate utilization rate of issued MTP products to increase with the introduction of a new adult trauma center.

Our MTP was officially implemented in 2013 in preparation for an initial verification as a Level 1 Trauma Center by ACS. Our MTP has the following packages: 1st pack has a ratio of 4:4:1 (RBCS, Plasma & Platelets) and subsequent packs a ratio of 6:6:1. Our MTP also includes Prothrombin Time (PT), activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and Fibrinogen testing after each pack is transfused. This data is used to assess the patient and allows the transfusion service and clinical team to identify coagulopathies. However, attempts to supplement MTP packs with cryoprecipitate (CRYO) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) were challenging to accomplish in a timely manner. Study Design/Methods: Due to challenges in timely supplementation of MTP packages with CRYO and PCC, the protocol was modified in March 2016 to add CRYO and PCC at a defined point in the MTP (CRYO is included in the 3rd pack and PCC in the 4th pack). In order to validate this modification of adding these products at defined intervals regardless of laboratory data, we decided to review all patients that received >20 RBC at our institution as these massively hemorrhaging patients would receive PCC based on our current protocol. We reviewed the blood products received by these patients and their available laboratory data. Results/Findings: We had 8 patients who received >20 RBC in 2015 and 2016. MTP had been activated for all patients and all patients received between 0.5 to 1 unit of plasma for each RBC unit transfused. Despite receiving these ratios of blood products, all patients had elevations of their PT >16 seconds and many had elevations of the aPTT and fibrinogen levels less than our institution's target of 200 mg/dL (Table 1) . As anticipated, improvement in the coagulation parameters was noted with CRYO and PCC supplementation. Conclusion: Our data on massively hemorrhaging patients supports a role for supplementation of our MTP with CRYO and PCC in patients who require transfusion of >20 RBC. Our current protocol with the addition of CRYO and PCC at defined intervals has streamlined the process and improved timely provision of these products in bleeding coagulopathic patients.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Red blood cell hemolysis is a key finding for a diagnosis of transplant-associated passenger lymphocyte syndrome (TA-PLS). However, whether a hematopoietic stem cell or organ transplant recipient experiences hemolysis when a transplant contains unintended antibody-forming passenger lymphocytes depends, by chance, on the recipient's blood group phenotype. A living donor liver segment transplant resulted in a case of TA-PLS with donor-derived anti-D that had the potential for causing a clinically significant hemolytic event. The donor's plasma contained anti-D. Anti-D was absent in the recipient's pre-transplant plasma, but present in the recipient's 5-day and 114-day post-transplant plasma. Although these findings established a diagnosis of TA-PLS, hemolysis did not occur because the recipient's blood group phenotype was D-. The conventional focus on hemolysis, rather than on the transfer of antibody-forming lymphocytes, is a diversion from the primary pathophysiology of PLS and limits capturing the true scope of the syndrome. Study Design/Method: To determine the standard of practice for detecting and diagnosing TA-PLS, a retrospective 10-year PubMed search for peerreviewed English-language journal articles was conducted using key words \"passenger lymphocyte syndrome.\" Cases were categorized according to the presence or absence of hemolysis and whether there was a routine antibody screen to detect donor-derived, passenger lymphocyte-formed blood group antibodies. Results/Finding: Of 63 published cases (31 reports) of TA-PLS, 8 (4 reports) were stem cell and 55 (27 reports) were organ transplants. All 8(100%) stem cell transplants and 52 (95%) organ transplants were associated with hemolysis, reflecting an overwhelming bias for identifying TA-PLS associated with hemolysis. Of the 4 reports of stem cell TA-PLS, 3 actively screened for antibodies in the immediate post-transplant period, and of the 27 reports of organ TA-PLS, 1 actively screened for antibodies. These screens detected 5 cases of stem cell TA-PLS before hemolysis became apparent and 2 cases of organ TA-PLS with antibodies without hemolysis. It can be inferred that TA-PLS is currently under-diagnosed, because hemolysis is not consistently present and/or antibody screens are not performed routinely. Conclusion: A new category of \"non-hemolytic TA-PLS\" is recommended to capture otherwise undiagnosed cases where TA-passenger lymphocytes form blood group antibodies in the recipient, but hemolysis does not occur, as in our aforementioned case. To ensure including the full scope of TA-PLS, an antibody screen should be performed routinely one week after transplant and repeated as clinically indicated.",

The patient remained stable for 5 months when his Hb level acutely dropped to 6.6 g/dL. The antibody screen remained negative for an additional 2 months when it became positive for anti-Jka and anti-Mur. Donor ethnicity data was available for 30 of the 33 RBC units he received. 3 units were from an Asian donor, and a unit transfused 13 days prior to the Hb drop was from a Caucasian/Chinese donor.

Results/Finding: 6.6% of donors identified as Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, or other Southeastern Asian. These donors account for 5245 of 37933 (13.8%) RBC collections. Conclusion: Identification of anti-Mur in this patient was triggered by the presence of a concurrent anti-Jka alloantibody. Since over 10% of the RBC supply in the local blood center was collected from Chinese or Southeast Asian donors, chronically transfused patients are at risk of developing anti-Mur-mediated hemolysis that could be missed on a standard screen.

Manual direct tube testing is associated with variability in results (poor reproducibility/precision) and is also time and resource intensive. In fact, studies have shown a three-to eightfold inter-institutional difference between the antibody titers from the same samples using manual tube method. The OrthoVision automated analyzers offers automated titering of patient plasma using gel technology. Although there is intense interest in adopting automated testing technology for titering, it is well-appreciated that titers obtained in manual gel testing are much higher than those obtained by manual/direct tube testing. The higher titer results lack clinical fetal anemia and outcome correlations, which is a barrier to their implementation. Moreover, despite the increased sensitivity of gel testing, prior studies have found variable results with regard to reproducibility and precision. [3] [4] [5] There is minimal information on the comparisons of tube titers to OrthoVIsion automated titers or assessment of the reproducibility of this automated method. Study Design/Method: Rh and non Rh minor RBC antibody titrations were performed by manual direct tube method on clinical samples and the same samples were analyzed on three different ORTHO VISION analyzers to assess precision and inter-instrument reproducibility. Results/Finding: A total of 26 samples have been analyzed (Table) , 17 Rh and 9 non-Rh antigens. Titers via automated testing on OrthoVision resulted in a mean titration being 2.77 (range 1-7) times higher. The average fold change for RhD/C/E antibody titers were 3.2, whereas the average fold change for non Rh titers was 1.03 (range 1-2). The range for anti D titers was particularly variable, 2-7, whereas for C/E, it was 1-3. The overall reproducibility/precision of the automated analyzer was $90%. To correlate the 178A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 increased titers observed with some classes of antibodies, particularly anti D, we will be performing parallel testing of obstetric samples and correlating with pregnancy outcome/fetal testing the obtained values.",

DTM/CC/NIH Background/Case Studies: Isoagglutinins in the plasma of apheresis platelets are a concern during transfusion, as high titer anti-A and/or anti-B may cause a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) in a recipient with cognate antigen. Apheresis platelet collections are usually reconstituted with donor plasma, however most facilities do not test for high titer of isoagglutinins, exposing recipients to the risk of HTR due to plasma incompatibility if given based on short outdate and not ABO type. At our facility testing is performed on all apheresis platelets with a cutoff titer of 250. Units above the cutoff are marked as \"high titer\" and only given to ABO plasma-compatible recipients or washed with saline to reduce plasma. However, washing platelets is a time consuming process that results in a loss of up to 33% of the platelets. Platelet additive solution (PAS) is used as an alternative collection and storage solution, replacing approximately 65% of donor plasma in the final product. The goal of this study was to determine what affect PAS has on isoagglutinin titers and whether using PAS could lead to a revision of one facility's procedure for management out of group platelet transfusions. Study Design/Method: Isoagglutinin titers of whole blood EDTA samples were compared to the final apheresis platelet unit collected in PAS (Intersol, Fresenius Kabi, Lake Zurich, IL). Using two-fold dilution steps, plasma was tested with pooled red cells (equal mix 0.8% suspension of A1 and B cells, Ortho, Raritan, NJ) in a gel matrix test (MTS Buffered card, Ortho, Raritan, NJ) with 15 min incubation (room temperature) prior to centrifugation (MTS Ortho Workstation).

Nearly half of the group O donors exceeded a titer of 250 when whole blood specimens were tested. Conclusion: Only one sample from apheresis platelets collected in PAS exceeded our clinically applied titer threshold of 250, a 96% decrease from the number of whole blood specimens exceeding the threshold. Testing the platelet bag collected in PAS instead of plasma from whole blood specimens would lower the number of units exceeding the high titer threshold, and reduce products needing to be washed. Furthermore, facilities not collecting platelets on site or without access to whole blood specimens from donors could implement the process described here and screen platelet apheresis collections for potentially clinically adverse isoagglutinin titers, whether collected using PAS or not. other components. The majority of blood components in Israel are collected and distributed by Magen David Adom (MDA), from 2 main locations. Several hospitals in Israel also collect platelets in-house. As part of an effort to understand PLT utilization, a nationwide survey of PLT transfusion and expiration was conducted. Study Design/Methods: Data on the disposition of all PLT units, acquired from MDA and collected in-house, during the calendar year 2016 was requested from all hospitals in Israel. The number of PLT distributed to hospitals by MDA was also collected. PLT wastage was defined as the sum of PLT that were returned and not reissued from the hospital blood banks and PLT that expired on blood bank shelves. Results/Findings: Sixteen of the 27(59%) hospitals in Israel, along with MDA, participated in the survey, listed as A to P. The results are presented in the table along with each hospital's distance from the 2 MDA facilities. For some hospitals, the sum of transfused and wasted PLT was slightly less than the number of PLT supplied by MDA; this is likely due to the small number of PLT that had not either been transfused or expired by the time the data collection period ended. Three of the largest hospitals (C, B and A) collected PLT in-house in addition to acquiring units from MDA. These 3 hospitals had a lower overall rate of wastage including their own donations than the other 13 hospitals that did not collect in-house PLT. The other 13 hospitals had wastage rates ranging between 9-54%. No correlation was apparent between the hospital's distance from the MDA facility or its number of beds and the PLT wastage rate.",

Most commonly in such cases Group O platelets having high titer anti-A result in clinically significant hemolysis when transfused to a Group A or AB recipient. We present a patient with a possible hemolytic reaction following transfusion of ABO mismatched platelets presenting in the setting of underlying disease associated hemolysis. Study Design/Method: A 58-year-old male with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis was evaluated for possible transfusion reaction to a single donor platelet (SDP). Two hours post transfusion he developed chills, rigors, and increased blood pressure (117/65 mm Hg to 205/89 mm Hg) followed by hematuria (500 mL). Chills and rigors resolved; blood pressure stabilized after 15 min with diphenhydramine, solumedrol, and acetaminophen. negative. Patient ABO group, Rh (D) type and antibody screen on pre-and post-transfusion specimens showed no discrepancies. Laboratory indicators of hemolysis are summarized in Table. Notably, while total/ indirect bilirubin increased and hemoglobin decreased after transfusion other tests were indeterminate for hemolytic transfusion reaction with abnormal pretransfusion levels. Despite underlying disease associated hemolysis, the blood supplier of the unit was contacted to investigate into the possibility of high titer donor anti-A. This revealed donor anti-A titer results of 256 (IgM) and 1,024 (IgG); donor was deferred from future platelet donations. Conclusion: While the post-transfusion sample had no visible hemolysis and a negative DAT, increased total/ indirect bilirubin after transfusion and high titer donor anti-A are supportive of immune mediated hemolytic transfusion reaction. The key unique aspect in this case is baseline underlying hemolysis, which may mask needs for further investigation of donor for high titer anti-A.",

Despite improvements in hemostatic , surgical, and anaesthetic techniques, liver transplantation is still associated with massive blood loss and high rates of transfusion requirements. Peri and intraoperative transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) have been previously reported as major predictors of post -operative mortality . Identifying predictive factors for transfusion requirements may help optimise patient blood management strategies in OLT. We conducted a single center retrospective analysis of 671 cases of OLT performed between 2011 and 2015 in Brazil in order to identify predictive factors for red blood cell transfusion Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis in a single institution was performed, and charts of 671 consecutive patients submitted to liver transplantation between 2011 and 2016 were reviewed. The following variables were collected for each patient: gender, race, primary diagnosis, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, age, body mass index, corrected model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), duration of warm and cold ischemia. Categorical variables were analysed using Pearson chi-square test. Continuous variables were analysed using t-Student test. A forward logistic regression model was used to analyse data in a multivariate fashion, to identify independent contribution of variables previously found to be significant. Results/Finding: In univariate analysis, female patients, absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), primary diagnosis, corrected MELD and warm ischemia time were significantly associated with consumption of RBC use in the intraoperative period. Multivariate logistic regression of these factors showed that female patients (OR 1,726 -95% CI: 1,147-2,597, p:0,009), absence of HCC (OR 0,295 -95% CI:0,199-0,437, p:0,0), cirrhosis of any cause (OR 4,161 -95% CI 1,816-9,534 -p:0,001), miscellaneous diagnosis (auto-immune, metabolic diseases, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, vascular complications) (OR 5,236 95%IC 2,212-12,394) and retransplantation due to primary non function of the graft (OR 5,791 95%CI 1,33-4,25,206, p: 0,019) were independently associated with RBC transfusion requirements. Conclusion: In this study, female patients, absence of HCC, specific primary diagnosis and retransplantation due to primary non function of the graft were significantly associated with RBC consumption in intraoperative period. Determination of RBC transfusion predictors before surgery might provide important information regarding management of blood components and help optimise utilisation of resources for blood conservation strategies.",

Childers* 1 , Mark Destree 2 , Ashley Rose 2 and Theresa Nester 3,4 . 1 Madigan Army Medical Center, 2 Bloodworks Northwest, 3 Bloodworks NW, 4 Dept of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington Background/Case Studies: With platelet substitution policies, minor ABOincompatible platelets (where donor's plasma may contain antibodies to recipient's red blood cells) are often issued in an effort to best utilize the community supply. However, rare reports of acute intravascular hemolysis have been reported from such transfusions, and can be attributed to high Anti-A1 or anti-B titers, typically in a group O donor. One method to reduce the risk of hemolysis is to identify high titer platelet units prior to transfusion with a subsequent intervention. The percentage of high titer Anti-A1/B in group O platelet products is presented from a large regional blood center collected over 10-12 months. Data from both pre-storage pooled platelet units (PSPP) and apheresis derived platelet units (APLT) is shown. Study Design/Method: Platelet component samples were collected in 2 mL EDTA sample tubes. A single 1:150 dilution of plasma was prepared using a Hamilton MicroLAB 600 series dilutor using 2235.0 mL saline diluent and 15.0 mL platelet component sample. Using a standard transfer pipette, two drops of diluted sample were transferred to each reaction tube along with one drop of A1 or B red blood cell reagent. Reaction tubes were centrifuged immediately in a serological centrifuge at 3175 rpm for 20 seconds. Reactions were read using a lighted agglutination reader. The presence of macroscopic agglutination (weak or greater) with either the A1 cells or B cells was recorded as a positive reaction, indicative of a high titer Anti-A1 or Anti-B. Retesting of samples was performed to confirm high titers. Results/Finding:",

In our example, the Bloodworks transfusion service was able to change from a policy of volume reducing any group O apheresis platelets being issued to a group A or AB patient, to giving high titer products to only group O patients. The subsequent decrease in episodes of volume reduction helped to improve overall availability of apheresis platelets, by maintaining their 5 day outdate. After 10 months of testing PSPP units and verifying that the products rarely had a high titer (0.28%), the blood center stopped performing this testing for PSPP units. Rh1) ] started complaining of worsening back pain two and half hours after receiving one unit of RBC for a drop in hematocrit to 19% (from 24% on the previous day). His hematocrit did not increase (18%), and over the ensuing 12 hours, he became anuric and jaundiced. Clerical checks confirmed that his forward type was A positive, which was also the type of the RBC unit transfused, but revealed anti-A at a titer of 8 in his plasma. Furthermore, the direct antiglobulin tests (DAT) were positive for C3 in the pre-and post-transfusion blood samples. Anti-A was not detected in his plasma collected three days earlier, however. Although his plasma color was amber, he had signs of intravascular hemolysis: undetectable haptoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total and indirect bilirubin Results/Finding: The positive DAT in the pre-transfusion sample pointed to ongoing hemolysis prior to the transfusion of the A RBC unit. In the setting of recent ABO-mismatched transplant, his picture was consistent with hemolysis from newly formed anti-A by proliferation of donor lymphocytes, or PLS. We performed an emergent RBC exchange using O RBCs with a goal hematocrit of 24% while reducing the number of A RBCs in his circulation by approximately 70%. His pain improved rapidly thereafter, and he had complete recovery of renal function. Conclusion: PLS should be in the differential diagnosis when suspecting/ investigating clinically significant hemolysis in ABO-mismatched HPC transplant recipients, especially when the HPC source is from peripheral blood. As in our patient, it usually takes 7-14 days for antibodies to develop and they are short-lived (3-5 weeks). Due to the severity of his manifestations, we performed an emergent RBC exchange successfully. Furthermore, this patient's event exposed a vulnerability in our system of issuing the proper blood type for ABO-mismatched transplant recipients, which has since been remediated electronically Background/Case Studies: Group O RhD negative (ONEG) red blood cells (RBCs) are a precious resource. To conserve the ONEG inventory while minimizing the risk of RhD alloimmunization in ONEG females of childbearing age, transfusion services may automatically provide group O RhD positive (OPOS) RBCs to RhD negative males and/or RhD negative postmenopausal females during bleeding emergencies. Despite these conservation strategies, shortages of ONEG RBCs occur. The goal of this study was to determine how the utilization of ONEG RBCs can be optimized using agebased OPOS switching for routine transfusions in ONEG patients. Study Design/Methods: Recipient age and ABO/RhD group were obtained for all allogeneic RBC transfusions during the 2016 calendar year from 9 hospitals. An additional hospital* provided data for August-December 2016. RBC transfusions in patients <1 year of age, and in patients whose age and/ or ABO group were unknown, were excluded from analysis. The ABO/RhD group of each RBC unit was compared to that of the recipient to determine the number of ONEG RBCs transfused to all patients, the number of RBCs transfused to ONEG patients and the number of ONEG RBCs transfused to ONEG patients. The number of ONEG RBCs transfused specifically to ONEG patients >/5 70 years was also determined.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Our systematic reviews demonstrated a lack of recommendations amongst guidelines pertaining to transfusing single units of RBCs and only a few retrospective cohort studies to support benefits of the use of single unit transfusion strategies. Additional high quality studies are needed to identify the benefits of a single unit transfusion strategy and when it should be used. Guidelines groups should review research in this area to determine if a recommendation can be made. Background/Case Studies: Platelets made with platelet additive solution C (PAS C) and treated for Pathogen Reduction (PR) have been shown to have decreased post transfusion platelet counts from platelets stored in all plasma. With the advent of multiple types of platelets, we are evaluating whether a mixed platelet inventory has had an effect on component use. The literature from Europe has shown that platelet and red cell use does not increase when PR and PAS products are used. Evaluation of RBC use at our institution has shown no change in the number of products transfused per patient per month. We are evaluating whether the mixed inventory has led to more platelet transfusions. Study Design/Method: We looked at occasions when patients received all of their platelet transfusions on a single day. By doing this we were able to exclude refractory patients from the analysis. The information obtained from routine Quality Management audits of transfusions between December 2016 and February 2017 was used for this analysis. The information included the ordering service, product release time, product code, pre and post counts. Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab. Results/Finding: During the 3 months, 1723 units of platelets were transfused to 238 recipients. Over the 3 months, a median of 4 units was given to each patient with a range of 1 to 69. The overall distribution of products used was 58% plasma, 24% PR, 7% PAS F and 11% PAS C. Thirty percent of patients (N572) received all of their products on a single day. Single units were given to 54 patients while 14, 3 and 1 received 2, 3, and 4 units respectively. The distribution by product type was 56% plasma, 25% PR, 13% PAS C and 4% PAS F. This same percentage was present for single and multiple products and was not statistically significantly different from the overall distribution of the products given during the 3 month period (P5 1.00). The distribution by service was different for the groups receiving multiple units. For single units the distribution was 44% hematologic malignancy, 22% infusion clinic (NOS), 13% solid tumor medicine, 11% surgery, and 9% pediatrics. For those receiving multiple units the distribution was 50% surgery and 16% each for solid tumor, hematology and infusion (NOS). The chi-square test for associations showed the increase in multiple units to surgical patients to be significant with a P value of 0.022. Conclusion: The distribution of the type of platelets given during a single event of transfusion was not significantly different from the overall distribution of platelets given during the 3 month period. The patient's clinical service was a better predictor of the use of multiple products than the type of product given. This suggests that surgical losses or the need to have a higher platelet count during a procedure was the leading factor in the use of multiple products in this transfusion scenario.",

Somsen 2 , Maike E. van Hezel 2 , Marleen Straat 2 , Robin van Bruggen 1 and Nicole P Juffermans 2 . 1 Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, 2 Academic Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Anemia of Inflammation (AI) has a high prevalence in critically ill patients. In AI, iron metabolism is altered, as high levels of inflammation-induced hepcidin reduces the amount of iron that is available for erythropoiesis. AI is treated by red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. It is known that RBC transfusions increase iron level in neonates and thalassemia patients, but the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism during inflammatory processes is unknown. Since one unit of RBCs contains 220 mg of iron and 25% of the RBCs are cleared by macrophages within 1 hour following transfusion, RBC transfusion could increase iron levels and iron availability for erythropoiesis. We investigated the effect of RBC transfusion on iron metabolism in ICU patients, and additionally compared the effect in septic patients to non-septic patients. Study Design/Method: In a prospective cohort study in 52 ICU patients who received one RBC transfusion, different iron parameters were measured before and 24 hours after transfusion, to determine the effect of a RBC transfusion over a period of time. Next, the impact of a RBC transfusion on plasma iron parameters in septic patients compared to that in non-septic patients was analyzed. Plasma iron concentration, transferrin (saturation), ferritin, haptoglobin, hepcidin and IL-6 levels were determined. Results/Finding: In this cohort, serum iron levels were low and did not change following transfusion (4.1 vs. 4.3 mmol/L, p50.69). Also, the transfusion had no effect on transferrin saturation (12 vs. 13 %, p50.13), ferritin (531.0 vs. 599.0 mg/L, p50.74) and IL-6 levels (35.0 vs. 25.5 pg/ml, p50.09). Hepcidin levels increased in these ICU patients after RBC transfusion (223 vs 332 ng/ml, p50.01). In septic patients, RBC transfusion induced a decrease in haptoglobin levels compared to baseline, which did not occur in non-septic patients (-2.7 vs. 3.7 % change, p50.05). Other iron parameters did not differ between septic and non-septic patients. Conclusion: Transfusion of one unit of RBCs does not increase iron levels in ICU patients. The increase of hepcidin suggests RBC transfusion induced upregulation of hepcidin, despite the absence of a significant increase in IL-6 or plasma iron levels. This increase in hepcidin levels after transfusion can potentially further hamper iron availability for erythropoiesis. In sepsis, RBC transfusion decreases haptoglobin levels, suggestive of hemolysis. In conclusion, RBC transfusion might have a negative effect on erythropoiesis, due to the increase in hepcidin levels that are observed after transfusion.",

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Background/Case Studies: With the anticipated release of the FDA guidance: Bacterial Risk Control Strategies for Blood Collection Establishments and Transfusion Services to Enhance the Safety and Availability of Platelets for Transfusion, the use of pathogen reduced platelets (PR) which are often produced from products made with platelet additive solution (PAS) may become more common. Our institution has been transfusing platelets made with additive solutions since 2011 and pathogen reduced platelets have been available since 2016. In our data validating PAS and PR, the post counts from transfusion of PAS-C and PR products have been statistically lower than platelets in all plasma (PP) or PAS F products. Our study looks at whether this difference has led to a corresponding increase in the number of units of platelets transfused. Study Design/Method: The data was obtained from the routine quality reports produced for the blood utilization committee at our facility between 2012 and 2016. During this time PAS C, PAS F and PR went from 13% to 40% of all platelet products given. All recipients had an oncology diagnosis. The data collected included the service, unit number and product code. The number of unique recipients was determined monthly. The data was converted to PLT/month/recipient for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the two sample T-test Results/Finding: The data was normalized to PLT/recipient/month. In 2011 patients received an average of 5.41 units/recipient/month and in 2016 the average was 5.39 units/recipient/month. The intervening data points for 2013, 2014, and 2015 were 5.92, 5.66, and 5.92 respectively. The 5 year average was 5.66. The slope of the graph for all 5 points was y5 -0.004 15.672. The two sample T-test showed that the PLT/recipient/month from 2012 to 2016 was not statistically different with a P value of 0.81. Conclusion: The implementation of PAS and PR platelets in the oncology environment has not increased in the number of platelet transfusions given. In additional analysis, the red cell use has decreased (data not shown). This can be interpreted as indicating that patients have not had increased episodes of bleeding. Although the post platelet count from PAS/PR platelets may be lower, we do not have evidence from our platelet transfusion data that this is leading to clinical outcomes necessitating additional products to be given. Background/Case Studies: It is reported that the incidence of alloimmunization in AML patients is unrelated to the number of transfusions the patient receives and most patients who have HLA antibodies do not exhibit platelet refractoriness. Many cases are also found not to have any anti-platelet antibodies detectable by standard laboratory tests. Recent data in leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) recipients transfused exclusively with leukoreduced products show that 4% to 8% develop Alloimmune platelet refractoriness. Objective: To determine an improvement in platelet count with the match grade and/or the ABO blood group of the HLA matched platelets in highly alloimmunized patients with concomitant non-immune causes for platelet destruction. Study Design/Method: Clinically documented platelet refractory patients, who received HLA matched irradiated SDA platelets with their HLA typings for HLA-A/-B and HLA Antibody Identification were reviewed. There were two strategies utilized, the HLA strategy (matching recipient and donor HLA-A/ -B types) and the antibody specificity prediction (patient provided with platelets from donors lacking only those HLAs to which the patient had antibodies) strategy.",

The patient had no change in symptoms or vital signs during transfusion but post-transfusion hemoglobin was 5.9 g/dL. A transfusion reaction work-up was ordered. Post-transfusion serum sample was negative for hemolysis and no new antibodies were identified. The post-transfusion DAT was weakly positive only with complement and laboratory data revealed a decrease in total bilirubin (8.8 to 6.2 mg/dL). Two additional U variant, crossmatch compatible units were transfused over the next two days restoring her hemoglobin to 6.2 g/dL. The patient was discharged to home in stable condition and follow-up hemoglobin levels continued to rise back to baseline. Study Design/Methods: Molecular genotyping was used in donor unit selection prior to compatibility testing by transfusion services. Conventional methods were used to monitor the patient's condition pre and posttransfusion. Results/Findings: Each donor unit came from a different donor but all were the same GPB genotype as the patient. The patient did not experience an acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and genotype matching successfully facilitated donor unit selection in this case. Conclusion: Transfusion of U variant red cells to a U variant patient should be undertaken with great caution due to epitope and antibody heterogeneity. This case highlights the importance of genotype compatibility in selecting donor units for a chronically transfused, SCD patient with anti-U. Sound transfusion management of such patients requires planning and good communication on the part of clinicians and the laboratory staff. Background/Case Studies: Patients with decompensated WAIHA may require transfusion with red blood cell (RBC) products that are cross-match incompatible due free autoantibodies. The feasibility of blood transfusions in WAIHA patients is controversial because of difficulty in cross-matching and increased risk of transfusion reactions, since transfused RBCs may be destroyed more rapidly in patients with active hemolysis. To study the actual vs. theoretical risk of increased hemolysis in WAIHA patients, we investigated the post-transfusion (post-tfn) hematocrit (Hct) change in WAIHA patients who were transfused compatible RBCs compared to those who received LI blood. We further hypothesized that a post-tfn Hct would be inversely related to the degree of AHG-phase incompatibility. Study Design/Method: We reviewed all transfusions to patients in our quaternary-care hospital with a history of WAIHA from October 2015 to March 2017. Patient Hcts were ordered by prescribing physicians for clinical purposes. A transfusion episode was defined as all units released in the interval before a post-tfn CBC. AHG-phase crossmatch was tube tested in saline per clinical procedure. Transfusion medicine physicians determined the release of least-incompatible units. Statistical tests were performed with STATCALC (EpiInfo, CDC) and www.socscistatistics.com. Results/Finding: There were 139 RBC products transfused to 40 WAIHA patients. Twenty-three (57.5%) patients received at least 1 incompatible unit. The mean age was 51.4 years (range 4-93 yrs) with 50% women. Ethnic composition was 55% African-American, 40% Caucasian, and 5% patients of mixed/other ethnicity. One hundred fourteen (82%) of these products were released as LI products and 25 (18%) were compatible. Ninetythree (81.6%) of the LI product transfusions had a post-tfn Hct change of <3% whereas only 14 (56%) of the compatible product transfusions resulted in a post-tfn Hct change of <3% (p50.0092, v 2 (1), exact methods). The mean Hct increase in the compatible group was 1.83% per unit vs. a slightly lesser per-unit increase of 1.71% in the LI group (p50.82, t-test, 2-tailed) Within the LI group, there was no difference in the per-unit Hct change according to strength of incompatibility (Table) . Strength of AHG incompatibility was not available for 12 units. Units that were 31 incompatible had a lower mean post-tfn Hct rise compared to all other LI units (1.49% vs. 2.15%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (p50.38). Conclusion: The post-tfn Hct change for transfusions of LI units to patients with WAIHA was less than the expected 3% per unit more frequently than it was for WAIHA patients who received compatible products (81.6% vs. 56%). However, likely due to our small sample size, the mean differences were not statistically significant. Interestingly, there was no difference in the per-unit post-tfn Hct according to differing strengths of incompatibility in our sample, although the mean increase for the 31 LI products was less than all other LI products combined. The increase was unexpectedly low for weaklyincompatible units, which we are further studying. Future work includes consideration of inpatient vs. outpatient clinical status, effect of co-incident alloantibodies, comorbidities, and medications. transfusion management was summarised by individual hospital, type and total cases. In-hospital mortality (adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, bleeding context and number of RBCs in the first 4-hours from MT onset) was calculated with 95% and 99.8% control limits to indicate potential outliers. Data were analyzed using statistical software (Stata). Results/Finding: There were 5482 MT cases from 25 hospitals (17 tertiarylevel, 6 smaller/medium sized acute-care and 2 specialist women's). Number of MT cases per hospital ranged from 5 to 721. Patient median age was 65 years (IQR 49, 76), 62% were male and 73% required admission to intensive care. The most common clinical groups were cardiac surgery (21% cases), trauma (20%) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (13%); however there was marked variation between hospitals. Ratios of transfused products, analyzed according to bleeding context, varied between hospital types. The pooled average adjusted in-hospital mortality for the 17 tertiary-level hospitals was 21% (range 13% to 33%) and 16/17 (94%) were within the 95% control limit. CB that required !10 RBCs within 24-hours of MT onset occurred in 40% of cases. Comparison of transfusion management for this subset of MT cases showed that patients treated in smaller/medium sized acute-care were less likely to receive cryoprecipitate than patients treated in tertiary-level hospitals (67% versus 78%; p50.03). Conclusion: Patient characteristics and transfusion practice varied between hospitals and hospital types, however in-hospital mortality outcomes were comparable. Results are made available to participating hospitals in the ANZ-MTR to initiate discussion, practice review, and examination of compliance with national standards, patient blood management guidelines and to highlight areas for further investigation. Data are also available for review by governance and policy bodies at state and national level to support practice improvement activities and highlight priority areas for future research. Background/Case Studies: In hospitals and medical centers, in case of big traumas often an intraosseous entrance via a bone needle is combined with a fast flow fluid warmer. With this, infusion fluids, including blood products, are administered under pressure. This is done because veins of trauma patients are often not suitable for infusion of fluids. Suppliers of pump and needles describe the possible transfusion of blood products, but this is mainly limited to plasma and erythrocytes. There is no information available concerning transfusion of platelets under pressure via a bone needle. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of warming and administration of a platelet concentrate (PC) under pressure via a bone needle on the in vitro quality of platelets. Study Design/Method: Pools of 5 BCs and 280 mL of platelet additive solution III (PASIII) were used to produce PCs (n55). PCs were stored on a flatbed agitator (60 cycles/min) in a temperature-controlled cabinet at 22 6 28C for 4-7 days. To mimic hospital conditions, PCs were warmed using a blood warmer and transfused via a bone needle to a transfer bag. On the PCs a pressure of 300 mm Hg was applied. Using clamps, a flow velocity of 90-120 mL/minute was realized. Platelet quality before and after pressurized simulated transfusion was determined by means of various in vitro parameters. Results/Finding: Due to priming of the transfusion disposable with saline, the PCs were diluted 10-30%, resulting in a significantly increased PC volume and decreased platelet concentration after simulated transfusion. Because of loss of platelets in the disposable set, also the total number of platelets was decreased after simulated transfusion. After simulated transfusion, the PCs still fulfilled the requirements for platelet concentration (0.8-1.6x10 11 /L) and number (>250x10 9 /unit).",

Low inventories of AB plasma can cause a delay in life saving therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) procedures in AB patients needing plasma replacement. Here, 2 AB non-bleeding patients are presented who safely received AB and low titer A plasma for TPE. One AB patient who received AB plasma only was used as control to compare hemolysis laboratory data over TPE course. Study Design/Method: A retrospective review of TPE procedures for 3 patients was conducted from medical records. Number of procedures, volume replaced, total number of plasma units, number of A plasma units, quantity of A plasma and hemolysis laboratory data were recorded. Average quantity (ml) for A plasma and % of A plasma out of total volume of plasma used were calculated. All A plasma units were low anti-B titer units. In the laboratory, plasma dilution 1:50 is prepared and tested with reagent B cells. If agglutination is not observed, the unit is labeled as \"low titer anti-B\". Hemolysis laboratory data was traced with linear graphs and trends were compared between patient 1 and 2 and 3 (control). Results/Finding: All 3 patients were AB blood type. Patient 1, a 57 year old female with recurrent ADAMTS13 deficient TTP, received 2 courses of TPE (total 12 TPE procedures) for relapse and exacerbation. Ten out of 12 procedures were performed with AB and A plasma (average 916 ml of A plasma or 24% of total plasma volume for 10 TPE procedures). Patient 2, a 27 year old female with thrombocytopenia, schistocytes and presumed TTP, received a total of 12 TPE procedures. Four out of 12 procedures were performed with AB and A plasma (average 1210.5 ml of A plasma or 48% of total plasma volume for 4 TPE procedures). Patient 3, a 33 year old female with ADAMTS13 deficient TTP who served as a control, received a total of 10 procedures with AB plasma only. Haptoglobin, LDH, hemoglobin and total bilirubin were graphed and compared between 3 patients. The trends of hemolysis laboratory data for patient 1 and 2 were comparable with patient 3. All 3 patients had negative DAT. Only patient 3 received 2 RBC transfusions. All 3 patients had a favorable clinical outcome with TPE treatments and adequate platelet recovery. Conclusion: In this study, TPE was effectively performed without evidence of increased hemolysis using up to 48% of low titer A plasma. This approach can reduce strains on limited supplies of AB plasma while providing a vital treatment alternative for AB patients undergoing TPE who require plasma replacement.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Refractoriness to platelet (PLT) transfusion can be caused by antibodies (Abs) against Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I antigens (Ags) or less frequently against PLT specific Ags (PSAs). Glycoprotein IV (CD36) is one of the identified PLT surface Ags and deficiency is rare, but found in Asians (3-11%), sub-Saharan Africans (7-8%) and also in some people from Mediterranean descent. Two types of CD36 deficiency have been described. Type 1 deficiency is the complete lack of CD36 on both PLTs and monocyte-macrophages whereas type 2 deficiency lacks CD36 on PLTs with variable expression (12-99%) on monocytemacrophages. Transfusing PLTs in a patient with CD36 deficiency is challenging given the rarity of CD36 negative phenotype and risk of further immunization when giving Ag non-matched platelets. Study Design/Method: A patient with CD36 negative phenotype who received multiple PLT units was reviewed in the electronic medical record. Results/Finding: A 21 year old man developed aplastic anemia following liver injury possibly due to a supplement for body building and required multiple PLT and RBC transfusions. He received more than 20 units of apheresis PLT units over a 2 week period without any significant increase in PLT count. Cross-match compatible PLT unit found in 1 of 32 units and HLA matched units were tried without success. At that point, a CD36 Ab was identified in the serum and the patient's type 1 CD36 deficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry. His HLA class I Panel Reactive Ab (PRA) was 95% due to multiple PLT transfusions, although all Abs were low levels. The patient initially received high-dose prednisone and thymocyte immune globulin infusions without significant improvement in PLT increase. Following three doses of IVIG, he received a CD-36 negative (but blood type different and HLA 187A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 unmatched) PLT unit from his relative with only a slight increase in PLT count. However, he started to respond to CD36 non-tested apheresis PLTs after receiving a fourth IVIG and two rituximab infusions. Since then, he has received IVIG every 2 weeks. Other medications include filgrastim, eltrombopag, and cyclosporine for treatment of aplastic anemia. The mean corrected count increments (CCI) when post-transfusion PLT count was available are shown in Table. With desensitization therapy, his CD36 antibody positive reactivity in serial dilutions has reduced from 1:32 to 1:2 dilutions and his HLA Class I PRA has decreased to 37%. He is currently receiving 2 apheresis PLT units twice a week and RBC units periodically. His bone marrow (BM) has been slowly recovering evidenced by increased WBC count from zero to up to 1.0 K/mL and slow increase of reticulocyte counts. Current plan is RBC/PLT transfusion support until BM recovers or a haplo-identical transplant if BM recovery fails. Conclusion: We report a case with anti-CD36 Abs that received multiple PLT transfusions. This case demonstrates that decreasing Ab level with immunomodulation can be an alternative option for successful PLT transfusion when compatible PLTs are not available for patients with rare or multiple Abs to PLTs.

            "text": "Since an opt-out of this research test was originally offered, we report donor opt-out rates. Results/Findings: From Jan through Dec 2016, 101,854 blood donations were screened for B microti by Immunetics ELISA. Of those, 267 (0.26%) were positive. The percent of positive donations was evaluated monthly revealing a variable reaction rate between 0.08% and 0.42%. No patient Babesia transmission has been reported since implementing this test, but we only had 4 documented Babesia TTD cases from 2007-2017. Donors who previously tested negative demonstrated an increased seroconversion rate during the summer months, consistent with historical seasonal variation corresponding with tick season in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Test performance characteristics were analyzed by ABO group with no demonstrable differences in positive rates. The opt-out rate of donors who chose not to be tested significantly decreased over time, reflecting an increased acceptance of this test. Of 267 positive test results, 160 lookback investigations were initiated representing 59% of positive donations. Lookbacks were only performed when there was a donation within 12 months of the new positive screening test, according to IND protocol. No confirmatory testing was performed per IND protocol or for donor counseling, so the true positive rate is unknown. In the prior IND trial, up to 80% were unlikely to transmit infection in our region, i.e. were PCR and blood smear negative. Although a small number of antibody positive, PCR negative donors may be actively infected, no transfusion-transmitted Babesia infections were identified by lookback investigations. Notification of blood donors with positive screening results was also performed and information provided for healthcare provider followup. Overall, donor deferral represented 0.25% loss of eligible donors during this follow-up period. Deferred donors were invited to participate in other research collections not requiring volunteer donor eligibility. Conclusion: Testing for B microti may help improve blood safety, particularly in endemic regions. Although only 0.25% of donors have a positive reaction, this represents a significant loss of eligible donors over time, most of whom are unlikely to transmit infection. A direct test capable of detecting Babesia in individuals with very low levels of organisms without the need for concurrent antibody testing would be ideal. A reinstatement protocol for donors who test positive should also be considered. Nonetheless, the current method of screening is inexpensive compared to PCR-based methods. Background/Case Studies: Human anelloviruses are the smallest in particle size, smallest in genome size, and least complex in genetic organization of all human pathogens. They establish a chronic persistent infection in infancy or early childhood and produce a constantly detectable load in plasma thereafter. Some studies suggest they are ubiquitous, present in >90% of the human population, and that immune surveillance is required to control the level of the virus load. Study Design/Methods: We have developed a quantitative DNA PCR assay for the most conserved region of the Anellovirus genome that detects all known genotypes of the virus. We used this assay to examine viral loads in the plasma of US blood donors and transplant recipients pre-transplant and three months post-transplant. Results/Findings: For 53 blood donors, 51 were positive with an average load of 1.49x10 2 copies/mL of plasma, a median value of 80.5 copies/mL of plasma, ranging from 0 to 1.87x10 3 copies/mL. Pre-transplant viral loads were similar. For 41 transplant candidates, 40 were positive with an average of 3.70x10 2 copies/mL of plasma, a median value of 88 copies/mL of plasma, ranging from 0 to 1.18x10 5 copies/mL. Post-transplant viral loads were remarkably different. For 94 transplant recipients, all were positive with an average of 3.14x10 5 copies/mL of plasma, a median value of 1.25x10 5 copies/mL of plasma, ranging from 0 to 4.6x10 7 copies/mL. Conclusion: These results validate the PCR assay that was developed and confirm that detectable viral loads of around 100-200 copies were present in >90% of the blood donors surveyed. In addition, the effect of post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy has caused an increase in the viral load of at least 2 orders of magnitude above that of non-immunosuppressed individuals. Background/Case Studies: The screening of blood donors and travelers returning from endemic/epidemic areas has highlighted the importance of multiplex diagnostic approaches for the simultaneous analysis of various pathogens. Furthermore, in the context of similar clinical signs, the differential diagnosis of arboviruses during acute infection is essential to discriminate the causative agent for patient management and epidemiological surveillance. The development of a flexible diagnostic approach is a key challenge to face the continuing emergence of arboviruses, belonging to flavivirus and alphavirus, such as Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), Usutu virus (USUV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV).

Analytical performances of the test were evaluated on viral standards and on clinical samples: DENV (1/2/3/4), WNV, ZIKV and CHIKV. Forty human plasmas from blood donors with no history of contact with arboviruses were used as negative controls. We have designed two sets of degenerated primers for the generic RT-PCR amplification of all flaviviruses and for CHIKV. Biotinylated amplicons were captured on complementary grafted polythiolated probes on microplate. After addition of streptavidin-europium label, the molecular hybridization events were detected by time-resolved fluorescence using a microplate reader. Results/Finding: One original generic probe for DENV and specific probes designed for each of the four DENV serotype, WNV, the two ZIKV lineages and for CHIKV, were validated. The use of our methodology combining the amplification of the viral genomes and their identification using polythiolated probes shows 100% of specificity, with no false positive results on the 40 control samples, and no cross reactions.

Conclusion: This study represents a proof of concept that serological testing for B. microti by IFA in pools of up to 8 plasma or serum samples does not increase false positivity while maintaining the sensitivity of the test. Background/Case Studies: The rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelets is key to reducing the risk of infection in transfusion of blood components. The BacT/ALERT VIRTUO* is an advanced, next generation system with improved automation, connectivity and with data management systems. The VIRTUO's new algorithm significantly reduces the time to detection (TTD) of microorganisms during quality control testing of platelet preparations using BacT/ALERT (BTA) BPA (aerobic) and BPN (anaerobic) bottles. As plasma is known to be bactericidal, a study was completed to evaluate plasma susceptibility/resistance for organisms considered for VIRTUO studies. Study Design/Method: Human plasma (thawed and pooled) and saline controls were seeded with $100 CFU/mL of 12 organisms associated with platelet contamination and incubated at room temperature for 18-24 hours. Colony counts were performed initially and after incubation. Plasma resistance was determined if the colony count of the seeded plasma was equivalent or higher (1 1 Log) than the colony count of the seeded saline after incubation. Results/Finding: The serially diluted strains and all BioBall TM strains except P. aeruginosa, NCTC 12924, were determined to be plasma resistant. The BioBall TM P. aeruginosa was susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of human plasma, but when spiked into 4 mL of Leukocyte Reduced Apheresis Platelets (LRAP) and inoculated into BTA BPA bottles and loaded into the BTA 3D and VIRTUO the organism was recovered 100% .",

However, the BPA bottles still recover P. aeruginosa in the presence of LRAP. BPA/BPN bottles inoculated with select organisms from this panel in the presence of 4mL LRAP demonstrated 100% recovery when loaded onto the VIRTUO and 3D ( Table 1) . Further studies may be required to determine if higher test volumes of LRAP could affect the recovery of plasma sensitive strains. * VIRTUO is not FDA cleared for platelet testing A. notoscriptus, identified as a major urban vector of RRV, is also capable of transmitting Dengue virus 1-4, and has recently been found in Los Angeles, illustrating an expansion in range. With the growing geographical distribution of Aedes species mosquitoes, the potential for RRV to enter local transmission cycles outside of Australia is significant. In 2014, a probable transfusiontransmission (TT) was confirmed as the cause for an RRV infection in Australia, validating the reality that RRV TT can occur. RRV morbidity leads to clinical manifestations that are similar to CHIKV infection, with varying degrees of arthralgia, which can become debilitating. Various asymptomatic to symptomatic infection ratios have been reported, but this further increases the risk of additional TT in endemic areas and could mask the spread of the disease globally. Study Design/Method: Platelet concentrates (PC) prepared in PAS were inoculated with RRV, amotosalen was added to final concentration of 150 mM and the units were treated with UVA light. Pre-and post-treatment illumination samples were collected for titration. AS-5 RBC units were contaminated with RRV, mixed with processing solution/glutathione (GSH) and treated with amustaline at a final 200 mM concentration. Pre-and post-treatment samples were removed prior to amustaline treatment and 3hrs after amustaline addition, respectively, for titration by plaque assay on Vero76 cells. Log reduction was calculated as the difference between the mean infectious titer in pre-vs. post-treatment samples. Results/Finding: Inactivation of RRV was achieved to the limit of detection in PC and RBC. In PC, >5.1 log 10 or log 10 /mL of RRV was achieved, with >5.5 log 10 or >5.2 log 10 /mL of RRV inactivated in RBC.",

Background/Case Studies: The INTERCEPTV R Blood System for platelets is designed to inactivate pathogens and contaminating leukocytes. This photochemical treatment process utilizes amotosalen and low energy ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The current available sets include Small volume (SV; 255-325 mL), Large Volume (LV; 300-390 mL) and Dual Storage containers (DS; 300-420 mL) designed to treat platelet doses between 2.9 and 8.0x10 11 . The new Triple Storage (TS) set was designed to expand the dose range to 12.0x10 11 and the maximum volume to 650 mL, generating either 2 or 3 doses of pathogen reduced platelet components (PC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the system by performing log reduction assays using representative gram positive and negative bacteria and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in platelets suspended in PAS, or 100% plasma using TS Set. Study Design/Methods: For each experiment, a platelet pool was prepared either in 47% plasma/53% PAS or 100% plasma with a final volume of $650 mL and a dose of 9-12 3 10 11 platelets.

The presence viral particles in the blood of acute patients gives rise to concerns, especially in endemic areas. The high mortality rate, especially for critically ill patients, which often require blood transfusion, raises the need for a method to safely exclude MERS CoV contamination of blood products. Pathogen Reduction with Amotosalen/UVA technology is a widely established technology with a broad range of data supporting clinical efficacy and safety of Amotosalen/UVA treated blood products.

Pathogen reduced samples were taken preand post-pathogen reduction after various processing steps to assess the infectious titer by plaque assay titration and the genomic titer by real-time-PCR. Samples post pathogen reduction have been passaged 3 times up to 9 days, assessing the infectious titer and genomic titer every 3 rd day to exclude the presence of low-titer infectious particles. Results/Finding: All viral particles in the plasma units were completely inactivated with an average efficacy of !5.8 log infectious titer. No viral replication was observed after 9 days of passaging post inactivation. The genomic titer was only slightly affected by pathogen inactivation, which is designed to target the infectious titer, but not the physical titer. Conclusion: Amotosalen alone had a slight effect on the infectious titer while Amotosalen/UVA effectively inactivated all infectious MERS CoV viral particles in the plasma units with an inactivation efficacy above 5 logs infectious titer, giving evidence for improved blood safety of Amotosalen/UVA treated plasma in MERS CoV endemic regions.",

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of HCV infection in Taiwan. Study Design/Method: In Taiwan, anti-HCV (since 1992) and 8-sample mini-pools triplex nucleic acid test of HCV, HBV and HIV (since 2013) have been used in the routine blood screening. Prevalence of anti-HCV and HCV RNA were estimated in the first-time donors during 1999-2016 and 2013-2016, respectively. Age-standardized prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated with adjustment of WHO world standard population 2000-2025. For the incidence study, donors who have donated blood two or more times during 2013-2016 and who were without a history of anti-HCV positive before the follow-up period were included. The incidence and its 95% confidence interval was estimated from the number of new HCV RNA positive cases divided by the person-years of follow-up. Results/Finding: The crude prevalence of anti-HCV in the first-time donors was dramatically decreased from 15.2 per 1,000 donors (95% CI: 14.8-15.7) to 4.0 per 1,000 (95% CI: 3.7-4.3) during 1999-2016, and the agestandardized prevalence was also decreased from 27.0 per 1,000 donors (95% CI: 25.6-28.4) to 7.7 per 1,000 (95% CI: 6.9-8.5). The agestandardized prevalence of anti-HCV was generally higher in female donors before 2015, but it was significantly higher in male donors at 2016 (p-value50.03). A total of 1,036 HCV RNA positive cases, 1.9% of them were anti-HCV negative, identified from 579,286 first-time donors during 2013-2016, and the crude and age-standardized prevalence of HCV RNA was 1.8 per 1,000 (95% CI: 1.7-1.9) and 5.0 per 1,000 (95% CI: 4.3-5.7), respectively. Crude prevalence of HCV RNA was significantly higher in female donors (p value <0.0001), but no significant difference was found after age standardization (p value50.93). Both the prevalence of anti-HCV and HCV RNA were increased with age (p for trend<0.0001). In the incidence study, a total of 68 new HCV RNA positive cases, 23.5% of them were anti-HCV negative, found from 1,202,165 donors followed for 2,415,668 person-years. The incidence of HCV RNA was 2.8 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 2.2-3.5), and no significant difference was observed between both genders (p-value50.41) and between age groups (p for trend 0.37). Conclusion: The prevalence of HCV infection has been dramatically decreased by 71.5% during 1999-2013. It becomes significantly higher in male donors and that needs to monitor in the future. Incidence of HCV RNA is low in repeat blood donors and it needs to identify more incident cases to observe the epidemiological characteristics.",

Nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) technologies have the potential to detect viremia earlier than current screening methods, which are based on seroconversion. The primary benefit of NAT is the ability to reduce residual risk of infectious WP donations. The estimated reduction of the WP utilizing NAT for HCV is 70-12 days, HIV from 22 to 11 days, and HBV from 25-30 days. Study Design/Method: This cross sectional study was conducted in National blood Transfusion Center (Giza, Egypt) from 2012 to 2015, The total number of donor samples to be screened is 178685, The age of the donors ranged from 18 to 50 years, and they were of both sexes (M: F 5 3:1).Screening by NAT Ulterio assay (Grifols Diagnostics; formerly Novartis Diagnostics) was done in parallel with EIA testing for HBsAg, HCV-Ab and HIV Ag/ Ab. using individual donation NAT (ID-NAT). Multiplex NAT yield samples are further tested using the discriminatory assay in order to ascertain which viral nucleic acid is present in the donor sample. Statistical analysis Chi-square (v2) test was used to measure the association between two qualitative variables. Results/Finding: NAT screening detected a total of 75 NAT yield donations among 178685 (0.04%) seronegative donors. Among these 75 NAT yields cases, 53 (0.03%) were reactive for HBV, 20 (0.011%) were reactive for HCV and 2 (0.001%) were reactive for HIV-1. We stratified the age of the donors into 3 groups; group A (18 -28 years), group B (29 -39 years) and group C (40 -50 years). The prevalence of NAT yield to the three viruses was significantly higher in either group B or C, compared to group A (p 5 0.0089; with 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 0.0085 -0.0520 & p 5 0.0247; with 95% CI 5 0.0025 -0.0534 respectively).",

NAT HBV was significantly higher in males (p 5 0.002; with 95% CI5 0.0103 -0.0413), but the prevalence of either HCV or HIV did not differ significantly between males and females (p 5 0.3835; with 95% CI 5 -0.0077 -0.0145 & p 5 0.2751; with 95% CI 5 -0.0044 -0.0066; respectively). Conclusion: In this study The NAT yield of 75 in 178685 assumes more significance when one considers the fact that single donation is used for generating 3 components that can be used by 3 recipients. Hence, in effect the NAT yield becomes 3 times that is, 225 in 178685. Saving 225 recipients from TTI out of 178685 (0.13%) is indeed very significant. Results/Finding: Of the 303,569 donors who were tested by our donor center, 1,386 (0.460%) were repeat reactive. A seasonal pattern in the prevalence was observed with the highest number of donors being positive in summer, and then progressively declining during the fall and winter months and increasing again in spring. There was a single case of transfusion transmitted babesiosis reported from our center during this period. A patient who was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) from two donors in the beginning of July presented in August for further transfusion and was found to have parasitemia in the peripheral blood smear and was subsequently diagnosed with babesiosis. The donors were called back, however one of them could not be tracked. Samples were sent to the state for further testing: An Immunofluoresence assay was performed (combination of IgG, IgM and IgA). The test was positive at 1:128 titer. The screening ELIA S/CO of this donor was 0.2782. Both donors were indefinitely deferred as blood donors. Conclusion: Our data confirm a decreased risk in transfusion transmission with the use of a screening assay. Prior to implementation of the screening there were 6-10 transfusion transmitted babesia cases per year from 2008-2015 (Table 2 ). In the 11 months after implementation of pre-transfusion babesia screening, one break through case of transfusion transmitted babesia was observed (1 in 303,569 donors tested). Thus the babesia EIA screening test effectively prevents TTB. However, there was a substantial loss of donors due to being screen positive.",

With more convenient application of high through put sequencing, it becomes much easier to investigate uncultured microbiome in qualified blood donations. Therefore, metagenomics analyses were used to reveal emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in healthy donations which might potentially threat the blood safety. Study Design/Method: Pooled plasma sample were collected from 5,000 voluntary blood donors from Chongqing, China. Total DNA and RNA were extracted and amplified with random primers PCR respectively in order to construct a 250PE library to peform deep sequencing by Illumina Miseq. All reads were trimmed to remove low quality bases and adapter sequences. The fully overlapping paired-end reads passing the quality filter were concatenated using PEAR. We classified the final reads using Kraken and a Kraken database made from complete RefSeq bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes, along with the GRCh37 human genome. The unclassified reads by Kraken were aligned to NCBI nt database using BLASTn with cut-off Evalue as 1E -5 . The best alignment hits were used to classify the reads. Krona was used to generate all taxonomic distribution plots. Finally, the potential emerging and re-emerging infectious pathogens were identified out of the classified microbiome by experience. ABSTRACT Results/Finding: 1.23 GB raw data with 2,450,046 reads were generated in the DNA library. Meanwhile, 1.98GB raw data with 3,967,242 reads were generated in the RNA library. After cleaning the human background, 211 reads from bacteria, 98 reads from viruses, and 341 reads from parasites were identified (Table 1) . No hazardous viruses were identified as potential threats to blood safety. Except for viruses and bacterias which would do limited hazards to blood safety, plenty of parasites were identified in which some were already considered as threats to blood safety in some developed countries were also discovered such as Plasmodium sp. and Leishmania infantum (Table 1) . Conclusion: The investigation has revealed the metagenomics of the qualified blood donations in Chongqing, China. The results showed a thoughprovoking discovery of genomic fragments of some microbes which might threat the blood safety. The displayed serious results let us have to think about regulating some reasonable screening methods as well as donor recruitment strategy in certain epidemic areas or seasons to ensure the blood safety. However, on the contrary, the results should be considered more cautiously because the existing of genomic fragments could not represent the existing of infectious pathogens. The validity of the metagenomics hints were suggested to go through epidemiological investigations and specifically tested under laboratory ways such as bacteria or virus culturing to ensure the vitality of those pathogens.",

Background/Case Studies: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), an intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite, is accountable for nearly all malaria mortality in Africa. In 2015, WHO reported $212 million new cases worldwide, resulting in >400,000 deaths. Malaria prevalence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, home to 90% of all infections accounting for 92% of mortalities. Both the incidence and prevalence of malaria in Africa significantly increase the potential for transfusion-transmission (TT), with little to no screening of products in developing countries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inactivation of Pf in Whole Blood (WB) using a system specifically developed for the realities of the developing world and in support of the Swiss Red Cross Humanitarian Foundation for Whole Blood Pathogen Inactivation for Africa. The inability to consistently supply blood components leads to routine WB transfusion, and as transfusion-transmitted diseases are prevalent in the developing world, the establishment of a robust WB pathogen inactivation system is desirable. The approach uses the small molecule amustaline to form covalent adducts and crosslinks within nucleic acids of leukocytes and contaminating pathogens to prevent replication. The process includes addition of 0.2 mM amustaline and 2 mM glutathione (GSH) and a 24h at room temperature (RT) incubation after which the treated WB unit is suitable for storage up to 7 days at RT. Study Design/Method: For each experiment, a WB unit was spiked with ring-stage Pf-infected red blood cells (iRBC). A pre-treatment sample was removed prior to addition of amustaline and a post-treatment sample was removed 24h after amustaline addition to determine the pre-and posttreatment titers to calculate the level of inactivation. These samples were serially diluted in flasks containing medium with 5% fresh RBCs. The diluted samples were used to inoculate flasks in quadruplicate and monitored for parasitemia by counting iRBC in blood smears and by flow cytometry. Pretreatment cultures were terminated after reaching >1% parasitemia, while no residual Pf was detected in post-treatment cultures. Log reduction was calculated as the difference between the mean titer in pre-and posttreatment samples. Results/Finding: Robust inactivation of Pf in WB was achieved to the limit of detection, at >7.5 log 10 or >6.0 log 10 /mL. Conclusion: Pf was inactivated to the limit of detection in WB after treatment with amustaline/GSH, illustrating that the system has potential to mitigate the risk for Pf transfusion transmission in endemic regions that lack testing capacity and operate under the constraint of a very limited blood component supply and rely on WB transfusion.",

We aimed to determine the frequency of various genotypes of HBV and HCV in Canadian blood donors confirmed positive for HBV and HCV. Study Design/Methods: In 2011 the Roche multiplex assay (HCV/HIV/ HBV) was implemented in minipools of 6 units. HCV NAT was in place since 1999 (using minipools of 24) but this is the first time donors have been screened by HBV NAT. HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HCV were tested using the Abbott PRISM assay. Confirmatory testing for HBsAg was by the PRISM neutralization assay. Anti-HCV repeat reactivity was confirmed by the Inno-Lia HCV Score Line Immunoassay. Since March 2016 all samples testing HBV NAT positive, or confirmed positive for HBsAg and all HCV NAT positive or anti-HCV confirmed positive samples were considered positive and samples were sent to PHAC for sequencing. A sample from each positive donation was aliquoted and frozen at -20 o C. Genotyping was carried out by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the HBV surface antigen coding region. HCV viral RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse transcription and PCR amplification in the 5' NTR-E1 and NS5B regions. Sanger sequencing of these regions represents approximately 15% of the genome. Results/Findings: All confirmed positive donations were whole blood donations. There were 42 HBV positive donations. Of these, 37 had tested HBV NAT positive. Genotypes were 8 type A, 6 B, 4 C, 17 D and 2 E. There were 5 samples HBV NAT negative but HBsAg positive (2 were anti-HBc reactive). Of these, 4 could not be sequenced and one was genotype A (also anti-HBc reactive). There were 30 samples considered HCV positive. Of these, 17 samples were HCV NAT positive. Genotypes were 5 type 1a, 3 1b, 3 2c, 2 2b and 4 3a. There were also 13 samples HCV NAT negative but anti-HCV positive. None of these could be sequenced. Conclusion: The first 8 months of molecular surveillance show a range of genotypes for HBV and HCV for samples identified as NAT positive. To date no samples that were NAT negative anti-HCV reactive could be sequenced, however one NAT negative sample that was positive for HBsAg and anti-HBc reactive was HBV genotype A. Surveillance over a longer period is Background/Case Studies: The BacT/ALERT 3D Microbial Detection System (BTA 3D) is currently FDA cleared for the quality control testing of Leukocyte Reduced Apheresis Platelets (LRAPs). The BacT/ALERT VIRTUO Microbial Detection System (VIRTUO) (bioM erieux, St. Louis, MO) is a new generation of BacT/ALERT instrumentation. The underlying colorimetric technology used in previous generations of BacT/ALERT is used in the VIR-TUO and incorporates new instrument architecture to improve temperature stability, workflow improvement via automation of processes that are currently performed manually, an improved user interface and an enhanced algorithm to shorten time to detection. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the VIRTUO and BacT/ALERT 3D (BTA 3D) instruments, using BacT/ALERT BPA (aerobic) and BacT/ALERT BPN (anaerobic) bottles, for the detection of a range of typical bacterial contaminants seeded into leukocyte reduced apheresis platelets (LRAPs).* Study Design/Method: The study was performed at two institutions, one in the US and the other in the UK. Aliquots of LRAPs were seeded with low levels (1-20 cfu/mL) of 11 bacterial species commonly associated with platelet contamination, and 20 replicates (10 per instrument) of 4 mL aliquots per bottle were inoculated into BPA and BPN bottles. One set of bottles was loaded into BTA 3D and the other into VIRTUO and incubated until signaled positive by the instruments or for up to 7 days. Overall detection rates and time to detection of bacterial contaminants between instruments were compared. Additionally 98 bottles were tested in each instrument (LRAPs only, no organism) to evaluate differences in the overall negative agreement rates (detection of false positives) between instruments and to serve as sterility controls for the platelet preparations. Background/Case Studies: The implementation of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) blood screening is still a challenge in resource-limited countries. At the same time, in these countries, higher to similar proportions of replacement to voluntary blood donors are recruited. A higher prevalence of infections is observed in relation to developed countries. As a consequence, more incident cases of infections can be expected. In our country, some hospital blood banks could not afford NAT due to high costs, but belong to a net that centralizes NAT in a reference Blood Center. The process to consolidate small blood banks in Regional Blood Centers, which will be able to implement NAT, is not yet complete. Although efforts to reduce replacement /familiar blood donations are in progress, these goals have not been completely achieved. The aims were to compare the prevalence of HIV, HCV and HBV by NAT screening in a blood center recruiting only voluntary blood donors with the prevalence in centers recruiting replacement and voluntary blood donors, and describe the NAT yield rates for HIV, HCV and HBV in a period of three and a half year experience. Study Design/Method: A Regional Blood Donor Center (RBDC) has centralized NAT screening from centers in different regions of the country due to since August 2013. This process required to achieve adequate laboratory conditions and staff qualification and a development of software to assure sample traceability and interface for transmission of results. When a window period was suspected, the NAT screening was repeated from the plasma unit and a second sample of the blood donor was required to confirm NAT results. This RBDC have also been developed a 100% Voluntary Donor Program since 2011 and is the only center in the country that has achieved this goal. Results/Findings: A total of 264,343blood donations were studied from August 2013 to December 2016. In the RBDC, where only voluntary blood donations are recruited, the prevalence was 18 per 100,000 donations for HIV (IC95% 8-34:100,000); 14 per 100,000 for HBV (IC95% 7-29:100,000) and 18 per 100,000 for HCV (IC95% 8-34:100,000). In all other centers together, where voluntary and replacement blood donations are recruited, the prevalence was 89 per 100,000 donations for HIV (IC95% 77-103:100,000); 70 per 100,000 for HBV (IC95% 59-83:100,000) and 78 per 100,000 for HCV (IC95% 66-91:100,000). Window period infections were detected only in centers recruiting voluntary and replacement blood donations, giving NAT yield rates of 1: 66,086 for HBV; 1: 132,172 for HIV and 1: 264,343 for HCV. Conclusion: The HIV, HBV and HCV prevalence was lower in a center where the tasks to sustain a Voluntary Blood Donor program were developed. NAT yield rates could be reduced in the region if this program could completely be applied in all centers. Mechanisms leading to OBI include various factors such as imperfect host's immune response and viral variation factors. This study was to determine the viral loads of OBI under currently recruitment and screening among blood donors in five Blood services of Zhejiang Province, China. Study Design/Method: Before donation, the donors were screened and precluded with HBsAg preliminary test positive and ALT level abnormal. Following, the samples were detected for HBsAg twice using different ELISA reagents and HBV DNA using TMA or QT-PCR techniques. Then, the samples with HBV DNA positive and ELISA negative were tested for the viral loads using TaqMan technique in COBAS S201 system. HBV S region was also sequenced. Results/Finding: 234 OBI were found in the 230,000 donations. In the viral loads assay, 43 samples were negative and 104 samples' viral loads were lower 20IU/ml. The mean viral loads was 1.85 6 0.41 (log10) IU/ml in other 87 samples,while the mean viral loads with HBsAg1/HBV DNA1 samples was 2.38 6 0.83 (log10) IU/ml. 60 samples of OBIs have analyzed the HBV genotype, which B was the most prevalent subtype (69.0%) and the other was HBV C genotype(31.0%). Compared the samples with HBsAg1/HBV DNA1 ,We found two OBI samples carrying with 318T>C mutation, which could cause an amino acid S55F. Conclusion: In this study, the viral loads of OBI infection in donors was much low than HBsAg1/HBV DNA1, and some unique variation was identified in the OBI individuals. 195A TRANSFUSION in general population. Screening of blood donors for HBV in India is primarily based upon detection of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in donor's sera. The current study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) in voluntary blood donors and to analyze the burden of HBV window period donations. Study Design/Method: This is a prospective, observational, mono-centric study performed in a national accreditation board for hospitals (NABH) accredited apex blood bank, located in Maharashtra state, India. Monolisa HBsAg ULTRA (Bio-Rad, France)sandwich type ELISA using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was used for HBsAg detection in donor's sera. All the ELISA non-reactive samples were also tested by an additional real time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPX-PCR) by cobasV R TaqScreen MPX test. The donors which were found to be positive for HBV DNA were followed upat 15 th days, 1month, 3 months& 6 months by Monolisa HBsAg ULTRA (Bio-Rad, France) to analyze interval of window period and to delineate the window period donations (WPD) & true OBI. Background/Case Studies: Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is characterized by hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA-positive, but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) -negative. Since May 2015, we have been testing apheresis donors for HBV nucleic acids and improvements in laboratory testing have reduced the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. The number of apheresis collections increased significantly year by year, however, data on hepatitis B virus marker rates among these donors continue to be lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the epidemic characteristics, incidence and estimate the risk factors of OBI among apheresis donors in a region of central China. Study Design/Method: Apheresis donors' data from May 2015 to Dec 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. All samples were tested for HBsAg, HBV DNA, and other markers. Nucleic acids testing (NAT) was performed on the Roche cobas s201 platform using pools of 6 serologically negative samples and any pools positive would undergo NAT again individually. HBsAg negative, but HBV DNA positive were further tested for HBV DNA quantitative PCR, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to hepatitis B e (HBeAb). Results/Finding: In the evaluation, 68547 seronegative donations were screened by NAT and a total of 20 HBV DNA-reactive/HBsAg-negative donors were detected. No HIV RNA -reactive or HCV RNA -reactive sample was detected. Complete serologic screening of the index donations indicated that the majority of these donors had an occult HBV infection and the majority of which were married men and the fixed donors with many whole blood or apheresis donations. Age distribution of the age group 31-55 years old showed a large proportion, who accounted for 80% of reported infections. Most of the HBV DNA cases (about 80.0%) reached senior high school education. The average HBsAg DNA positive rate was 0.029% (20/ 68547). Incidence among apheresis donors in this period for HBsAg DNA were 2.91/10000. These estimates were comparable to those among repeat whole blood donors. We developed pathogen reduced (PR) cryo derived from FFP and PF24 with 5 day stability at 228C. Study Design/Method: Six replicates of type-matched pools of whole blood derived (WBD) and Apheresis (Aph) plasma were split to produce conventional control (225 610 mL) and test components (625 mL 625 mL). Test components were PR with amotosalen and UVA light. Aph and WBD FFP were produced by freezing plasma within 8 hr and WBD PF24 within 24 hr. Cryo was manufactured according to site SOPs and frozen at -308C (Test 62 6 2 mL, Control 22 6 2 mL ). Test and Control Cryos were thawed at 378C, and characterized immediately post thaw (t50), and after 5 d storage at 228C and tested for FB and FVIII function, thromboelastography (ROTEM) and thrombin generation (CAT).",

KG Background/Case Studies: The parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is the cause of Chagas disease which is endemic to the Americas and infects 6-8 million people. In order to prevent transfusion mediated transmission of this parasite in endemic countries, blood collection centers require high throughput anti-T. cruzi assays with good specificity and sensitivity. In nonendemic countries, selective testing of at risk donors is a strategy to avoid temporary donor deferrals. In addition, continued pressures on laboratory operations demand that assays perform on platforms capable of increased walk away time and enhanced automation in areas of reagent management, retest options, and commodity/waste management. Study Design/Method: The performance of the new automated chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to T. cruzi was evaluated on the Alinity s automated platform and compared to another onmarket chemiluminescent immunoassay. Precision was assessed over 20 days using a panel of positive and negative samples. Sensitivity was evaluated on 407 presumed antibody positive specimens and specificity was evaluated on 7621 random blood donor samples. Results/Finding: Precision was 7% CV or less for positive samples over 20 days. The overall specificity in a blood donor population was 99.99% (7620/ 7621). Sensitivity was 100.00% for 407 presumed antibody positive samples. Conclusion: These results indicated that the new automated Alinity s Chagas assay provided very good performance in sensitivity and specificity, comparable to the current on-market anti-T. cruzi assay, and is equally suitable for use of universal screening in endemic and selective donor screening in non-endemic countries.",

Sensitive HBsAg assays must be capable of coping with a wide range of mutants while exhibiting an uncompromised specificity. In addition, continued pressures on laboratory operations demand that assays perform on platforms capable of increased walk away time and enhanced automation in areas of reagent management, retest options, and commodity/waste management. Study Design/Method: The performance of a new automated chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection and confirmation of HBsAg was evaluated on a next generation automated platform, Abbott Alinity s. Precision was assessed over 20 days. Sensitivity was evaluated using 511 known positive samples, 30 commercially available seroconversion panels, the WHO standard, 23 HBsAg mutants, and 94 HBsAg genotyped specimens (A through H). Specificity was evaluated on random blood and plasmapheresis donors.",

Negative (NEG), indeterminate (IND) and positive (POS) blot results were grouped by S/CO ranges as follows: 1-4.99, 5-9.99, >10. Band detection and intensity were independently analyzed for indeterminate and positive results. Results/Finding: Immunoblot results were negative in 57.9% (224/387) of samples, indeterminate in 30.7% (119/387) and were positive in 11.4% (44/ 387). A direct relationship was observed between positive immunoblot and increased S/CO. The proportion of IND results were higher in the S/CO group 5-9.99 (63.2%) compared with the 1-4.99 (29.9%). In samples with indeterminate results, NS3_2 was the most frequent band detected (52,9%). In contrast, the most frequent band in the group of positive results was CORE (93,2%). Only one sample from the indeterminate group (0.8%) had a strong band intensity (31), compared with 10 samples from the positive group (22.7%). Conclusion: The proportion of indeterminate immunoblot results in this sample of Colombian donors is one of the highest ever reported, being twice as much as the proportion found in larger samples of US donors. The high proportion of IND results found in the S/CO group (5-9.99) suggests that the optimal S/CO ratio for predicting a confirmed anti-HCV result in this population should be higher than the one recommended by the CDC for US population (>5). Overall, these results suggest that the supplemental testing algorithm for blood donations in Colombia could be improved not only by using high S/CO ratios as an alternative to immunoblot, but also by introducing HCV genomic assays instead of immunoblots, at least for samples with intermediate S/CO ratios. NS3_1 and NS3_2 cross-reactivity in Colombian population warrants further investigation.",

While NAT provides improved sensitivity and detection of HCV in the pre-seroconversion window, serological testing provides continued detection of HCV in infected individuals and individuals with resolved infections with no detectable HCV RNA. Blood and plasma centers require very high throughput anti-HCV assays with high specificity and sensitivity to prevent unnecessary donor deferrals while maintaining the safety of the blood and plasma supply. In addition, continued pressures on laboratory operations demand that assays perform on platforms capable of increased walk away time and enhanced automation in areas of reagent management, retest options, and commodity/waste management. Study Design/Method: The performance of a new automated chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to HCV was evaluated on the Alinity s System. Precision was assessed over 20 days evaluating positive samples. Sensitivity was evaluated using 501 preselected positive samples and 30 seroconversion panels. Specificity was evaluated on samples obtained from 8,113 blood and plasmapheresis donors from the United States and Europe and 200 diagnostic samples obtained from the United States. Sensitivity and specificity samples were split across 3 reagent lots during testing. Confirmation of repeatedly reactive samples was done using a testing algorithm consisting of the INNO-LIA TM HCV Score and NAT/HCV Discriminatory NAT assays. Results/Finding: Imprecision was less than 7.0% CV for positive samples over 20 days. Overall clinical sensitivity was 100% on 501 preselected anti-HCV positive samples. Seroconversion sensitivity was better than the comparator as evidenced by the new Anti-HCV assay identifying 5 more bleeds than the comparator assay. The specificity was 99.99% (8,111/8,112) for blood donor specimens and 98. 98% (194/196) Background/Case Studies: ZIKA virus (ZIKV), which has been outbroken in South America and the United States since middle of 2015, was declared as the public health emergency of international concern by WHO in Feb 2016. In addition to mosquito, ZIKV can be transmitted via maternalneonatal relationship, sexual intercourse or blood transfusion. The potential for transfusion-transmitted Zika virus was shown in French Polynesia where 2.8% of asymptomatic blood donors tested were positive for Zika virus RNA using nucleic acid test (NAT). Several case reports have confirmed that ZIKV can be transmitted by transfusion. It has been shown that among blood donors, 73.8% of the ZIKV infections were asymptomatic and the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic patients observed in Micronesia was approximately 1:5 to 1:6. Thus ZIKV has raised a great challenge to transfusion safety. Measures should be taken to prevent transfusion-transmitted ZIKV, including temporary deferral of blood donors in epidemic locations, donor self-reporting of ZIKV symptoms after donation with or without quarantine of blood components, supply by blood collected from non-endemic areas to epidemic regions, NAT of blood donations, and pathogen inactivation of blood products. In this study, we evaluated ZIKV inactivation in plasma by using methylene blue photochemical treatment (MBPT). Study Design/Methods: Plasma units from randomly selected healthy donors were collected and spiked with ZIKV. Samples were added by MB at a final concentration of 1lM and assayed after illumination with visible light from both sides for 5, 15, and 30min. Viral infectivity and ZIKV RNA loads (reverse transcription PCR) were measured in spiked plasma before and after MBPT and confirmed using repetitive passages in cell culture. Control was ZIKV spiked plasma without photochemical treatment. Results/Findings: ZIKV titer of control sample was 4.5 log 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/mL. No viral infectivity was detected after MB photochemical inactivation treatment for 5min, 15min or 30min and the losses of the infectivity were further demonstrated by 3 repetitive passages of cell culture. Meanwhile, ZIKV RNA loads decreased significantly during the initial 5min of treatment whereby Ct-value jumped from 18.25 (control) to 25.50 (MBPT for 5min) (Table 1) . Conclusion: It showed that MB photochemical treatment could effectively inactivate ZIKV in plasma. RNA lesions were induced during MBPT process so that nucleic acid reverse transcription and amplification were inhibited. MBPT is proved to be an efficient method to prevent plasma transfusiontransmitted ZIKV infections.",

Study Design/Method: Donors were informed about the study in the predonation reading materials. Linked samples from approximately 50,000 Canadian whole blood donors including 30,000 from Canadian Blood Services (CBS) and 20,000 from H ema-Qu ebec (HQ) were collected. Clinics were selected to ensure representative sampling of the donor population. All 199A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 donations with available plasma samples were tested by individual donation NAT at the American Red Cross laboratory in Gaithersburg, MD, using the cobas V R HEV test (95% LOD 18.6 IU/mL, 95% CI 15.9-25.6) for use on the cobas V R 6800/8800 System. This test is not currently approved in Canada or the USA, but is available as a CE marked test. All NAT-reactive donors are questioned concerning risk factors for recent HEV infection (travel, animal contact, food and water exposure), undergo confirmatory testing (alternate NAT, viral load, genotyping and IgM/IgG serology), are notified by letter, and deferred from donating for 6 months; in-date products collected from the donor, and any frozen red blood cells or plasma from the previous 6 months are destroyed. Recipients will be traced in the event of any products transfused in the previous 6 months. Results/Finding: As of April 10, 2017, 9 of 39,834 (19,395 CBS, 20,439 HQ) tested samples with valid results have been found HEV-NAT reactive: 8 donors have been confirmed by further testing to date. Confirmation is pending in 1 donor. Of the 9 donors, 7 were from Quebec, and one each from Nova Scotia and Alberta (7 male, 2 female). Ages ranged from 21 to 70 years. Only two donors reported non-specific symptoms (fatigue). In terms of risk factors: 6 ate pork (including 3 who ate pork liver), 4 ate shellfish, 2 ate venison, and 3 drank well water. One donor had no identifiable risk factor. Viral loads ranged from 3 to 151 IU/mL, of which 2 were <10, 3 were 10-50, and 3 were >50 IU/mL; 2 were anti-HEV IgM positive and 4 anti-HEV IgG positive at index (Wantai assay). Conclusion: The prevalence rate of acute HEV infection in this donor population appears to be around 1/4400. The data from this study will contribute to the ongoing risk assessment of transfusion-transmitted HEV infection in Canada.",

Most importantly, the VIRTUO's new algorithm significantly reduces the time to detection (TTD) of microorganisms during quality control testing of platelet preparations using BacT/ALERT BPA (aerobic) and BPN (anaerobic) bottles. BPA and BPN bottles were tested on VIRTUO and BacT/ ALERT 3D (BTA 3D) to evaluate repeatability to detect growth in seeded Leukocyte Reduced Apheresis Platelets (LRAP) without Platelet additive Solution (PAS), throughout platelet shelf life (3, 4 and 5 days after collection). Study Design/Method: Pooled LRAP were seeded with low levels of 6 organisms commonly associated with platelet contamination at 3, 4 and 5 days post collection. The seeded LRAP were inoculated into BPA and BPN bottles on 10 different days (not consecutive) alternating between 2 teams of 2 people each. Seeded bottles were loaded into a VIRTUO and a BTA 3D and incubated until declared positive or negative (up to 7 days). Additionally, BPA and BPN bottles inoculated with 4 mL of unseeded LRAP were tested on the VIRTUO and the BTA 3D (120 and 40 bottles respectively), to serve as negative controls, sterility controls, and to evaluate the risk of false positives caused by LRAP Results/Finding: The repeatability of the VIRTUO to detect organisms in LRAP was demonstrated by a recovery rate of seeded bottles of 99.9% for the VIRTUO and 99.5% for the BTA 3D. The VIRTUO demonstrated an average improved TTD of 3.2 hours, when compared to the BTA 3D in the presence of 4 mL LRAP platelets. The LRAP did not cause false positives. Additionally, the age of the LRAP units (within 5 day expiry),did not impact the TTD when seeded with organism Background/Case Studies: Zika Virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus that is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and sometimes A. albopictus mosquito. Most infections are asymptomatic. ZIKV Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) became a required test for blood donors per the FDA Guidance entitled, \"Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Zika Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Components\". Based on our geographical location, implementation of this testing began 12 weeks after this guidance was issued. We performed ZIKV NAT for donors of whole blood and blood components under an Investigational New Drug (IND) Study (sponsored by Hologic, Inc.). We performed a retrospective analysis on all NAT results as there is a potential to defer donation due to false positive screening results. Study Design/Method: Donors that consented to donate blood and be tested for the ZIKV were obtained from three Blood Banks in Colorado and Nebraska. NAT was performed using the Procleix Virus assay which is a qualitative in vitro nucleic acid assay system that detects ZIKV RNA in plasma specimens. The assay was performed on the automated Procleix Panther system. All testing was performed according to the manufacturer package insert. Results/Findings: In the event of a Reactive result, donors would be retested by NAT in addition to other testing (IgM antibody testing, neutralization test). Donors are deferred for 120 days barring continued ZIKV testing and NonReactive results. A total of 2,485 donors were screened for ZIKV. All donors screened for ZIKV were NonReactive by NAT.",

The rapidly increasing number of infections in Brazil, with hundreds of fatalities since December 2016, is of concern. YFV is a Flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and could spread, like Zika virus, to other parts of the Americas where the vector is endemic. With no effective antivirals and only supportive therapy available, the best mitigation strategy is through vaccination with live attenuated vaccine strains, like the 17D-YFV strain. YFV vaccine is considered an effective and safe vaccine; however major adverse events have been reported including neurologic and visceral adverse effects. In addition, transfusion transmission (TT) of live attenuated YFV has been reported with severe clinical outcomes, especially in immunosuppressed patients. In order to prevent TT by YFV vaccine strain, the AABB recommends a 2 weekperiod deferral after YFV vaccination. YFV outbreaks and vaccination campaigns may therefore reduce blood availability. This pilot study evaluated the ability to inactivate 17D-YFV using amotosalen (S-59) and UVA light PRT of platelet components (PC). Study Design/Method: PC in 65%PAS (n53) or 100% plasma (n51) were spiked with high titers of 17D-YFV and treated with S-59/UVA PRT. Samples were taken pre-and post-UVA illumination and infectious titers were determined, by plaque assay using Vero76 cells. The extent of inactivation was quantified by comparing titers before and after inactivation. Results/Finding: Pre-PRT infectious titers were 4.71 6 0.7 Log 10 PFU/mL for PC in 65% plasma and 5.19 Log 10 PFU/mL for PC in 100% plasma while titers in post-PRT samples were <-0.7 6 0.0 Log 10 PFU/mL for PC in 65% plasma and <-0.7 Log 10 PFU/mL for PC in 100% plasma. Inactivation to the limit of detection of >5.41 6 0.7 Log 10 or inactivation of >4.71 6 0.7 Log 10 PFU/mL was achieved for PC in 65% plasma. Inactivation to the limit of Background/Case Studies: The use of biotin as a supplement has increased in recent years and many health care professionals may not be aware of the high dosage intake by their patients. This high dosage has resulted in an increased prevalence of individuals being exposed to biotin levels much greater than the recommended daily dose and as a consequence, has led to inaccurate lab results for assays that utilize the free capture biotin-streptavidin methodology. Although Abbott's Alinity s assays do not utilize this free capture biotin-streptavidin methodology, eight assays developed for blood screening on the Alinity s system were evaluated for biotin interference to ensure there are no unknown consequences of high biotin levels.",

Background/Case Studies: Bacterial contamination of platelets is the highest residual infectious risk in transfusion despite the current preventive strategies. While bacterial contamination may affect any blood component, the ambient storage temperature conditions for platelets make them most likely to facilitate bacterial growth. Based on all the precautionary measures, the final platelet concentrates include in the worst cases a very limited viable bacteria number estimated from 10 to 100 colony forming units (CFUs)/bag (i.e. 0.03 to 0.3 CFU/mL). One major difference between viruses and bacteria is that bacteria have the ability to grow up to a concentration of 10 8 -10 9 CFU/mL over the 5 days product shelf-life. Moreover, a large diversity of strains is found in contaminated platelets representing a key challenge for the development of a generic bacterial test. The aim of this study was to develop an economic and easy diagnostic approach for the early, rapid, sensitive and generic detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates. The adaptability of the process with the blood transfusion services requirements was of major concern. Hence, attention was focused on an easy to automate technique able to deliver results on Day 2 after collection. Study Design/Method: A large panel of bacteria involved in transfusion reactions including clinical isolates and reference strains was established and used for mouse immunizations, antibody screening and platelet spiking steps. An original approach was used to produce and select monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria to develop our generic immunoassay. As recommended, 24 hours (Day 1) after collection a sampling volume of spiked platelets (0.1-1 CFU/ml) was tested after a short generic culture, lysis and capture of bacteria on magnetic microparticles in a microplate format. An immunoassay was performed for the detection of the captured bacteria. Results/Finding: This approach was tested on a panel of 25 bacterial strains involved in transfusion reactions. The pre-analytical steps and the capture of bacteria on microparticles were improved to avoid false negative results and to enhance the sensitivity of detection.

Results/Finding: TBSF is a private nationwide single blood services program in Taiwan, and performs Anti-HCV screening test and NAT confirmatory test on every collected blood, which is a large-scale population screening of HCV in Taiwan because of its high blood donation rate (7.5%). TBSF confirmed positive test result of repeated blood donors, and can identify HCV RNA seroconversion cases as recently-infected hepatitis patients. Those infected patients would be referred to physician for further medical care and deferred permanently by TBSF to secure blood safety. By interviewing the newly-infected cases, the risk factors of HCV patients can be studied and then help identifying and eliminating sources of HCV infection. TBSF also contribute to health education by teaching our donors being aware of potential risks of HCV infection and keep monitoring every parameters of HCV epidemiology to evaluate the efficacy of HCV eradication program. Conclusion: In HCV eradication program, TBSF can not only secure blood safety but also participate in health education, disease screening, etiology finding and prevention, surveillance and evaluation. Thus, among all stakeholders, TBSF is particularly important and can play a pivotal role in eradicating HCV by 2030 in Taiwan.",

M\u20ac uller 1 and Axel Seltsam* 1 . 1 German Red Cross Blood Service NSTOB, 2 Maco Pharma International, GMBH Background/Case Studies: The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system (Macopharma) is a UVC-based pathogen inactivation system for platelet concentrates (PCs). Inactivation efficiency has been shown for a broad range of viruses, bacteria, and protozoans. Previous studies with the first set of bacteria species of the WHO International Repository of Platelet Transfusion Relevant Bacterial Reference Strains revealed a high inactivation capacity for clinically relevant bacteria. Aim of the current study was to investigate the bacteria inactivation efficacy of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system for Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis which have recently been added to the WHO International Repository. Study Design/Method: PCs were produced from 5 buffy coats using the additive solution SSP1 (MacoPharma) with a residual plasma content of 35%. For inactivation kinetics, PCs (n53) were spiked with bacteria to a final concentration of approx.10 6 colony forming units (CFU)/mL and irradiated with increasing doses until the full UVC dose was achieved. Samples were taken for the bacterial titer determination after each irradiation step. For sterilization studies, two PCs were pooled and inoculated with bacteria to a final concentration of approximately 0.3 CFU/mL. Bacteria were allowed to grow for 6 h in the PCs at 22 6 28C under agitation. After splitting, one PC remained untreated (growth control) while the other one was UVC-treated. After storage for seven days, samples were taken from both bags for sterility testing by BacTALERT (Biomerieux) and for determination of the bacterial titer in the untreated control units. Results/Finding: Bacteria in PCs were inactivated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment using the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system. Mean log 10 reduction factors ranged from 6 to 7 for Enterobacter cloacae (6.3 6 0.6, PEI-B-P-43), Pseudomonas fluorescens (7.1 6 0.4, PEI-B-P-77), Staphylococcus aureus (6.6 6 0.4, PEI-B-P-63), and Streptococcus bovis (7.0 6 0.3, PEI-B-P-61).",

National Blood Bank Service Background/Case Studies: blood and its components are life saving; however, they are also associated with life threatening hazards such as transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs). Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis are the most serious infections transmitted during blood transfusion. Serious of blood shortages especially in developing countries and reliance on unsafe family replacement or paid donors also contribute to an increased risk of TTIs. Knowing the current prevalence of TTIs among blood donors will be crucial in donor program strategy development and cost effective alternative strategies of blood screening are highly required especially in resource limited setup. Study Design/Method: A retrospective analysis of blood donors' record covering the period from July 1, 2008 to July 30, 2013 was conducted. The data was collected from the Nation al Blood Bank (NBB) center Donor Data base. In addition, direct laboratory costs of parallel versus sequential strategy of blood screening were compared using the current price of the laboratory costs. Data was first exported to SPSS version 16 software for analysis. Data analysis was performed using scores and odds ratio using same software to look for an association between dependent and independent variables. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results/Finding: A total of 173, 207 consecutive blood donors were screened between 2008 and 2013. The overall seroprevalence rate of HBV, HIV, HCV and syphilis of blood donors was 5.0%, 1.6%, 1.4% and 0.1% respectively. The HIV-HBV co-infection was higher among blood donors 135(41.79%) followed by HBV-HCV co-infection whish accounts about 103(31.89%). Significantly increased sero-prevalence of TTIs was observed in among Family replacement donors, factory workers, daily labors and the age group of 26-35. In this study the difference in cost between the current in use strategy (parallel) versus the newly proposed designed sequential testing algorism was 746,773.9 Ethiopian Birr. Conclusion: A significant percentage of the blood donors harbor TTIs. The NBB center should work on voluntary blood donor mobilization and develop culture of voluntarism. The direct laboratory cost analysis using current in use strategy (parallel) was higher than the newly designed sequential testing algorithm. Thus, the new strategy can be implemented to make screening of TTIs cost effective in NBB center.",

OneBlood Background/Case Studies: An 81 y.o. male patient was admitted to the Emergency Room for severe acute gastrointestinal bleeding, caused by an arterio-venous malformation later located in the proximal jejunum that was clipped endoscopically. During this admission, he received a total of 13 units of Red Blood Cells. Approximately 4 weeks later, he was re-admitted due to another episode of GI bleed manifested by melena. As part of his routine evaluation, a CBC was performed in which a blood smear revealed the presence of intraerythrocytic parasites consistent with Babesia sp. Study Design/Method: Upon notification of a suspected case of Transfusion-Transmitted Babesiosis, lookback of all donors involved in prior transfusion event was initiated. Results/Finding: To confirm the presumptive diagnosis of babesiosis, PCR was performed and Babesia microti DNA was detected. An evaluation of the patient's risk factors revealed that prior to the GI bleed episode for which he received transfusions, eight months earlier he was also transfused during open heart surgery. No travel history to the US Midwest, and while he travelled to New England two years ago he did not spend time outdoors. He was splenectomized in his mid 20's. Donor lookback identified a donor who lived in New London County, Connecticut but spent the winter season in Central Florida, where the blood donation (double RBC collected by apheresis) took place. He had never been diagnosed with babesiosis, but participated regularly in outdoor activities in Connecticut that put him at risk for tick bites (although he never noticed being bitten or showing signs of it). Upon testing, he was found to be negative for B. microti on PCR as well as IgM antibodies, but had IgG antibody titers of 1:256. The recipient of the other RBC unit collected in the same donation was deceased within hours of transfusion, so no follow up could be performed. During phone interviews, none of the remaining donors had risk factors for babesiosis, and all but four were tested and found serologically negative. Conclusion: While transmission of babesiosis through the zoonotic route is confined to regions were the appropriate hosts and vector coexist, people from areas where it is endemic may establish temporary residency and donate blood in non-endemic locations facilitating transmission through transfusion as illustrated in this case. Once licensed assays for Babesia microti become available, testing schemes will have to be formulated through policies that take this issue into consideration.",

Background/Case Studies: Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections (TTBI) are rare, but serious complications of blood product transfusions. From 2011-2015, 8% of 173 transfusion-associated fatalities reported to the FDA were attributed to bacterial contamination. Red cell units are rarely implicated in severe and fatal TTBI. When present, contaminants are often gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteria with psychrophilic properties. We present a case of a sickle cell patient who developed definitive sepsis after receiving a red cell unit contaminated with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia). Study Design/Methods: A 27-year-old female with sickle cell disease was admitted to the hospital for possible pain crises. Pre-transfusion blood and urine cultures collected on Day 1 of hospitalization showed no growth after five days. On Day 3, the patient required a blood transfusion for which she was issued a CMV-safe, irradiated, HbS-negative, crossmatched, O-negative red cell unit. The 318 mL unit had been aliquoted via sterile connecting device 12 days prior for a pediatric patient. All 26 mL of the pediatric aliquot were transfused without adverse effects. The patient's pretransfusion temperature was 37.18C. Within 45 minutes of starting the transfusion, the patient's temperature increased to 39.38C and subsequently reached a maximum of 39.58C. The transfusion was stopped and the blood bank notified immediately. Gram stain of the remainder of the transfused component revealed GNR bacteria. Blood was collected from the patient for culture and antibiotic treatment initiated. Results/Findings: Initial transfusion reaction work-up revealed no evidence of clerical errors with negative post-transfusion antibody screen and direct antiglobulin test. Blood cultures from both the patient post-transfusion and the implicated red cell unit grew GNR bacteria identified as S. maltophilia. Further microbial testing revealed the cultured pathogen was able to proliferate at 4-68C; a finding not characteristically observed in S. maltophilia. Conclusion: This is the first definitive case of TTBI with S. maltophilia. This bacterium is a globally emerging GNR that is widely spread in the environment, causing both community-acquired and nosocomial infections in immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Contamination was unlikely due to an asymptomatic donor. There was laboratory evidence of the pathogen in both the transfusion recipient and the transfused component. The patient was not infected with the pathogen prior to transfusion, and no other potential exposures could be identified. The patient recovered following appropriate antibiotic treatment, but endured prolonged hospitalization. The transfusion reaction was classified as definitive, severe TTI of definite imputability.",

Study Design/Method: A lower calculated cutoff value for the ABBOTT PRISM HBsAg and HIV O Plus assays was determined by calculating the mean signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) plus 3 standard deviations of four different types of plasma production pool samples. The calculated cutoff values were utilized for the rest of the validation. The detection limit was determined by testing in triplicate, serial dilutions of WHO HBsAg and HIV antibody standards diluted in plasma. A normalized detection limit was calculated for the HBsAg assay using production pools containing low, typical and high anti-HBsAg titers. Intra-assay variability was determined by testing a minimum of 6 determinations of a low positive control in 1 run. Inter-assay variability was determined by testing at least 3 representative negative production pool samples, at least 1 low positive sample (about 3 S/CO) and a titration series of WHO standard spiked into plasma production samples. Runs were performed on six separate days using two different instruments and two different lots of assay reagents. Results/Finding: The lower calculated cutoff values for the HBsAg and anti-HIV assays were both below the manufacturer cutoffs of 1.00 and were 0.72 and 0.48 respectively. The HBsAg assay detection limit was 0.065 IU/ mL for source plasma and 0.120 IU/mL for recovered plasma samples. The normalized detection limit study demonstrated that one and a half hours was the maximum amount of time the pool samples could sit at 15-25 0 C where all samples were still reactive for HBsAg. The anti-HIV lowest positive dilution for all replicates varied between 1:10,000 to 1: 1,250,000 depending on subtype and group. The % CV of the S/CO values of the replicates of the intra-assay variability validation were less than 5% for both assays. The %CV of the S/CO values of the panel of samples of the inter-assay variability validation were less than 14%. Conclusion: A lower calculated cutoff value could be determined for commercially available immunoassays for HBsAg and anti-HIV. These immunoassays could meet all of the recommendations in EMA validation guidelines. The ABBOTT PRISM HBsAg and HIV O Plus assays can be utilized to test production pool samples. was performed on 6 donors (3-17 days after the index donation) -3 donors in the follow up study and 3 tested by the DOH. No donors tested by the DOH participated in the follow up study. Follow up testing was negative for all 6 donors. DENV antibodies were negative in 9 donations and equivocal in 1. Our initial reactive rate is higher than that reported to date for the Procleix ZIKV TMA of 1 per 23, 342 [P. Williamson, et al Transfusion, in press] . Conclusion: Universal testing under IND was successfully implemented and incorporated into blood center operations. We have noted an initial reactive Other demographics that should be analyzed for their potential to be used to predict CMV seroconversion rate include gender, age, race, ethnicity or a combination of these.",

The internal audit function was centralized in late 2011, for which the program consisted of 2 types of audits, an operational compliance audit and a support systems compliance audit. Each type was performed twice per year at each main center. This model was no longer serving the changing organization. Study Design/Methods: Lean Six Sigma concepts were applied to this project. Survey results and brainstorming aided in capturing the strengths of the current program, opportunities for improvement, and ideas for a redesigned program. This information was the primary input to the SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) for the purpose of understanding performance of the current program, as well as elements that could impact the future design.

Background/Case Studies: In many places, blood banking is using semiautomated systems to perform fractioning in different blood components (red blood cells, platelets and plasma). Banc de Sang i Teixits (BST), adopted the fully automated Reveos system (Terumo BCT Inc, Lakewood, CO) few years ago to manufacture blood components. In June 2016, BST started a validation of new blood bags manufactured by Terumo BCT with different variables on platelet volume after processing and a kit to perform platelets pools with a new filter. Study Design/Method: To perform this validation, 300 blood donations were used under different conditions (see Table below ). The current filter evaluated for the platelet pool (LRF-XL, Haemonetics Corporation) was compared to a new filter (Terumo BCT Inc.). The new blood bags were manufactured using a new vinyl supplier. A portion of these processed blood components (red blood cells, platelets and plasma) was used for different quality control (QC) tests (routine QC performed at BST following European Directorate for Quality of Medicines & Healthcare; cytokine analysis, such as P-Selectin and platelets recovery through the filter).",

Regarding the new platelets pooling kits, a better manipulation by the operator was observed; although the tubing is shorter and it meant being more difficult when manipulating the pools. No issues should be found if they are implemented in routine use. It's planned to start this implementation during this year, 2017; so then there will be larger results in order to have a proper procedure qualification. Conclusion: Patients requiring rare blood products are rare, and those lacking high prevalence antigens are the most challenging for whom to obtain antigen negative blood. It is clear that some requests for exquisitely rare types are not able to be filled with current donors. Molecular testing of large numbers of donors has likely helped to identify more rare donors in recent years. It is recognized that commercial platforms do not include many of these making these rare types even more challenging to find. Consideration should be given to testing more donors of all ethnicities to identify more rare donors.

For this analysis, the focus was on 16-18 year olds and premenopausal women (ages 19-55) donors. On average, 16-18 year olds donate 1.3 times a year and premenopausal women donate 1.49 times a year. If both of these groups were limited to donating once a year, a total of 4,845 donations from 16-18 year olds and 9,272 donations from premenopausal donors would not be collected. Conclusion: After analyzing the impact of the AABB Association Bulletin #17-02, the bulletin will have a significant impact on both donors and our local blood supply. More than half of donors would receive either ferritin testing or iron supplementation. If the only measure employed is limiting the number of times a donor could donate for 16-18 year olds and premenopausal women, this recommendation would have a substantial impact on our ability to provide blood products to local hospitals. Background/Case Studies: Transfusion medicine knowledge deficits are apparent among medical students, residents and practicing physicians. These deficiencies may be due to the frequency and type of education. The majority of medical students in the United States receive four or fewer hours of transfusion medicine education. The Transfusion Medicine Academic Award Group published educational content guidelines for medical school, residency and fellowships. However, the frequency and educational methods remain poorly evaluated and with little guidance. We investigated the effects of different educational techniques on transfusion medicine knowledge acquisition in novice learners. Study Design/Method: Three educational pathways were developed to teach principles of transfusion medicine while allowing learners to recognize problems and develop solutions for transfusion medicine complications. The simulation group received all educational activities within a 2.5 hour inperson, high-fidelity live session. The hybrid group received some educational component online and also attended an in-person high-fidelity simulation session. The online only group received all educational materials online, including a pre-recorded-video simulation session. The learners were second year medical students enrolled at one institution. The same faculty members taught all live sessions and developed all online materials ensuring the content was the same. A pre-and post-test was created to address blood groups, blood donation, blood testing, blood component indications and transfusion complications. The educational session was evaluated by the Likert scale survey which ranges from zero (poor/unsatisfactory) to five (outstanding). Results/Finding: 97% (101/104) of the simulation group students improved their post-test scores and had an average Likert scale rating of 4.1 (very good). 89% (63/71) of hybrid group students improved their post-test scores and had an average Likert scale rating of 4.2 (very good). 89% (90/101) of online only students improved their post-test scores and had an average Likert scale rating of 3.0 (good). The average changes in scores were statistically significant within all training groups (p value < 0.0001). Additionally, the simulation group had a larger increase in average post-test scores when compared to the online only group (p<0.0001) and the hybrid group (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that a faculty taught high-fidelity transfusion medicine simulation curriculum consisting of an in-person didactic session and simulation session for second year medical students produces greater knowledge acquisition compared to an online only or hybrid curriculum. The high-fidelity simulation curriculum is also preferred over the online only education as indicated by the Likert survey results.",

University of Texas Medical Branch Background/Case Studies: Diagnostic management teams (DMTs) are an innovative way to bridge the communication gap between the laboratory and clinical services thereby facilitating the delivery of improved patient care. DMTs employ a multidisciplinary approach which integrates clinical and laboratory data into succinct interpretations and recommendations. The interpretations must be of moderate to high complexity in order to be clinically valuable. Recommendations are made regarding future testing, timing of testing prior to blood component needs, and other pertinent concerns to allow for improved coordination of patient care. The timeliness of the DMT reporting is vital to patient management. The inherent design of a DMT also provides an educational opportunity for trainees at academic centers. Study Design/Method: The transfusion medicine service at a large university-based academic medical center implemented a DMT in 2016. All cases involving complex antibody identification workups, transfusion reactions, deviations from standard operating procedures, consultations for blood component utilization, and massive transfusion protocols from July 2016 through January 2017 were evaluated by transfusion medicine residents. The electronic medical record (EMR) of each patient was also reviewed to determine relevant clinical history. All significant findings were presented at the Transfusion Medicine DMT conferences. The DMT was comprised of physicians from Transfusion Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Anesthesiology, Transfusion Service technical staff as well as visiting clinical staff from Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Transplant Services, and Pediatrics. The DMT integrated the clinical and laboratory data to formulate relevant interpretations and recommendations. The final DMT reports were placed into the EMR for access by health care providers. Financial benefits of a transfusion medicine DMT were also evaluated. Results/Finding: In a 7-month period, 504 cases of complex antibody identification workups (65%), transfusion reactions (2%), consultations for blood component utilization (6%), and deviations from standard operating procedures and massive transfusion protocols (27%) were presented at the Transfusion Medicine DMT conferences. The placement of DMT narratives in the EMR as progress notes and laboratory reports provided informative and timely communications. Residents participating in DMTs demonstrated improved clinical and laboratory correlation skills. As a result, resident competency in transfusion medicine was enhanced. Over $68,000 of revenue was generated utilizing the standard professional component CPT codes. Conclusion: DMTs encompassing multiple aspects of transfusion medicine improved patient care through enhanced communication between laboratory and clinical services. Additional benefits of a DMT program include resident, clinician, and technical staff education and the generation of revenue for the institution.",

Tsang* 1 , David Lancaster 2 , Dianne Geary 2 , Robert Scott 1 , Anh Thu Nguyen 1 , Adam Garcia 2 , Raina Shankar 1 , Leslie Buchanan 1 and Tho Pham 2 . 1 Stanford Health Care, 2 Stanford Blood Center Background/Case Studies: Inventory management is both a major challenge and an integral part of hospital transfusion service (HTS) and blood centers (BC) operations. The current process at our institution involves twice-per-day shipments from the BC to the HTS, with each shipment predicated upon current stock levels at HTS. Manually obtaining inventory levels for each product is time-consuming. The manual determination is also errorprone. We aim to enhance inventory management operations by developing an informatics solution to (1) streamline the ordering process to accurately reflect inventory status and transfusion practices and (2) re-allocate valuable HTS tech time. Study Design/Method: At our HTS, the general inventory accounts for over 50 product categories broken down by component, blood type, irradiated status, and CMV-serology status. We therefore sought to establish an electronic method to reliably infer the general inventory level. Since the raw electronic inventory report comprised both the general inventory and physically sequestered units (e.g. special antigen units, cross-matched units), over a 5-month calibration period we performed linear regression between electronic and the gold-standard manual count to impute from the electronic census the number of units of each product category in the general inventory. Once we had a reliable electronic method to determine inventory levels, we implemented a 3-month pilot period. We analyzed various metrics pre and post pilot implementation to ensure non-inferiority of our electronic system: (1) the ratio of units transfused per week to the number stocked (T:S), (2) the number of products ordered as STAT, and (3) the number of expired products. We created in-house programs on Visual Basic for Applications (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for both the calibration and pilot periods. 2486 lines of code were written for both programs, including 2 class modules and 34 distinct subroutines. Results/Finding: During the pilot period, we investigated our system's noninferiority. The average weekly T:S ratio for cryoprecipitate, plasma, and RBC, respectively, were 1.03, 1.21, and 1.48 before the pilot period compared with 0.88, 1.17, and 1.40 during the pilot period. These differences did not reach statistical significance (p50.28). We also monitored the number of stat ordered products before and during the pilot period, which were 27 and 31 stat units per week, respectively (p50.86). Lastly, we also monitored the number of monthly wasted products due to expiration as an indicator of inventory mismanagement before and during the pilot period, which were 226 and 196 units, respectively (p 5 0.28). An estimated 7 hours per week of technologist time was reallocated to other tasks once the electronic census was adopted. This translates to 0.175 FTE and $18,200 per year saved from labor costs per year if permanently adopted. Conclusion: We created an in-house electronic ordering system to enhance information fidelity, re-allocate technologist time, and further standardize ordering. Our system showed non-inferiority to the labor-intensive manual system, by not changing the number of stat orders, having the same T:S ratio, and not increasing the number of expired products. This is achieved while freeing up over 360 hours of staff time per year. Future directions include full automation with involvement from HTS informatics department.",

There was further collaboration with other organizations such as the provincial health quality division, Choosing Wisely After the launch, an informal survey indicated that 74 of the province's 158 hospitals were interested or had already adopted portions of the PTQIP. To further assist hospitals in advancing their QIPs, a technologist prospective screening educational module was developed in addition to an electronic tracking tool with which hospitals can enter their baseline data and subsequent audit data and track their success. Both hospital and provincial reports can be generated from the tracking tool. A more formal survey conducted in 2017 indicated that 93% plan to implement or already have implemented the PTQIP and 43% of the respondents already have put prospective order screening by technologists in place. Conclusion: Helping hospitals through the development of standardized templates, instructions, education and other tools for transfusion quality improvement increases the ability of hospitals to uptake quality improvement initiatives. Taking a standardized approach across the province allows for both aggregate and hospital data comparison analyses. Background/Case Studies: Military and civilian trauma-based studies have demonstrated the advantages of transfusing blood products prior to a patient's hospital arrival, a process known as Pre-Hospital Transfusion (PHT). Helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) worldwide have implemented this protocol with great success, despite a current lack of guidance or advisory publications. There is a need for literature that addresses the regulatory requirements and logistical challenges associated with developing a PHT program. Herein, we report our experience as a large hospital system embarking on the development of a multi-state PHT service. Study Design/Method: In October 2016 a work group was formed to establish PHT services for the HEMS providing care to over thirty regional hospitals. Composed of flight care staff, emergency physicians and transfusion medicine specialists, the group identified the major tasks to be addressed: Federal/State Regulations; Inventory Structure/Management; Product Storage/Testing; Tracking/Traceability; Emergency Release Protocol; and Staff Training. While there are no specific regulations governing PHT, the regulations pertaining to blood product storage, validation, and monitoring apply. The FDA, AABB, and state agencies were each consulted to ensure compliance with all directives.",

The blood inventory at each site was designed to contain: group O positive RBCs, group A low anti-B titer liquid plasma, and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate. A military-tested in-flight medical record system will be used to transfer transfusion information to non-affiliated hospitals as needed. Validated inflight coolers, protocol for product emergency release, inventory tracking system, and re-stocking schedule were also requisite to this plan. Staff competencies regarding emergency release guidelines, transfusion reactions, and the handling/storage of products are maintained by the HEMS medical director with additional oversight provided by transfusion medicine physicians.

In these countries, the health systems have been weakened or destroyed and health workers provide health services under difficult circumstances. Humanitarian emergencies increase the demand for blood transfusion and make its delivery challenging and complex. Despite these obvious needs, across the Region, there is a lack of information on the emergency preparedness and response capacity of blood transfusion and on the challenges countries and health responder's face in meeting the needs of the patients during emergencies. Study Design/Method: We searched PubMed and Index Medicus for the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region for data on availability and safety of blood transfusion in humanitarian emergencies. We conducted a structured survey of blood transfusion services (BTS) in all countries in the Region to identify the following: type of humanitarian emergencies between 2006 and 2016; current strategies to ensure availability and safety of blood transfusion during emergencies; coordination and collaboration between countries; and gaps and challenges. Additional information was collected during a regional consultation (Eastern Mediterranean Region) held in May 2016 in Tunisia. Results/Finding: We found 24 publications on disaster from five countries in the Region and 16 publications on disaster preparedness and blood transfusion in casualties and severe trauma outside the Region. However, none dealt with the questions of availability and safety of blood transfusion during emergencies. Twelve countries (54.5%) responded to the survey. Armed conflicts and terrorism are the commonest types of emergencies with estimated 10-85% of the injured requiring blood transfusion. Nine countries have emergency preparedness and response plans for BTS. Potential blood donors are mobilized through public calls, besides a direct appeal on regular and replacement donors. Seven of the responding countries keep an emergency blood stock. Collaboration between the different stakeholders exists in seven countries. Lack of adequate and competent human resource, transport and cold chain deficits, shortages in supply of consumables and maintenance of equipment, lack of reliable power supply, and shortage in finances are the gaps identified. Conclusion: There is a need to integrate BTS in the overall national emergency preparedness and response, collect and disseminate updated information on factors affecting provision of blood transfusion in humanitarian emergencies, provide technical and financial assistance to affected countries, strengthen mechanisms for coordination and collaboration among different parties, and develop a regional emergency blood services system and management expertise. (63, 85, and 108 for 2014-2016) . The number of collections per registered TRT donor varied significantly, ranging from 0 to 12 therapeutic draws/donor per year. Excluding those that didn't present for a therapeutic blood collection, the average number of TRT collections/donor per year decreased from 3.8 to 2.8 between 2014 and 2016. Conclusion: Our blood center has experienced an increasing number of therapeutic phlebotomies, as well as individuals on TRT referred for therapeutic phlebotomy due to elevated hemoglobin values from 2014 through 2016. It is not clear from information provided by the ordering physician whether this is intended as a temporary measure to decrease the hemoglobin while the patient is on TRT, or whether the dose was being adjusted or discontinued due to the known risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with polycythemia; however, the average number of donations per TRT donor decreased during this timeframe. The percentage of men on testosterone who present as regular blood donors at our blood center is not known, since this hormone is not reason for deferral. Our findings raise the concern, however, that regular phlebotomy is necessary to reduce the risk of testosterone-associated polycythemia in this population. As it is our duty to provide a safe and adequate blood supply, our blood center also has concerns about perpetuating the misperception that repeat phlebotomy, particularly if required more frequently than 56 days, is sufficient to mitigate the risks of testosterone therapy. Hence, we have made the decision to discontinue offering phlebotomy services to this population of donors other than for those on testosterone that meet all donor eligibility requirements.",

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: Venipuncture is a critical step in blood collection and locating a suitable vein for this procedure can be a challenge. Unacceptable vein selection or incorrect needle placement can lead to incomplete collection or infiltration. In a blood donor center, the primary selection of a vein is done by palpation within the antecubital area. Prior to needle insertion, the skin at the site must be prepared and contact avoided until after needle is placed. Vein illuminator (VI) devices are available to aid in visual display of potentially suitable veins. Such a device was made available to staff in March of 2010. After an initial testing and instructional period, the VI has since not been used by staff. The objective of this study is to discover reasons why staff does not use the VI to identify potentially suitable veins. Study Design/Method: A staff survey was developed and distributed to staff in March 2017 to inquire about usage of the VI and obtain feedback about the device. At the time that the survey was sent, the device had been available for several years. The survey included questions involving frequency of use, adequacy of training, comfort with using the device, knowledge of the device's storage location, willingness try the device, and general feedback. Results/Finding: The survey had a 77% response rate (n533). Of these, 78.8% have never or very rarely utilized the VI. Self-reported reasons for low utilization focused on two dominant themes. First, that the device is not needed and second that it doesn't accurately show veins. 87.9% of respondents are aware of where the VI is stored and a more accessible location to share the device was not identified. Although 93.9% of respondents have been provided training on using the VI, the group was mixed regarding their comfort level in using the device independently. Only 48% of the group was willing to try VI. Conclusion: Infiltration and incomplete collection account for approximate 3% (770 units/year) of qualified blood donors, yet VI does not appear to be a viable solution for our blood donor program. There seems to be both an opportunity and challenge with VI implementation. The opportunity is to create critical awareness of problems with vein cannulation. The challenge is to identify a device that is more effective at visualizing deeper veins necessary for blood donation.",

This decreased kit cost by $19.21 each providing an estimated annual savings of $239,000. Conclusion: With the multiple Alyx donation types we were able to increase our collection of right type procedures by approximately 2.5% and decrease our kit costs by 22%. With Alyx the collection plasma on mobile blood drives is now possible. Due to ease of use, operators have embraced this technology and we have consistently met our monthly collection goals from October 2016-March 2017. Background/Case Studies: High frequency of donation is a risk factor for iron deficiency. Because females' iron stores are generally lower than males' before they start their donation career, females who donate frequently are particularly high risk. Minimum hemoglobin (Hb) has long been the same for males and females at 125g/L, but for males this falls below the normal limit. As a first step to mitigate iron deficiency, criteria for whole blood donors were modified for males (minimum Hb increased to ! 130 g/L) and for females (minimum interdonation interval increased from 56 to 84 days). The longer interdonation interval in females was gradually implemented, starting with donor messaging in October 2016, changes in rebooking of donation appointments in December 2016 and culminating with eProgesa criteria changes on March 5, 2017. Both these changes are expected to initially result in donation loss, but may be partly counteracted by a decrease in Hb deferral rates in female donors. We aimed to assess the impact of these changes on Hb deferral rates. Study Design/Method: Percentages of Hb deferrals were calculated as the number of donation attempts that resulted in Hb deferral divided by the number of successful donations plus Hb deferrals multiplied by 100. Percentages were calculated for male and female donors before and after changes were made.",

Hb deferral rates for female donors were 12.6% in September, 12.0 % in October/November, and 9.9 % from December to March, 2017. Conclusion: Hb deferral was more frequent in male donors after the minimum Hb was increased to 130 g/L. The gradual implementation of increased interdonation interval for females resulted in a reduction in deferrals, thus the initial donation loss associated with this change may be partly offset over time by decreased Hb deferrals. A longer observation period is necessary to confirm these findings and assess impact on phenotyped blood and donor retention. In the past 8 years, 59,223 blood products, derived from 10,509 procedures, were distributed to 185 different investigators in over 200 laboratories. Whole blood was the most common product (45.2%), followed by unmanipulated mononuclear cell collections (28.6%), and elutriated monocytes or lymphocytes (19.8%). Less common requests included platelets (2.5%), plasma (2.5%) and granulocytes (0.8%). Adverse donor reactions were infrequent (0.33% of procedures).

The objective of this study was to determine the optimal collection settings to enable 100% collection of pathogen reduced platelets while limiting the loss of products. Study Design/Methods: The collection instrument evaluated for this study has FDA approval for platelets suspended in 100% plasma. The corresponding pathogen reduction system used for the study has 3 kits with 3 different collection specifications. All apheresis collections occurred at a fixed site and pre-platelet counts were performed on a hematology analyzer. The yield scale factor has been established for correlation between the hematology analyzer and apheresis collection device. In order to determine the optimal collection targets, the apheresis collection instrument had a variety of multiple yields and volumes established for collections. Staff was instructed to collect the highest available yield per donor. After collection, volume, platelet yield, and concentration data was obtained. This data was used to determine if the product met the specifications for one of the available kits, and if the actual platelet yield was higher than 6.8 x10 11 , thus meeting the criteria for a double product.",

ABSTRACT Conclusion: The loss of both triple platelet products and lowered postprocessing platelet recovery requires the collection of platelets to be far more precise. The goal of platelet collection has shifted from simply maximizing each platelet collection to an approach that considers optimal collection within the limits of kit specifications.

Effective timing of interventions during apheresis donations in particular should hold the key to predicting VVR, but no research has been done on the topic. Study Design/Methods: This study investigated the potential to predict VVR from fluctuations in peripheral blood flow measured by laser Doppler flowmetry in platelet apheresis donors, a population highly likely to experience VVR. Data were collected from 354 individuals who donated platelets during the 6-month period between February and August 2015, and data from the 30 donors who experienced VVR were analyzed. To calculate the level for issuing VVR alert, the percent decrease in blood flow (DBF) and the percent decrease in heart rate (DHR) were calculated, the time from alert to VVR was estimated for three DBF levels, and the detection performance of each alert level was calculated. Results/Findings: Eight of the 156 men (5.1%) and 22 of the 198 women (11.1%) experienced VVR. One donor did not experience VVR during blood collection, but had a delayed reaction while resting afterward. Mean maximum DBF in the 30 donors in the VVR group was 64.7 6 13.7%, which was significantly higher than the 25.6 6 11.7% in the non-VVR group. At a maximum DBF threshold of 45%, sensitivity for discriminating between VVR and non-VVR donors was 93.3% and accuracy was 94.4%. When 45% DBF was used as the alert level, alerts were issued for 44 donors, including 25 in the VVR group. Therefore sensitivity for predicting VVR was 83.3% and specificity was 94.1%. Mean time from alert to diagnosis in the VVR group was 4.03 6 4.35 minutes, and accuracy of the alert was 56.8%. Some of the VVR could not be predicted even the value of maximum DBF exceeded 45%. The reason was supposed to be the difference of donor susceptibility on DBF. Conclusion: We investigated whether VVR in platelet apheresis donors can be prevented by prediction and found that it is possible to predict VVR early enough before onset to intervene by monitoring DBF in real time during blood collection using laser Doppler flowmetry. Future research must also investigate whether the incidence of VVR can actually be reduced by interventions such as adjusting extracorporeal circulation.",

It is critical in the management of SCD complications such as splenic sequestration, stroke, priapism, iron overload and acute chest syndrome. A wellrecognized complication of chronic transfusion in SCD patients is alloimmunization to RBC antigens. To prevent alloimmunization, transfusion with RBCs negative for C, E, and K antigens has been advocated. This has led to reports of reduction in the rate of alloimmunization and a decrease in hemolytic transfusion reactions. We report a summary of our three year experience with the prophylactic transfusion of RBC units negative for C, E, K antigens for SCD patients during red blood cell exchange transfusions (RBCx). Study Design/Method: Retrospective review of 10 SCD patients with a history of stroke, refractory sickle pain crisis and priapism was done. RBCx was performed every 4 to 8 weeks from December 2013 to March 2017. Blood bank work-up used the MTS gel method for antibody screen and identification. Our hospital-based donor center proactively works with the hospital blood bank in preparing these units in a timely manner. Results/Finding: A total of 10 patients, 3 females and 7 males, who underwent a total of 178 RBCx from October 2013 to March 2017, using an average number of 7 RBC units per RBCx. RBC units negative for C, E, and K antigens were used during RBCx for 8 patients. Two patients positive for C antigen underwent RBCx, using E and K antigen negative RBC units.",

Day to day variability previously dipped as low 40% split forcing reactive planning. Study Design/Method: Incorporate DXT to strategically plan our day to day operations. DXT reports were monitored by management and with the Fresenius Kabi team for productivity by site, phlebotomist and device. Reports measured target vs actual yield, donor parameters, and procedure events to perform a donation opportunity analysis. This allowed us to adjust configuration settings when appropriate to improve the accuracy of the yield prediction. Reports by phlebotomist were utilized for training on how to optimize the donor's gift to donate an additional platelet or plasma product(s) and increase procedure success rate. Results/Finding: The monthly DXT report analysis resulted in device configuration improvements, phlebotomist and center manager accountability, effective training, and donation optimization we increased our overall platelet split rate 15 percent and increased concurrent plasma collections by 24 percent. With utilization of the DXT reports we are able to take a proactive approach allowing us to predict product availability, with day to day variability dropping no lower than 62 percent split. Phlebotomist QNS rates were easily monitored regularly (daily, weekly monthly) resulting in a decrease in our overall QNS rate to consistently below 3 percent. Conclusion: DXT was easy to implement, is very user friendly and will continue to help improve our platelet collection and process improvements between donor centers. DXT provides invaluable tools for the Operational Supervisors to monitor their staff and improve productivity at their multiple sites. Next step is to develop the plan for implementation of paperless documentation with DXT and Healthcare-ID.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Clinical use of blood has shown to be the least developed part in the vein-to-vein transfusion chain. This global survey was therefore carried out in order to investigate the level of awareness, accessibility and utilization of e-continuous learning and quality of blood use among blood prescribing clinicians and nurses. Study Design/Methods: A descriptive 'ex-post facto' survey design was used; 264 purposively selected blood prescribing clinicians and nurses from 60 hospitals in 13 countries of the 4 Human Development Index (HDI) groups (Low, Medium, High, and Very High) participated. Three research questions were answered, while seven null hypotheses were tested at .05 level of significance. Descriptive statistical tools (frequency counts and percentage) were used to analyze the demographic backgrounds, while inferential statistics -Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMC), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), were used to analyse the hypotheses. Results/Findings: Quality of clinical use of blood was positively and significantly correlated with levels of awareness (r5 .137; p5.03; df5262) and accessibility (r5.184; p5.01; df5262) to e-continuous learning among blood prescribing clinicians/nurses. There was significant difference in levels of awareness [F(3,260) Conclusion: Today e-continuous learning has become a conditio sine qua non to effective and quality clinical use of blood. The higher the HDI level the better the awareness, accessibility and utilization of continuous education, both through e-learning and conventional programs. There is a better awareness among clinicians routinely prescribing blood as compared to others involved only incidentally in blood transfusion. Accessibility of e-learning depends highly on the presence of a sustained societal infrastructure which is less guaranteed in the Low and Medium HDI countries; reliable power supply, maintenance of hardware tools and updated software programs, together with the necessary knowledge and skills of e-technology are prominent factors. The results are used for policy and strategy recommendations to improve knowledge and clinical practice through continuous e-learning programs eg, starting at undergraduate medical and nursing schools and continuing at postgraduate vocational medical specialization institutes, principles of clinical transfusion practice should be comprehensively included through appropriate and timely curricula; creation of a technical climate to guarantee access to e-learning courses and materials; stimulation of national and international exchange of e-learning programs focused on continuing education; creation of an e-learning mentoring network through professional societies, associations and education institutes. Background/Case Studies: Transfusion medicine (TM) didactic teaching materials for pathology residents are not widely available to share among residency training programs. The Advancing Blood KnOwledge (ABO) Leaders project is a novel approach wherein education materials are created collaboratively through a community of practice (CoP). Educational theorist Etienne Wenger defined CoPs as groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly. Study Design/Method: As a pilot project, 7 junior faculty co-investigators from 5 west coast institutions each had 2 months to create a 30 minute PowerPoint presentation on a fundamental TM topic, after which 2 other members had 2 months to review and edit. Therefore, each member created 1 and reviewed 2 presentations (three total steps). During each step, members wrote 2 multiple-choice questions for those particular topics. In the end, each topic would have 6 quiz questions to assess learning. At completion, 7 evidence-based, peer reviewed presentations would be available for all members to use for teaching pathology residents. Three methods were planned to measure effectiveness of these materials: 1) Pre and postlecture ABO Leaders exam using the questions made for each topic to assess learning; 2) Pre and post-lecture 20 question validated examination (BEST Collaborative) to assess learning; 3) Resident In-service examination trends specific to TM. Results/Finding: Six presentations were developed as 6 of the 7 ABO Leaders members continue to participate in this CoP for TM education. ABO Leaders and BEST pre-test results are shown in tables 1 and 2. ABO Leaders pre-test data could not be obtained for institution B, and 3 trainees declined to participate in the examinations at institution A. Challenges experienced by the CoP have included heterogeneity between institutions\u00d5 resident schedules, balancing time dedicated to the group given busy schedules, and difficulty in giving all 6 presentations during the defined institution-specific teaching period. Post-test results will be included when assessments are complete. Conclusion: Despite logistical and organizational challenges, it is feasible to create a multicenter CoP for TM education. The impact of such a group on resident learning will be assessed and plans for growth will be evaluated. Background/Case Studies: The traditional educational curriculum for the pathology residency program is primarily based on didactic lectures, casebased presentations, and discussion of on-call cases. The use of dramatic vignettes has proven to be an effective educational tool to illustrate complex and multidisciplinary topics in medicine. Our goal is to use and evaluate the relevance of this approach in resident education. Study Design/Method: A clinical vignette based on a placenta accreta case was written by a pathology resident during the transfusion medicine rotation. During a two-week laboratory management course, residents prepared for the dramatic vignette performance with a focus on transfusion medicine and laboratory management topics. Each resident completed a 10 question preand post-test on topics related to the vignette. Several meetings for review and adaptation of the script, topic discussion, and rehearsals were held. There were several commonly encountered problems and deviations from the standard operating procedures that the residents in the audience were asked to identify prior to the performance. During the skit, each resident presented at least one major transfusion management teaching point. Results/Finding: The educational activity, including the 40 minute vignette performance and the 20 minute discussion, was completed with a focus on: communication between the operating room and the blood bank during surgery, maximum surgical blood order schedule, pre-transfusion testing, transfusion safety, informed consent, massive transfusion protocol, emergency release blood products, thromboelastometry interpretation, patient safety, adverse events, and root cause analysis. All performers significantly improved their scores in the post-test (mean 95 1 4%) when compared to the pre-test scores (mean 67 1 26%) ttest p<0.017. During the vignette discussion, residents together identified all the intended non-conformances and answered related questions. Residents in the audience actively participated in the post skit discussion and 90% reported a satisfactory learning experience.",

Dy 1 and Mary O'Neill 1 . 1 American Red Cross, 2 Georgetown University Background/Case Studies: Hemovigilance programs to monitor adverse events after transfusion depend on clinicians' ability to recognize and report reactions to the blood center. About 1 in 100,000 apheresis platelet donations are implicated in septic transfusion reactions (STRs), but this could underestimate the risk because of the difficulty in recognizing delayed or mild reactions. A large blood center designed an educational outreach program to increase awareness of STRs and assessed its effect on the rate of STR reporting to its national hemovigilance program. Study Design/Method: In Dec. 2015, a large blood center developed a web based course on STRs for CME/CEU credit. Letters were sent to 2,300 hospital customers about recognizing and reporting STRs, and alerting them to the availability of the course. Blood center physicians and staff in sales and marketing also engaged hospital customers directly in discussions about recognizing and reporting STRs, using the online educational content. The physicians tracked their interactions. The blood center's national hemovigilance program compared the number of STRs reported in the 12 months before and after launching the educational outreach. Results/Finding: The web based course was completed by more than 700 participants; 117 were physicians. Based on a review of the evaluations, the course was highly valued with 93% of participants rating it excellent or very good. The blood center physicians gave over 200 presentations to hospital customers. Reporting of suspected STRs in 2016 increased by 23% compared to the prior year. The increased reporting came from 2 specific regions. The total number of STRs that met the hemovigilance definitions for definite (culture-confirmed) and probable STRs in the nationwide system increased but did not change significantly compared to the previous years.",

Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center Background/Case Studies: Previous cGMP e-learning courses we developed required 30-45 minutes for learners to complete. While feedback was positive, manufacturing areas struggled to schedule time for staff to complete courses within their assigned schedules. At the same time, a shift in design trends suggest that subscription-based learning is more effective (Thalheimer, 2014.) Subscription-based e-learning utilizes 5-7 minute modules, delivered at regular intervals. This changes the learning process from a singular event to a regular interaction that reinforces learning and keeps the content at the top of the learner's mind. Study Design/Method: We began developing cGMP subscription-based elearning in 2016 by selecting our first five series topics: Equipment, Personnel, Labeling, SOPs, and Records. The first topic, Equipment, was divided into modules on Selection, Validation, Calibration, Quality Control, and Maintenance. These modules, and pre-and post-quizzes for the Equipment series, were developed and assigned to employees in manufacturing-related jobs using our learning management system.",

Level 2: Learning The average score of users increased 13% from the pre-test to the posttest, with the greatest improvements noted in the scores from laboratory employees. A two-sample t-Test determined the result to be statistically significant with a t-Critical value of 1.647 and a t-Stat value of 5.641. Level 4: Results While equipment-related errors decreased by 20% after training, there is not enough data to demonstrate a statistical significance. Conclusion: Our Level 1 and 2 evaluation data validated that the subscription approach was effective. Knowledge increased from the pre-to postquiz, learners reported that they appreciated the shorter training, and they completed the modules without special scheduling requirements. As a result, we are continuing development of the remaining series. Background/Case Studies: The interdisciplinary nature of transfusion medicine requires the collaboration of multiple work units for efficient patient care, but departmental \"silos\" impede collaboration between transfusionrelated care teams. We hypothesized that regular educational meetings would improve knowledge and awareness of each department's role, so in October 2013, a multidisciplinary educational meeting called Friday Blood Conference (FBC) began as a collaborative, interprofessional forum involving frontline staff of our transfusion practice. During these monthly meetings, which are also broadcast online for those unable to attend in person, presenters from different work units share background information and patient cases before opening the floor to constructive discussion. Study Design/Method: A survey was sent to FBC participants (n5151) to retrospectively capture the effect of FBC on interdepartmental collaboration. The survey was structured to obtain formative feedback using the published Interprofessional Collaborative Practice Competencies (ICPC) as a guide. These core competencies target maintaining a climate of mutual respect, communicating within and between departments, fostering teamwork, and understanding everyone's role in patient care. Results/Finding: Our survey response rate was 35%. Of those, 96% endorse that FBC creates a climate of respect within our transfusion practice, 94% believe it has improved communication between work units, and 98% feel that FBC leads to increased understanding of interdepartmental processes. Notably, laboratory scientists and transfusion nurses have the highest attendance rate. Furthermore, those attending via the online broadcast report the lowest satisfaction, with only 56% responding positively. The main reasons individuals attend FBC are to increase knowledge about transfusion medicine, interact with and learn from other departments, hear about patient case studies, and understand the \"big picture\" of one's role in patient care. Suggestions for improvement include preparing questions to help initiate discussion, increasing representation of other areas for broader perspectives during interdepartmental dialogue, and posting recordings of FBC for later viewing. Conclusion: The application of ICPC in transfusion medicine was an effective lens to assess the value of interprofessional collaboration. Although there is room for improvement, the results support that FBC has contributed to better communication between transfusion-related care teams and has increased understanding of interdepartmental processes within our transfusion practice.",

            "text": "Novel Approach to Curriculum Development: Demystifying Transfusion Medicine Ritcha Saxena* and Ananya Saxena. All Saints University School of Medicine Background/Case Studies: Transfusion medicine is an essential element of education required for the future physicians in various disciplines like surgery, internal medicine and anesthesiologists to work effectively with the blood bank personnel. Transfusion carries considerable advantages as well as risks. Consequently, educational initiatives are required to identify the particular knowledge deficits in transfusion medicine and subsequently, bridge the gaps. And the challenge is to update the undergraduate medical curriculum to reflect the latest enhancements in transfusion medicine. Study Design/Methods: 41 students of undergraduate Semester 3 and 59 students of Semester 4 participated in the study. Self-directed learning resources combined with modules of interactive instruction were implemented in a TBL course design. Five education modules focusing on quality management, blood collection, transfusion reactions, precise utilization of blood products and innovations in component safety were designed for the students. The students' reaction to TBL in Transfusion Medicine was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to analyze knowledge attainment and critical thinking development along with team continuity. The participants were first assessed with Readiness Assurance Testing (RAT) to guarantee that they understood the concepts and their application followed by case study based test questions. Results/Findings: Students' reaction to TBL was primarily positive, with 86% of students giving a positive feedback. Evaluation through Readiness Assurance Testing (RAT) illustrated improved team knowledge acquisition in implementation of effective quality management systems over knowledge acquired through individual study. Students grasped a conceptual knowledge of principles of transfusion medicine and achieved confidence in dealing with transfusion-related complications. Anecdotally, students significantly attained perception in blood component preparation, storage and their optimal utilization along with developments in safety techniques in blood donation. Conclusion: Our study suggests that reforming the medical curricula for undergraduate medical students, with specific educational modules designed to focus on blood banking and blood transfusion principles and latest advances in transfusion medicine, is much required in the interest of patient care and safety, by the future physicians. TBL is an interesting and efficient way to deliver the key aspects of transfusion medicine to the students. Results/Finding: Open house attendees were given tours of the BB, led by a BB attending, BB residents, BB supervisor, or BB Quality Coordinator. The Patient Blood Management nurse was also in attendance to answer attendee questions and educate about Patient Blood Management. Light refreshments were offered to the attendees in the BB break room. The first BB open house was held on Wednesday, 12/7/16 from 9-11am. There were 17 attendees, including a second-year medical student, four regular blood donors at the hospital blood donor center (who were also employees in Facilities Management and the University Office of Admissions, respectively), a hospital senior vice-president, six apheresis nurses, two clinical laboratory staff, two medical laboratory science students, and one additional staff member from the University Office of Admissions. The second BB open house was held on Thursday, 4/20/17 from 7-11am. There were 14 attendees, including 2 regular blood donors (who were also employees in the Office of International Affairs and Supply Chain, respectively), a hematology/oncology fellow, and 11 surgical residents. Background/Case Studies: Simple, partial, and exchange transfusions are routinely performed in patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) with the goal to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and reduce the relative percentage of sickled cells. It is essential for clinicians to be able to rapidly estimate the effects of the available therapeutic modalities using clinical information to minimize the risk of red blood cell exposure. Given that the formulas for these calculations are complicated, we developed and validated an online calculator to assist physicians with such tasks. Study Design/Method: A web application was generated (www.Phamcalcs.com). The performance of the simple transfusion and partial manual exchange calculators were validated by comparing the predictions to clinical data. The performance of the automated and depletion RBCx calculators was validated using the Terumo BCT (Lakewood, CO) calculator up to a fraction cells remaining (FCR) 50% as patients with FCR 50% may benefit from delaying the procedure for performance in the future. Validation process included (1) a Deming regression to globally assess the predicted vs. actual results and (2) an individual comparison wherein validation was contingent on the (predicted-expected results)/(expected results) demonstrating |D| 15%. Validation was performed for hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin S (HgbS) level post-transfusion for simple and partial manual exchange and volume of replacement fluid for automated and depletion RBC exchange. Results/Finding: See Table 1 Background/Case Studies: With the focus on new technologies the modern medicine requires more expenses. Despite the increase in the target impact on patients there is still a risk of adverse reactions to medical treatment. The issues that are currently under discussion: the use of standardized or personalized approach, for doctors -being multidisciplinary or having a narrow specialization, integration of new technologies, the need for more trainings resulted from knowledge deficiency. In Russia, the development of insurance medicine creates the demand for more intensive and cost-effective treatment programs. As a multidisciplinary approach, PBM optimizes the transfusion practice reducing the risk of adverse effects and improving the financial performance of a health care institution. However, the prosperous implementation of PBM also requires supplemental medical competencies that provide harmonization of dialogue logistics: administrator -clinician -transfusiologist. Study Design/Method: At the Medical Simulation Centre of hospital there has been a unique opportunity to launch an educational program for the medical specialists practicing blood components transfusion. The main innovative features of the training course are an interdisciplinary approach, intensive learning performance, comprehensiveness of learning methods. During 2 days (18 academic hours) the trainees can attend 6 lectures, discuss the methodical materials, participate in 3 seminars, 2 interactive clinical discussions, a Master Class and a game that presents the modelling of working processes. Since initiating the project in June, 2016 with the group capacity 220A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 of up to 35 people the number of medical specialists who have attended the training is nearly 450.

In an effort to reduce errors and improve emergency response, a group was formed to evaluate the effectiveness of emergency situation drills (ESD). The ESD were based on common emergent situations encountered in the lab and were run once per month per shift. The main goal of ESD was to improve teamwork and comfort level during real emergent situations; therefore reducing the amount of unplanned standard operating procedure (SOP) deviations. Study Design/Method: Prior to ESD implementation, a survey was sent to all technologists to determine baseline comfort levels associated with various emergent situations. One year post ESD implementation the same survey was sent to all technologists to reassess the comfort levels for the same situations. The surveys asked employees to rate satisfaction and comfort level on a grading scale of 1-100; 1 being least satisfied/comfortable and 100 being most satisfied/comfortable. The pre and post survey results were evaluated by calculating lab average comfort levels per situation and survey. In addition, unplanned SOP deviations related to emergent situations were counted for one year before and one year after ESD implementation. Results/Findings: Out of 35 total technologists, 31 technologists took the pre ESD survey and 25 technologists took the one year post ESD implementation survey. Table 1 shows the lab averages from the pre and post surveys as well as the percent difference. Out of the employees who responded to the post survey, 19 (76.0%) answered \"true\" to the statement \"ESD have improved my comfort level with emergent situations.\" In the year prior to ESD implementation there were 14 unplanned SOP deviations; in the year after ESD implementation there were only 5 deviations.",

As described in the first installment of this series about therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), the challenges of access, volume management, and instrumentation persist, as along with the need to address the psychological and emotional well being of this population. RBC exchange is a complicated procedure to explain to adults and becomes an even more intimidating task when translating into the language of childhood. Nevertheless, pre-treatment education is shown to decrease the anxiety associated with medical care. Providing age appropriate specific treatment information to pediatric patients decreases negative behaviors, reduces stress and promotes faster recovery. A previous project explaining TPE to the pediatric population revealed the lack of age specific literature for apheresis procedures in general, including TPE and RBC exchange. Study Design/Method: In collaboration with a Child Life Specialist, an ageappropriate story-driven explanation of the RBC exchange procedure was adapted from a previously implemented project related to TPE. Artwork was produced with the aid of a medical illustrator to complement the story-line. Results/Finding: The story board addresses why RBC exchange is performed, the steps involved in preparing for and performing the procedure, and strategies for coping before, during and after the procedure. The idea of long-term therapy is also briefly addressed, to prepare these children for the concept of ongoing therapy. The booklet is in production in concert with our hospital's medical illustrator and will be available on our hospital website for patient use. Conclusion: Using the previously illustrated story as a guide, an explanation of red cell exchange was created to provide education and reduce anxiety. This second installment continues the pediatric series helping to explain apheresis procedures to pediatric populations in the hopes of reducing patient stress and promoting age appropriate coping strategies.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: A critical aspect of implementing a new method in manufacturing blood products is to develop a training plan that adequately prepares staff but doesn't interfere with production or cause delays in patient care. With the implementation of Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) using INTERCEPTV R Blood System for Platelets it was understood that we would need more collections to make up for the loss of products, specifically our triple collections. Our institution collects the majority of its blood products and supplements inventory from a major blood collection center. It was crucial for the Component Laboratory to maintain daily processing levels while learning the new method in order to sustain optimal platelet inventory levels without relying on purchasing additional platelets from external vendors. Our approach in introducing PRT for apheresis platelets was to \"flip the switch\" and process all products with the new method rather than a step wise roll out with a dual inventory. Study Design/Method: It was essential to prioritize who would be trained first. Collections occur Monday through Friday from 0600 to 1600. The first group to be trained was those who would be performing training (a two person team) and product validation; they were trained by Cerus deployment team. The second group was those who would process platelets on weekends and evening hours without direct management support. The last group was the technologists who would be working during normal hours with direct management support. PRT processing for platelets in 100% plasma is broken up in to two days. On Day 0 platelets are treated with amotosalen and placed in a Compound Adsorption Device to remove residual amotosalen for 12-24 hours. On Day 1 products are removed from the CAD and modified into final product codes and labeled. Each technologist was trained one on one, over a one week period. The trainers alternated training processing days for Day 0 and Day 1. In the weeks following training it was important that each technologist rotated back thru PRT processing to maintain proficiency. Results/Finding: 13 of 18 employees were trained in a two month time period. Prior to \"flipping the switch\" the daily average of products collected was 21. For the two month training period the daily average rose to 23. Conclusion: Our \"flip the switch\" training plan for implementing PRT platelets in 100% plasma has been highly successful for our laboratory; training while implementing the new technology did not create a bottle-neck in the process. It was imperative to prioritize who would be trained first to insure complete coverage during off hour shifts. Technologists were able to become proficient with the new process while maintaining daily processing expectations and sustaining an optimal platelet inventory. accepted depending on each individual's conscience. Due to these unique medical challenges, it is important for caretakers to have an understanding of their beliefs in order to provide optimal care. We describe the process of identifying JW in our hospital and communicating treatment needs to staff. Study Design/Methods: Proper treatment of JW requires the ability to identify the patient and his/her needs. When a JW is admitted to our hospital, our electronic medical record (EMR) triggers several processes based on the patient's listed religion. One process creates an order that reminds caretakers to complete the Declining Blood Consent (DBC) with the patient. The DBC contains language declining MABF and reviews the MIBF with the patient to identify any that would be accepted. The EMR order regarding the DBC provides educational links that include a bloodless policy, step-by-step instructions on obtaining the DBC, and information on alternatives to transfusion.",

These patients are followed by the PBM nurses and medical director during the duration of care. Treatment plans to optimize hemoglobin, oxygen carrying capacity, and hemostasis are discussed with the bedside caretakers and implemented as needed. Results/Findings: Nearly 100% of JW that enter our hospital have a DBC completed. This has resulted in increased education of the medical staff. In addition, patients have reported better communication with caretakers leading to a more inviting environment for the patients. Conclusion: Our hospital has found success by using an education-based team-oriented approach involving EMR, PBM, and caretakers when caring for the JW patient. This approach has set up a foundation for treating other bloodless medicine patients. Background/Case Studies: Transfusion services should provide safe blood components from vein to vein with donors acting as suppliers and patients as final customers. This process involves labor-intensive activities, critical materials, human resources, facilities and highly coordinated processes. Cost management has a great impact on technical processes guiding decisions upon supplies and technical staff. Activity-based costing (ABC) is a method to determine cost drivers within activities and determine process or product final cost allowing managers to take precise decisions. We demonstrate how an effective ABC approach can result in financial savings without compromising process quality in a mid-size transfusion service. Study Design/Method: Materials costs can represent as far as 90% of an activity. In 2015 we had a central storage supplying satellite storages at each department and replacement was done independent of residual stock. Purchases were performed on demand. At the end of 2015 we performed a supply inventory on all departments to plan future purchases and control residual stocks. In 2016, we implemented annual purchases and satellite storages were supplied only to replenish programmed stock. Cost drivers were defined upon activities on standard operational procedures (SOPs) resulting in a 2016 cost estimate. Technical staff was involved in cost driver calculations to indicate possible changes to SOPs, supplier and deliveries. To minimize seasonal fluctuations we compared last quarter 2015 (Q4/15) with last quarter 2016 (Q4/16). In this work we present activity data from blood collections to illustrate ABC method. Results/Finding: In Q4/15 1756 blood bags were used compared to 1998 in Q4/16, demonstrating an activity \"13.78%. Price negotiation resulted in 12.58% readjustment. Both indicated an estimated cost \"28.10% with a possible impact of over US$ 35,000. We have identified a real cost #2.31% in Q4/16, representing an overall #14.89% and US$ 3,716.72 (R$12,235.16) savings. Conclusion: Economy had deteriorated in our country in 2016 with higher inflation and exchange rate variations, directly impacting imported materials, most of them critical. Even with adverse economy, ABC showed to be an effective tool that allowed cost decrease without significant changes in critical materials and processes. Cost drivers calculations demanded review of SOPs and suppliers by technical staff resulting in optimization of activities. Also, staff involvement reduced discharged materials since costs were wellknown to area supervisors and satellite stocks were reviewed briefly.",

The simultaneous hospital move/merger and implementation of a new eHR constituted an arduous task that would not have been possible had substantial preparations not been initiated a year in advance. Training is essential to the success for a scope of change this big and should not be minimized. While training was thorough prior to the move, gaps were nonetheless discovered following the move.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ) introduced its first Performance Management System (PMS) in 2006. In the 2015-2018 NBSZ strategic plan it was noted that the current PMS lacked objectivitety and there was no relationship between perfomance and remuneration. In order to revise the PMS, the NBSZ set up a three membered committee at the Executive Management level to spearhead the revamp of the NBSZ PMS. The aim of the new PMS was to achieve a shared vision of the purpose and objectives of the organization, helping each staff member to understand and recognize the contribution to the strategic plan. In this paper, we share how NBSZ revamped and implemented its new hybrid PMS that derived its inputs from established PMSs and NBSZ monitoring and evaluation (M&E) process that have been linked together. One-selected departmental results for one quarter are shared to demonstrate how the system works. Study Design/Method: PMS Committee developed and shared with Executive Management a PMS conceptual and implementation framework. Consultations including field visits were done on three established PMS to assess suitability for NBSZ adoption. A hybrid PMS was adopted for NBSZ and a pilot application for one quarter on selected department was done. Review of policy, procedures to including hybrid PMS templates and forms were done. PMS Committee trained all staff on how to implement an integrated scorecard, how to conduct appraisal, how to develop scorecards, how to measure performance using the new PMS, how weighted performance reward systems based on all layers of performance for bonus payments works using standardised tools. Throughout the process risk assessment were done. Results/Finding: The NBSZ Hybrid PMS is based on five levels of planning namely Strategic, departmental, branch, sectional and individual. The fourcoloured traffic light reporting system is central in uniformly assessing performance at all levels. The levels of accountability were properly defined for each level of planning. A weighted overall integrated individual scorecard (IIS) is determined based on 60% individual and 40% for the other four levels (10% for each). The bonus (%) is calculated based on the IIS as follows; Category A: 100% (IIS >575%), Category B: 75% (IIS: 50 -<75%), Category C: 50% (IIS: 25-<50%) and Category D: 0% (IIS < 25%). On the pilot implementation, the individual scores for 12 staff ranged from 71% to 100%. The IIS were 76% to 81%. The number of staff in each bonus categories were 11, 92% (Category A) and 1, 8% (Category B). Conclusion: The new hybrid PMS was generally accepted by all staff and it was easily implemented at various staff levels. This provides a basis for the full implementation of the new PMS and this simplified PMS can be easily be adapted in similar settings to ensure all staff contribute sufficiently and objectively to the realisation of the organisation strategic vision.",

Background/Case Studies: Rare donors are defined as a blood type occurring in less than 1 in 1000 people in a given population. These donors are discovered by testing new donors in a random or targeted way and require testing many donors to find one rare donor. Once found, if the facility is a member of the American Rare Donor Program (by being an AABB Accredited or American Red Cross accredited IRL), the donor is registered in the ARDP database as a rare donor. In 2016, there were 65,801 active rare donors in the ARDP. With the mobility of the population in the USA, it is important that as donors relocate, that they are recognized as a rare donor when they donate and their unit can be identified and used for a patient with a rare blood need. In addition, when recruitment is needed for a patient need, correct contact information on the donor is required.",

            "text": "Study Design/Method: The ARDP procedure for ARDP members requires that donors be contacted every six months to ensure that ARDP (or the facility) has their latest contact information. The timing is determined by the postal service time limit of six months to forward mail to a new address. This contact ensures that if recruitment is required to obtain blood for a patient with a rare blood need, the donor can be contacted by the collecting center to donate. This contact is achieved by ARDP sending a contact card by postal mail twice yearly to all donors for whom the ARDP has address demographics. Results/Finding: The ARDP reports on the information obtained from the contact cards returned in the ARDP Annual Activity Report to the ARDP Members at the AABB Annual meeting. Of the 6398 (9.7% of total active donors) returned contact cards alerting ARDP of changes in calendar year 2016, 355 (5.5%) were donors moving from one ARDP facility to another, 1369 (21.4%) were donors no longer eligible to donate, and an additional 4324 (68.4%) were address changes. Other changes were 115 (1.8%) reactivated donors and 235 (3.5%) donors who we were notified were deceased, or did not want to be listed in the ARDP. In 2016, 5390 new rare donors were submitted to ARDP for registration. The number of donors that could potentially be lost to follow-up in 2016 was 4709 (355 1 4324), which would be 87.4% of the new donors submitted. Conclusion: With nearly a 10% response rate for donors receiving the mailed contact cards, it is clear that rare donors (and their families) are responsive to the ARDP contact card, and inform ARDP of address changes and changes in their health status that affects their ability to donate. This is evidence of the importance of the card in ensuring correct donor contact information. In 2016, 4709 donors changed their addresses which often are not known to the collecting facility until the donors donates again, after their move. The ARDP contact card is effective in retaining the relationship with the ARDP registered donors and keeps the address information of rare donors current.",

No false positive or false negative typing results or false negative screenings occurred with results auto-verification. (RBC) has remained, and in fact is proportionally increasing while blood usage has notably declined in the era of patient blood management. Over the past 2 years a steady increase in demand for O Neg RBC compared to other blood types has been observed at our blood center. Utilization metrics for hospital customers are monitored monthly for overall trending and forecasting and the data shared with them during regular visits. Despite heightening awareness, percent O Neg RBC sales continued to rise by 1% annually and peaked at 16% in mid 2016. To better understand this increased demand a survey was conducted to gather insight for improved utilization. We speculated that during the survey an observer effect, or change in the staff behavior, would result in reduction of O Neg RBC sales. Study Design/Methods: A tie tag was designed as a survey tool and attached to each O Neg RBC distributed to hospital customers for an 8week period in late 2016. Hospital transfusion service staff were asked to record the final disposition of the O Neg RBC (transfused, wasted, returned) on the tie tag. Information on the survey objective and instructions for tie tag completion were communicated via customer meetings, emails and reminders sent by blood center drivers. Completed tags were returned to the blood center. Customers are allowed to return RBC units with greater than 10 day shelf life remaining. Units with tie tags attached were in hospital inventories for up to 3 months due to the shelf life of RBC. Return rates and percent of net sales (gross sales minus returns) by ABO/Rh type were tracked monthly before, during and after the survey. Results/Findings: Participation was 100% of the 56 hospitals surveyed. Mean percent O Neg RBC gross sales for a 3 month period before, during, and after the survey was 16.6%, 16.0% and 16.5%, respectively. Mean percent O Neg net sales during the 3-month survey fell to 13.5% compared to an average of 15.4% in the 3 months prior. During the 3-month survey period O Neg RBC monthly return rate increased to an average of 28.4% compared to an average of 23.0% in the 3 months prior. For the 3 months after the survey the average O Neg RBC return rate further increased to 28.9% while mean percent O Neg RBC net sales trended slightly upward to 14.1%. When customer hospitals were queried whether any process changes occurred, no major changes to policy or inventory levels were reported. Conclusion: During and after the survey percent O Neg RBC gross sales was fairly constant indicating that target inventory levels and transfusion service staff ordering practices remained unchanged. However, during the same period the increase in O Neg RBC return rate and corresponding decline in percent net sales suggests improved O Neg RBC utilization. Increased awareness from participating in the survey and staff knowing they were being observed likely played a role in the lowering of percent O Neg RBC net sales. Tracking of monthly metrics will provide ongoing review to determine if the effect is transient or sustained and identify other opportunities for improving O Neg RBC utilization.",

Then we did some updated on Atreus; in 2011 we changed to Atreus 3C (Terumo BCT) and finally in 2013, we moved to Reveos system (Terumo BCT).

We encourage maintaining lean philosophy in order to keep improving our methods and identifying those activities that add value to our processes and get rid of those ones that are not necessary. In a globalized and industrialized world, where everything changes very fast, these improvements are necessary to be on top of the field and be a state of the art blood bank. Background/Case Studies: The laboratory envisioned an automated blood product delivery system that extended blood access to the bedside through the use of Remote Blood Allocation Devices, or \"smart blood refrigerators\" to improve patient safety, provide timely access to blood products, and potentially reduce laboratory workload. As part of this initiative, BloodTrack HaemoBanks (HB) (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA) were installed and interfaced to the existing SafeTrace Tx (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA) Laboratory Information System. One HB was installed in the Methodist Hospital (RMH) campus which includes a busy outpatient Infusion Therapy Center (ITC). Study Design/Method: An assessment of the current blood supply chain revealed improvement opportunities for both nursing and blood bank staff. Frequent daily trips to and from the blood bank take nurses away from the patient beside and can create congestion at the blood bank window during peak times. For the ITC, with a daily outpatient volume of 140-160 patients and an average, round-trip travel time of approximately 15-minutes, even small delays waiting in line at the blood bank window would produce profound ripple effects. ITC nurses faced the additional challenge of maintaining nurse-to-patient ratios and providing timely patient care. About 30% of patients in the ITC have same-day transfusion orders, adding to the blood bank workload and creating unpredictability in workflow. Often for patients in the ITC, nurses had to repeat pre-transfusion vital signs because too much time had elapsed between gathering vitals and obtaining the blood. These inefficiencies resulted in longer patient wait times and, ultimately, a longer stay in the ITC. Results/Finding: HB devices allow nursing staff to access red blood cells (RBC) for the majority of their patients at the point of care. Since implementing in November 2015, the HB has significantly improved the turnaround time of RBC issue -from 15-minutes to less than 60-seconds-and helped maintain nurse to patient ratios and reduced traffic at the blood bank issue window. Prior to HB implementation, blood bank staff at RMH were issuing approximately 750 RBC per month out of the window for non-surgical patients. This has been reduced to approximately 300 RBC per month, a 60% average monthly reduction. Conclusion: Having the HB located in the ITC has helped to expedite the care of patients and more easily manage blood products for patients with same-day orders. The use of HB devices has not resulted in a reduction in blood bank FTE, but rather a shift in workload; from issuing products to monitoring inventory and restocking. consists of registered paramedics that are pararescue specialists and helicopter personnel.

These data support a policy of wasting units that are returned to the blood bank with RBC units on top of the ice. Background/Case Studies: An FDA draft guidance has highlighted the need to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination of platelet components (PC) via pathogen reduction (PR) or secondary rapid testing (RT). Hospitals must understand the cost implications that may result. Our objective was to create an interactive model to analyze the budget impact for different PC types across the range of existing US hospitals. Study Design/Methods: An Excel model was built and populated with base case costs and probabilities identified through literature search as well as through a survey administered to 27 US hospital transfusion service directors. The model was reviewed and refined by a panel of seven transfusion medicine physicians. The model allows base-case assumptions to be overwritten with values specific to the institution. Three scenarios were generated to compare annual costs of plt acquisition, testing, wastage, dispensing /transfusion, adverse events (AE), shelflife, and reimbursement for a hospital that purchases all of its PCs: 100% conventional (C-PC), 100% PR-PC, and mix of 75% C-PC/25% PR-PC. The model predicts a modest ($4%) cost increase for PR-PC compared to C-PC depending on the degree of PR conversion; this takes into account cost offsets such as elimination of BD and irradiation, decreased waste due to increased shelf-life, and outpatient reimbursement. The effective PC shelf-life is potentially increased with PR due to elimination of BD, and is dependent on NAT turnaround time. Benefits not captured by the model include transfusion-transmitted infectious risk mitigation from emerging pathogens, which may impact cost/benefit analyses. Future iterations of this model will also enable hospitals to consider scenarios in which RT is used. This model can serve as an important tool for hospitals considering PR adoption. in January 2011. A report was created to identify donors previously classified as rare according to the American Rare Donor Program (ARDP) criteria. Donors are classified as rare by meeting one of the following: highprevalence antigen negative, multiple common antigen negative, or IgA deficient. The new process utilized the report and involved sending a letter to the donors notifying them of their rare donor status and encouraging them to continue to donate. A database was created to track the letters sent to rare donors. In August 2013, inventory reduction efforts were implemented to gradually decrease the number of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) collected to minimize unit age at transfusion. The inventory reduction occurred in phases and was completed by January 2015. A study was performed to determine the impact of the inventory reduction on the number of rare donor donations. Study Design/Methods: The total number of allogeneic RBC donations, rare donor donations, and number of rare donor letters sent was analyzed from 2010 to 2016 (see Table) . The percentage of rare donor donations per year was calculated. Background/Case Studies: Blood Centers (Clients) often carry low inventory of blood and blood components. Laboratories performing donor screening therefore, have limited time to determine the presence or absence of infectious disease within these products. In order to measure and ensure expedited donor screening we implemented a daily performance metric consisting of upload time goals for release of results to Clients. In 2016, ZKV-NAT testing was implement for travel deferral donors (July), followed by universal individual donor screening in September and November in response to the FDA recommendations for \"Reducing the Risk of ZKV Transmission by Blood and Blood Components\". Per the FDA guidance we implemented mandatory ZKV testing for Clients with proximity to areas with locally acquired mosquito-borne cases of ZKV within 4 weeks (Sept. Phase 1) and nationwide within 12 weeks (Nov. Phase 2). ZKV testing is performed on individual samples, unlike all other NAT tests that are performed in minipools (16-donations). Therefore ZKV testing has a disproportionate impact on the turnaround times for testing, which we analyzed in this study. Study Design/Method: Within two regional testing labs, participating in the same clinical trial, Lab 1 had 86% and Lab 2 had 77% of Clients requiring universal ZKV testing. We evaluated a 12-month test result upload performance period to determine the impact of ZKV test implementation.",

            "text": "Enhanced Platelet Bacterial Screening in an Eight-Hospital System Robin Larson* 1 and Colleen A. Aronson 2 . 1 Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, 2 ACL Laboratories/ Advocate Hospitals Background/Case Studies: In response to two platelet-related septic transfusion reactions and the draft FDA guidance released in March 2016 regarding bacterial risk control strategies for transfusion services, an eight-hospital system implemented the Verax PGD enhanced platelet bacterial screening test in 6 of the 8 hospital transfusion services. The 2 sites that did not implement the test arranged for fresh platelets to be rotated in from the blood supplier. The 6 sites which implemented the Verax PGD test perform testing on all day 4 and day 5 platelets to be issued for transfusion. This abstract summarizes the data collected for the first 5 weeks of testing. Study Design/Methods: Platelet bacterial testing logs were reviewed over the entire time period studied for platelets tested on day 4, day 5, and those that were tested twice. Inventory reports were reviewed for platelets issued on day 2 or day 3 that did not require testing, and for the total number of platelets issued over the time period studied. Results/Findings: In the month of February (1 week of performing the test), 48.1% of all platelets issued by the 6 participating transfusion services were day 2 or day 3 platelets. In March that number dropped to 29.9%. It is expected that this number will level off at some percentage at or below 29.0% with further data collection. In February 25.9% of platelets were tested twice prior to final issue from the transfusion services. In March Conclusion: The percent of platelets issued fresh (day 2 or day 3) will likely level off at some number at or below 29.9% due to inventory management from both the blood supplier and the individual transfusion services. Testing platelets twice is undesirable. Ideally, no platelets would be tested twice as this represents a high cost for both the test reagents as well as the staff time to complete the testing. In addition, 5 of the 6 sites performing testing are Level 1 Trauma Centers and need to have tested platelets available at all times. This will require some amount of double testing, but the goal is to have this number be as low as possible, so that the percent of tested vs issued platelets does not exceed 100%. As the transfusion service staff becomes more comfortable with judging inventory levels and performing testing, it is expected that the amount of double testing will decrease. Background/Case Studies: In order to make up for the deficiency of the apheresis platelets in clinical application, and also to improve the comprehensive utilization of blood, we investigate the feasibility of preparation of pooled platelet concentrates(PCs) for providing a reliable source for clinical application. To speed up the storage research of pooled PCs in China, we evaluate the changes in platelet function after filtering leukocytes with leukocytes filter for PCs and the quality changes during storage in PVC-BTHC blood bags. Study Design/Method: PCs were prepared from 400 mL virus free whole blood by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) method. Five or six bags of ABOmatched PCs were pooled and filtered with leukocytes filter for PCs(n57). The swirling phenomenon, pH, automatic blood count, platelet aggregation, hypotonic shock response (HSR), the extent of shape change(ESC), CD62p expression, ATP level in platelet, glucose and lactate concentration were detected before and after filtering, and on days1, 3, 5 and 7 of storage, respectively. Results/Finding: The platelet recovery ratio of a therapeutic dose of pooled platelet concentrates after filtering leukocytes was (86.7 6 1.6)%, relative change rate of HSR was (3.87 6 12.75)%, the residual leukocytes were (0.15 6 0.15)310 6 . The pH, HSR, and the CD62p expression of pooled platelet concentrates before and after filtering were (7.00 6 0.17) vs (7.06 6 0.16), (66.96 6 12.35)% vs (63.22 6 8.26)% and (28.94 6 14.25) % vs (31.60 6 16.77)%. There is significant change for WBC after filtering (P<0.01). During storage in PVC-BTHC blood bags, the biochemical parameters of pooled platelet concentrates changed with increasing storage time, as shown in table 1.",

AJBlair Laboratory Consulting Background/Case Studies: Current methods used to obtain samples from blood component tubing segments are cumbersome and present a significant risk for exposure to biohazards, sharps injury and cross contamination. ITL BioMedical has developed SampLokV R Segment Sampler (SS), a device for obtaining measured samples from sealed tubing segments that is less cumbersome and offers improved safety, eliminating the need to manually cut and squeeze tubing segments. SS was evaluated with the goals of reducing the number of steps required to obtain a measured sample, and, reduce biohazards and sharps exposure. Study Design/Method: SS obtains fluid samples from sealed tubing segments into a needleless syringe. It consists of two chambers with recessed internal needles located at the top of the device and a female port located at the bottom of the device. A needleless syringe is attached to the female port, the sealed tubing ends are then aligned with the SS chambers and, gently pushed onto the needles to pierce each end of the segment. The sample from the segment is then withdrawn into the syringe.",

Two lengths of tubing segments were filled to contain sample volumes of 500mL and 1000mL. Two users then evaluated the SS tubing segment types with 500mL or 1000mL samples for a total of 10 data points. Samples were collected into the attached 1mL or 3mL syringe then a measured sample was transferred from the syringe into a test tube or microcentrifuge tube. Results were tabulated as PASS or FAIL. Results/Finding: A total of 10 SS were evaluated by two users. All samples were successfully collected and transferred into tubes. Insertion of the segment edge requires observation to ensure placement onto the needles. Any air bubbles collected into the syringe could easily be moved to the top by Background/Case Studies: The management of platelet inventory is crucial due to a number of factors including the 5 day product outdate, the allocation of staff due to the lengthy donation process, the increasingly small donor pool, and the high cost of production (e.g. platelet collection kits, testing, product processing). The use of a platelet inventory management tool has the potential to enhance the understanding of units transfused, optimize inventory, increase efficiency, and reduce waste. The objectives of this assessment were to decipher if the platelet inventory management tool has reduced the amount of outdated platelet products, total cost of platelet production, and full time equivalent (FTE) allocation. Study Design/Method: In January 2015, a platelet inventory management process was implemented which uses a spreadsheet based tool to predict the amount of platelet collection procedures needed to be scheduled each day. The tool uses daily historical transfusion data from the last five weeks. Additional calculations are included to account for deferrals, no shows, incomplete collections, and product split rate. The number generated from the calculations correlates to how many platelet collection procedures to schedule for the specific day of the week considering testing release and historical daily transfusion trends. The effectiveness of the tool was verified by comparing platelet collections, platelet products outdated, and FTE information for a one year period prior to the implementation of platelet inventory management to one year period following implementation. Results/Finding: By implementing a platelet inventory management tool, collections have been lowered or shifted to accommodate the transfusion needs. The staffing adjustments and targeted collections have lowered FTE and outdate cost by 22%. The platelet outdate rates dropped after implementing the platelet inventory tool from 14% (1324 units) to 11% (874 units); a 21% decrease. FTE was able to be monitored closely with the donor schedule and lowered from a yearly average of 7 FTE to 6.2 FTE, lowering FTE by 11%. Conclusion: Considering historical transfusion data for potential platelet demand has had a positive impact on scheduling platelet collections. Staffing requirements and outdating products have decreased since implementation of the platelet management spreadsheet tool, leading to less waste both in terms of staffing and platelets. Given these positive results, we are beginning to develop a similar tool for our whole blood collections.",

In addition, determining if established par levels of individual components meet or exceed daily transfusion needs is difficult to ascertain. A pilot was designed to track and monitor all blood components from distribution at the BC to issue in a hospital TS using Fresenius Kabi CompoTrace Radio Frequency ID (RFID) enabled Inventory Management System. The objectives were to determine feasibility of the CompoTrace system and analyze CompoTrace data for real-time usage and optimal inventory levels. Study Design/Method: A 3 month pilot was conducted at a pediatric hospital and its BC using both BBIS and CompoTrace systems to track all adult-size blood components. Staff were trained on use of CompoTrace system. Upon receipt of order from pilot hospital, BC staff applied RFID tags to all component bags and scanned components into the CompoTrace system. Components were transported and delivered to TS following established procedures. Upon receipt at the hospital, components were scanned into inventory using both the TS BBIS and CompoTrace systems. Dual scanning of components occurred upon issue to or return from floor, component modification or return to BC. Products for emergency use or at time of high demand were not RFID-scanned. A priori, the pilot would stop if the Compo-Trace system hampered current workflow, component issue was delayed or if TS errors increased. No inventory changes were made during the pilot. Results/Findings: Real-time data from CompoTrace system provided actual usage for all blood components including component disposal and shipment to and from BC.

Real-time data from CompoTrace system identified optimal inventory levels for RBC at the pilot TS. Use of real-time RFID to track inventory and adjust target levels based on actual daily usage over time may reveal seasonal influences that affect target inventory. Background/Case Studies: Physicians expect blood to be available at all times. Following a national appeal in July 2016 for donors based on a predicted summer shortage with high likelihood of extending into the fall, our transfusion service (TS) recognized a potentially dire situation given the institution's patient acuity. Our hospital-based TS supports a full range of services: a Level I trauma service; stem cell and solid organ transplant services; a brisk cardiothoracic surgical program; a high risk obstetrical service; and high acuity medical/surgical services. A regional donor center supplies our blood products. To insure appropriate response to patient needs, the TS created a management plan, with input from multiple stakeholders, to assist with product management in times of extreme shortages. The approach is described herein. Study Design/Method: At the direction of the Transfusion Committee (TC), TS directors presented the concern for impending shortages to the hospital Quality Directors (QD) committee. The QD committee consists of clinicians and non-clinicians trained in health care quality/regulatory affairs who are responsible for institutional Health Care Quality (HCQ) activities. The QD recommended creation of a multidisciplinary team: \"the blood shortage task force (BSTF)\", analogous to an existing task force started for management of drug shortages. Results/Finding: With HCQ and TC support, the TS created the BSTF and blood shortage management algorithm (BSMA). Standing Members of the BSTF include TS Medical Director (Chair), Senior Vice President (SVP) of HCQ, SVPs of Clinical Services Director of Regulatory Affairs, Legal Counsel, and representatives from Ethics, Social Work, Pharmacy, Patient Referrals, and Communications. Ad hoc members include those whose patients would be most impacted by the specific shortage. The BSMA designed by the BSTF provides a framework for TS's to conduct operational and therapeutic assessments of potential impact and defines criteria for convening the BSTF. Trigger criteria include: marked TS concern; essential product; high likelihood of inventory depletion; broad patient impact. Once convened, the BSTF is responsible for situational assessment and formulation of a management plan, with a goal of maintaining quality patient care. Conclusion: Faced with the potential for limited blood supply, the TS reached beyond the laboratory and engaged the TC and members of HCQ to assemble a robust, multidisciplinary task force. This resulted in an inclusive plan which can be activated at any time to address shortages, and assist in management of impacted patients. ABSTRACT Background/Case Studies: Cryoprecipitate (for short \"cryo\") plays a critical role in clotting and controlling hemorrhaging, and is often used in the treatment of massive trauma and major diseases, including metastasized cancers, cardiac diseases, hepatic failures, and organ transplants. The collection process of cryo is particularly challenging; due to fact to be processed into cryo units, the collected whole blood has to be shipped to the production facility and be processed within 8-hours after collection. This tight 8hour time constraint between collection and production can only be satisfied with precision collection planning and extra courier services; which makes the collection for cryo units more costly than other products. Study Design/Methods: The American Red Cross (ARC), in partnership with researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), has developed a blood collection model to increase the amount of whole blood that can be processed into cryoprecipitate. After reviewing blood collecting and processing schedules, collection locations, and other factors, ARC-Cryo subject matter experts together with GT researchers were able to analyze the problem structurally with several analytic/dynamic programming properties, and developed a near optimal solution algorithm or mathematical model. Results/Findings: To facilitate implementation, a Decision Support Tool (DST) was developed to systematize the selection of the collection sites; determining when and from which mobile collection sites to collect blood for cryo production and how to schedule the courier services such that the collection targets are met and the total collection costs are minimized.",

University of Vermont Medical Center Background/Case Studies: The shelf life of apheresis platelet (AP) units stored in plasma may be extended from 5 to 7 days in the USA using an FDA cleared rapid test (RT). In August 2016, our hospital based transfusion service began using a RT on day 6 and 7 to routinely extend AP shelf life to 7 days. This report describes changes in platelet inventory management and transfusion practice six months following routine use of 7-Day AP. Study Design/Methods: Data were obtained for two study periods: September 2015-February 2016 (pre-implementation) and September 2016-February 2017 (post-implementation). The study periods were intentionally made to span the same months of the year due to seasonal variability in platelet transfusion rates in our region. The transition period from 5-Day to 7-Day AP inventory was excluded. The following data was collected for each study period: the total number of AP transfusion recipients, AP units transfused, expired AP units, AP units ordered ad-hoc from suppliers, inpatient admissions, surgical volumes, and average length of stay. Results/Findings: Data are shown in the Table. The number of AP transfusions decreased by 3% post-implementation while inpatient admissions and surgical volume increased by 1% and 3%, respectively. The hospital length of stay was similar for both periods. AP inventory decreased by 36% post-implementation and the outdate rate decreased from 29% to 15% (p<0.0001). Ad-hoc ordering was not statistically different between study periods (p50.10). The average number of AP transfusions per patient between pre-and post-implementation periods was not statistically different (2.1 and 1.9, respectively, p50.65). Furthermore, a new \"rejection threshold\" for lipaemic products will be implemented. This threshold represents the TG concentration above which viral marker testing for donor screening will be affected. In KCBB Abbott's Prism Assays are used for: HBsAg, anti-HCV Ab, anti-HIV Ab, anti-HTLVI/II . Results/Finding: Using data management system and file records in KCBB as regard discarding blood components due to lipaemia during the last five years (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) , it was demonstrated that number of discarded RBCs due to lipaemia during the whole period was 4892 units. Number of discarded different plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate components during the last two years due to lipaemia was 8546, 24, and 2 units respectively. The mean number of discarded RBC units of the five years of the study exceeds 50% of the tested ones.",

We outline our approach and address issues we faced during the first 4 months of PR-SDP availability. Study Design/Methods: Our nursing education team provided presentations to the nursing and clinical unit support staff. A company-sponsored trainer staffed sessions for the evening/night shifts on the clinical wards. Presentations to physicians were made by the blood bank medical staff. Information Technology personnel created a new product type in the blood bank computer system, tested the ABO/Rh truth tables, and ensured that billing codes were in place. The necessity for transiently supporting a dual inventory of PR-SDP and conventional platelets led to consultation with the ethics committee and risk management, to confirm that PR-SDP and conventional platelets (C-PLTs) tested for bacteria (\"safety measure\" testing) could both be considered the hospital standard of care. We chose to not gamma irradiate any unit of PR-SDP, consistent with the package insert. Results/Findings: The ethics committee and risk management confirmed that informed consent was not needed for transfusion of PR-SDP. PR-SDP available from our blood supplier incremented monthly. Over the first four months of PR-SDP availability, 777 PR-SDP were transfused at our hospital (out of a total of 3286 platelets transfused). After 4 months of scale-up, PR-SDP were approximately 30% of inventory. Questions received during the nursing and medical conferences related to: the risk of bacterial contamination with C-PLTs vs. PR-SDP; toxicology of the PR process; scanning PR-SDP labels into the electronic medical record; and the need to irradiate PR-SDP. Our use of a \"safety measure\" addressed concern over bacterial contamination of C-PLTs. Published PR-SDP toxicology data comparing the content of psoralens in food products such as grapefruit ($12 mg per 100g) to the content in PR-SDP (<1 ng per mL) addressed toxicology concerns. Nursing/IT allayed concern over scanning issues with a simple demonstration. Finally, we ensured that all parties were aware that FDA did not require irradiation of PR-SDP. Presentations at the medical conferences were also used as an opportunity to provide transfusion-transmitted disease training and information on platelet utilization. Company personnel did not present at medical or nursing conferences per institutional policy. No Background/Case Studies: Ensuring platelet supply capability represents a challenge in terms of donor recruitment and inventory management operations. In September 2017, the apheresis collection process (ACP) was completely revised to increase the number of products per donation by maximizing the rate of double-platelet donations (DPD). The process review has led to several changes, including the substitution of the pre-donation platelet (PLT) count measurement before donation type allocation, in favor of the use of the donor's past donation records. Multiple processing steps were eliminated, and the evaluation of PLT concentration as a function of time, deduced from complete blood count (CBC) measurements, allowed the centralization of the analysis at the QC Department. Finally, introducing the concept of non-optimal donations has led to an increase in the proportion of DPD. Study Design/Method: At the donation centers, whole blood (WB) from 10 donors was collected in K 3 EDTA tubes. PLT concentrations were determined at the QC Department using the Coulter AcT 5 diff hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Sample tubes were stored at 20-248C and measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-collection. Single platelet donations (SPD) or DPD were collected using the Trima Accel. Units were pooled and split in ELP (Extended Life Platelet, Terumo BCT) storage bags to mimic SPD (250 mL; n58) or DPD units (500 mL; n54). PLT pools were stored at 20-248C under mild agitation for seven days except for DPD, which were split in two 250-mL bags after 18 6 1 h. Samples were taken on days 1 and 7. pH, pO 2 and pCO 2 , hypotonic shock response (HSR), extent of shape change (ESC), CD62p expression, ATP content, lactate and glucose concentrations were used as in vitroquality markers. Results/Finding: PLT concentration as a function of time, determined from WB CBC measurements, showed no significant difference at 24h (247 6 32 PLTx10 9 /L), 48h (247 6 27 PLTx10 9 /L) and 72h (247 6 32 PLTx10 9 /L) postdonation. DPD can be stored in the same collection bag for 24h after donation without any significant impact on PLT quality markers. PLT concentrations were within the manufacturer's acceptable limits (1141-1526 PLTx10 9 / L) before splitting. On day 1, lactate and pCO 2 concentrations increased, and pO 2 decreased in DPD. However, these values normalize to those of control units at the expiration day. Conclusion: This project was approved by Health Canada and implemented in our organization in March 2017. There are numerous operational and cost benefits from this process optimization initiative, without significant impact on safety and quality. Post-implantation efficiency data will be compared to the targeted 12% increase in the targeted number of PLT units per donation ratio.",

Allen* 1 , Colleen Vincent 2 and Patricia Kopko 1 . 1 University of California -San Diego, 2 American Red Cross Background/Case Studies: Pathogen reduced platelets (PRP) provide improved safety compared to conventional apheresis platelets, but collection and manufacturing are complex. Early evidence shows only 40-45% of double platelet collections meet requirements for pathogen reduction treatment. 1 Blood centers need hospitals to implement PRP to start manufacturing, but hospitals may not wish to use PRP until they can provide the product to all patients. Scaling up manufacturing at the blood center and phasing in PRP across patient populations meets both parties' needs. We evaluated this strategy at our university health system (transfusion volume: 9,500 apheresis platelets annually), which includes two hospitals (750 inpatient beds) and an outpatient cancer center. Study Design/Method: Before initiation, approval and funding were obtained from the hospital quality council and administration, and stakeholder groups such as hematology/oncology were educated and consensus gained. Live training was provided for nurses in the outpatient cancer center (week 0) and the bone marrow transplant (BMT) ward (week 6). An e-mail communication explained the change to all physicians and nurses. In Phase 1, we implemented PRP in the outpatient cancer center. These patients are immunocompromised and do not have access to the immediate advanced critical care of the inpatient environment should a septic reaction occur. In Phase 2, we expanded usage to include the inpatient BMT ward. In Phase 3, we lifted all restrictions so PRP could be used throughout the health system, with the goal to reach 100% PRP within 6 months. Results/Finding: In Phase 1 (weeks 1-6), we requested 31 PRP products weekly, based on typical usage in the outpatient cancer center. Our blood supplier provided an average of 23 PRP weekly (range 9-33), and PRP constituted 44% of platelet transfusions in the cancer center. In week 2, excess PRP inventory required use of PRP in the inpatient BMT ward ahead of schedule, a practice which continued throughout Phase 1. In Phase 2 (weeks 7-8), we formally expanded issuing of PRP to include the inpatient BMT ward and requested 91 PRP products weekly. Our blood supplier provided an average of 57 PRP weekly (range 44-69), and PRP constituted 53% of platelet transfusions in the phased-in areas. In Phase 3 (weeks 9-10), we began issuing PRP throughout the health system. Our supplier provided an average of 70 PRP weekly (range 61-78), and PRP constituted 43% of all platelet transfusions. Scaling-up is ongoing. Conclusion: Phased implementation of PRP by patient group prioritizes patients who stand to benefit most from the product, and allows time for the blood center to scale up manufacturing. ",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Maintaining adequate inventory of platelets without significant outdating and waste of product is a constant challenge for many institutions, especially for smaller community hospitals. Our Health System comprises 21 hospitals including smaller community hospitals (SCH) and larger tertiary care medical centers (TCMC). For several years, we have been using a limited internal process of platelet sharing between some of our institutions to successfully reduce platelet wastage. This encouraged us to analyze platelet usage throughout our health system and devise an expanded novel concept of platelet distribution, in partnership with our blood supplier that would allow us to maintain an inventory of 2 apheresis platelet (AP) units at our smaller community hospitals without significantly increasing platelet waste and the associated cost. Study Design/Methods: A \"Round Robin\" (RR) transportation system for platelet delivery and pick up was strategically developed with the regional blood center to align with routine delivery of red blood cell (RBC) standing orders. An efficient delivery system was implemented so that the regional blood center would realize reduced supplemental and emergency deliveries of blood components to our hospitals. Platelets are transferred at the time of RBC standing order delivery based on a predetermined route schedule. Each day, 2 AP are delivered to the SCH and the previous day's platelets retrieved (if not transfused), packed in blood center transport boxes, and then picked up by the blood center driver. These platelets typically have a 48 hour shelf life remaining. The same process occurs at the next SCH on the route. All retrieved platelets from the SCH are delivered to the TCMC which is the last stop on the route. Thus, the SCH has adequate number of units available for regular transfusion and massive transfusion protocol. Results/Findings: Review of our RR process revealed a significant benefit to our smaller community hospitals as we were able to routinely maintain an AP inventory for patients requiring urgent platelet transfusion. An additional benefit was further decrease in AP waste (Table 1 ) resulting in a cost savings of $50K. An additional cost savings of approximately $25K was noted due to decreased cost of emergent platelet transportation. Conclusion: Our novel RR process of platelet distribution has resulted in improved platelet availability at our smaller community hospitals while maintaining the reduced level of AP waste at our health system from our previous platelet sharing process. We anticipate additional decreases in AP waste as 237A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 we further streamline our process. With the trending merge of health delivery systems, we predict that other health systems will adopt similar processes to improve platelet availability and reduce waste.",

As with any process change, adjustments and modifications can occur along the way. After implementing 100% Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) for Apheresis Platelets, we made two additional adjustments to our sampling processes to ensure accurate labeling/categorization/branding of our final products. Study Design/Method: Our PRT Validation consisted of 100 Apheresis platelet products. Each product was tested pre-processing for white blood cell (WBC) content and platelet yield, along with post processing platelet yield. This data was used to calculate our yield and volume retention during processing. We anticipated products with preprocessing yields of 3.0, 3.1, and 3.3 x10 11 may end up below a 3.0 in the final storage bag and would need a post-processing sample to ensure the product met criteria at !3.0x10 11 platelets. Results/Finding: During the validation, we discovered one collection was not leukoreduced and two collections started at a 3.4 yield but ended with a yield below 3.0. These two discoveries led to adjustments in our PRT platelet process. With the WBC failure, we reviewed the WBC count on the Sysmex XE-2100D preprocessing report to see if it would alert us to a potential WBC failure. The review discovered that 99 of 100 results were 0.00 or 0.01x10 3 / mcL with the exception being the WBC failure with a count of 0.29. Further monitoring of the WBC counts discovered a result of 0.04 which was tested on the ADAM r-WBC for WBC count and determined to not be leukoreduced. We decided all Sysmex WBC results from the pre-processing Sysmex report would be reviewed prior to processing and a WBC result of 0.03 will be tested on the ADAM to confirm a leukoreduced product. We also discovered 2 of 4 (50%) of the 3.4 preprocessing yields products ended with a post processing yield <3.0. We decided to increase the yields requiring post processing samples to include the 3.4. Conclusion: We are continuing to sample all collections for a post processing yield so we can be confident that we are releasing products into inventory with a yield of !3.0x10 6 platelets and to have enough data to accurately determine our volume and yield loss during processing ",

UKMC is KBC's largest consumer of blood products. As platelet usage can vary widely day to day platelet usage projections are provided to KBC by the UKMC blood bank, thereby allowing KBC to act accordingly with a given day's stock (i.e. import vs export). Daily platelet projections are based on phone calls asking clinicians working in high-demand locations to estimate their needs. This process can be easily confounded by multiple factors and has undergone multiple adjustments to improve its accuracy. Study Design/Method: Daily platelet projection forms from 9/16-12/16 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to actual usage data over that same time. The prediction system used in the UKMC BB up to that time (estimated clinical need 1 6) was evaluated for effectiveness based on: total number of days under-predicted, number of days with large underprediction, average number of units under-predicted, and average difference between prediction and usage. The prediction system was subsequently changed based on this data in 2017; the revised prediction method (estimated clinical need 1 11) was then evaluated retrospectively using the same data sources covering 1/17-4/17 and then compared to the prior method. Results/Finding: The average number of platelets transfused from 9/16-12/ 16 was 18.2 U/d with a standard deviation of 5.3 U/d; the predicted amount was 13.7 U/d. The difference between the predicted amount and the number of units used was -4.5 U/d. 79% days (23d/month) were under-predicted (average: 6 U/d). 17% of days (10) were under-predicted by !10 U (average: 12 U; max: 15 U (4x)).",

Conclusion: Review of clinical platelet usage over this time identified a relatively stable average daily clinical demand. Adjustment of our prediction system to ensure that no, or as few as possible, days were projected for less than that average has markedly reduced catastrophic shortages (17% a 1%), reduced the number of days under-predicted (79% a 38%), and decreased the discrepancy on those under-predicted days (5.9 U a 3.5 U). These improvements in estimating usage allow for an increased ability to handle unpredictable events without suddenly straining KBC's supply flexibility or severely limiting UKMC clinical settings.",

Background/Case Studies: On 08/26/16, FDA issued a guidance document for \"Reducing the Risk of ZKV Transmission by Blood and Blood Components\". In response, a plan was implemented for mandatory ZKV testing for all Clients with locally acquired mosquito-borne cases of ZKV within 4 weeks; nationwide in 12 weeks. This organization performs testing for Clients (blood centers, hospitals) across the country. We report on 1 of 2 manufacturers' (Sponsor) provided Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols. A single Project Management (PMO) system was used to control all required processes. Study Design/Method: Project focus included: clinical trial requirements, Client onboarding, lab operations (Labs). Our objectives were to implement ZKV testing for 44 Clients within 4 weeks, and an additional 21 Clients within 12 weeks. To minimize the impact to Labs a staggered implementation was used with tracked/streamlined communications from stakeholders: Vendors, Institutional Review Board (IRB), IT (client and lab based), Client Services and Labs. Results/Finding: Clinical trial requirements increased the complexity of implementing an unlicensed test. Documents included donor notification, informed consent, protocol training, staff certification, deviation management, and result reporting. Multiple IRB documents were required. To ensure accuracy in IND commitments a Principle Investigator was assigned to Labs with Client sub-investigators. Deliverables were multiple including Client requirements, Vendor responsibilities and Labs. Client onboarding included confidentiality agreements between Client and Sponsor. An immediate ZKV based webinar provided materials and understanding of Sponsor protocol, lab test system, and Client/donor based responsibilities. To facilitate and ensure effective communication, twice weekly conference calls were held. Clients sent questions which were facilitated by Labs and directed to Sponsor. Specific to Clients were IRB documents, IT updates/validation for ZKV test ordering and result receipt. Labs were multifaceted: vendor instruments, assay materials, package inserts, staff training. Assessments included: ZKV sample volume, throughput, instrument capability/capacity. Work requirements included Vendor installation, equipment, assay and reagent qualifications, staff training, competency assessments, result reporting. All Clients were provided with ZKV testing within required timeframes. Conclusion: The success in meeting a rapid implementation of ZKV testing was largely due to a centralized PMO system which provided a controlled process for Sponsor, Client, Vendor and Labs. Within lessons learned strength was found in a multi-Client onboarding process. A weakness was in understanding instrument test volume capacity throughput which was exceeded during the 4-week period but overcome during the 12-week cycle.",

RBCs are the component most often transfused during neonatal period. Small volume aliquots are used to limit donor exposure, prevent circulation overload and decrease donor related risk. Traceability is the ability to trace each individual unit from donor to recipient or disposal. Blood component should be fully traceable from collection to final disposition. The Kuwait Central Blood Bank (KCBB), is preparing baby units and distributing it to all hospitals all over the country. KCBB, being accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), is following the AABB's regulations in tracing every component. Study Design/Method: This is a retrospective study to assess final deposition and the percentage of discard of prepared packed RBCs baby units in the KCBB and five hospital blood banks (HBB). Also, to assess the levels of traceability as a reflection of the improvement in the efficient use of these blood products. Methods: A total of 3000 RBCs baby units were randomly chosen to be traced to their final deposition from the year 2012 till 2016. Half of them (1500 units) were traced in KCBB. Tables showing the numbers of the chosen units were distributed to the five governmental HBB (60 units for each year of the study period). Results/Finding: Preliminary results show that the tracing of RBCs baby units in the KCBB is 100% efficient. Results from other hospitals are under process. Statistical analysis of the traceability will be done as soon as the data is collected.

George Washington University Hospital Background/Case Studies: Secure text messaging in hospital settings allows for quick, easy, and HIPAA compliant communication between members of patient care teams. It works on a mobile phone or computer, and provides read-receipt confirmation and a temporary record of team communications. Secure texting has potential to be a useful management tool in Transfusion Medicine in reducing blood product wastage. For example, it provides a relatively low-burden means for busy clinicians to provide feedback to the Transfusion Service about scenarios of potential wastage. This information can be used to identify areas in which management strategies could be developed. It also allows for personalized educational opportunities between clinicians and the blood bank about usage guidelines and how to reduce future wastage. The goal of this study is to use secure texting to investigate wastage, evaluate the responses from clinicians, and evaluate the potential effects on reducing wastage. It is hoped that the results will identify secure texting as a useful management tool in Transfusion Medicine. Study Design/Method: Wastage records that were investigated without the assistance of secure texting from July to December 2016 were reviewed to identify the most common scenarios of preventable blood product wastage. Wastage records from January to April 2017 were reviewed, and wasted products that were considered preventable were investigated using secure texting to communicate with the ordering physician. Results/Finding: For 2016 data, 129 units were investigated without the use of secure texting. Of these, 118 units were identified as preventable wastage, and 11 wasted units were considered beyond the control of the clinician. The categories for preventable wastage were defined as follows: 1) Product not released after procedure/ or when patient stabilized (42) 2) Product returned outside of appropriate temperature range (40) 3) Clinician unaware product was assigned (36). Thus far in 2017, wastage records have identified 31 units of preventable wastage. Secure texting was used by a Transfusion Service physician to investigate. Twelve responses provided useful feedback for future management strategies, 11 responses thanked the Transfusion Service for the information, and in 8 instances, the message was read with no reply. Conclusion: Secure text messaging has the potential to improve communication in Transfusion Medicine. It is easy to use, HIPAA compliant, and helps identify strategies for reducing wastage by improving communication and allowing personalized educational opportunities between ordering physicians and the Transfusion Service.",

Background/Case Studies: Maintaining a robust blood product supply is an essential requirement to guarantee optimal patient care for all major hospitals. However, daily blood product use is difficult to anticipate. Platelet products are the most variable in daily usage, have short shelf lives, and are also one of the more expensive products to produce, test, and store. Due to the combination of absolute need, uncertain daily demand, and short shelflife, platelet products are also frequently wasted due to expiration. Sophisticated data analysis has the potential to accurately predict hospital wide platelet needs and therefor reduce wastage. Study Design/Method: We have investigated platelet usage patterns at our institution, and specifically interrogated the relationship between platelet usage and aggregated hospital-wide patient data over a recent consecutive 29-month period. Using a convex statistical formulation, we have found that platelet usage is highly dependent on several factors. These include day of week, number of abnormal CBC, location-specific hospital census data, and other less important factors. We exploited this relationship to develop a mathematical model to guide collection and ordering strategy. Results/Finding: This model minimizes waste due to expiration while never allowing for a shortage; the number of remaining platelet units at the end of any day never drops below 10 in our model. Compared with historical expiration rates during the same period, our model reduces the expiration rate from 10.5% to 3.2%. With an annual platelet usage of approximately 13,000 units, this reduction equates to approximately 950 units saved from expiration annually. Depending on platelet pricing in different regions, this accounts for annual savings between $450,000 to $650,000, per institution. Conclusion: To our knowledge our research is the first such use of hospital wide data to inform real-time donor recruitment strategies based on anticipated patient demand.",

If collected in a functionally closed system, it may be relabeled as Thawed Plasma (TP), extending expiration to 5 days from the thaw date. Although coagulation factor levels decrease over this period, they remain above hemostatic levels. As TP can be safely used for the vast majority of patients requiring coagulation support, we implemented use of TP in our multi-site tertiary care system, with the aim of decreasing costs and minimizing wastage. Study Design/Methods: The massive transfusion protocol at our instiution already allowed the use of group AB TP. Following a review of literature and practice at other large centers, the Transfusion Committee extended the approval of TP to all patients. Neonates (<4 months), patients undergoing plasmapheresis and those with factor deficiency or other disorders for which We also noted a significant decrease (not quantified) in technologist time and effort, as less time was expended on the following: thawing units, printing inventory reports and reporting/record-keeping for discarded units. Conclusion: In many large facilities, providers frequently order more plasma units than are ultimately transfused, leading to high plasma wastage rates due to limited (24 hr) shelf-life. TP has an extended shelf-life, and can be used interchangeably with FFP and PF24 for most patients. Implementing TP in a multi-site tertiary health care system resulted in sustained decrease in plasma wastage, saving thousands of dollars and helping conserve a precious resource.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: Immunohematology reference labs (IRLs) must maintain diverse inventory of antisera to aid in antibody identification, antigen type RBC units, and meet regulatory requirements. When our current organization was established, two IRL sites had independent inventory management systems. Although the purpose of maintaining the antisera inventory was the same, organization, storage, & access to instructions for use (IFUs) were not. Our IRL developed a synergistic method to organize and store antisera coupled with in-house designed custom Excel spreadsheet to organize and search antisera and view IFUs. Study Design/Method: A list of similarities and differences was constructed. Best practices of both methods were identified. We determined that our antisera could be broadly classified/organized into two main categories: rare and bulk for screening. Sequential lab assigned numbers were given to antiserum for each category: S (rare Sera) and B (Bulk sera). A dynamic/static freezer box storage system that was inter-box static and intra-box dynamic was determined to be best option to combine two inventories while conserving elements of each allowing for library growth. Antisera assigned to a box remained in that box, but may be moved within the box. The box itself may be moved among freezers. To track boxes, location and movement within the box, a custom Excel spreadsheet was created. Its location tracking feature allowed for two different storage methods to function in one spreadsheet. The spreadsheet had a tab for S and B antisera categories. ABO group, desired and unwanted antibodies filters allowed quick search for appropriate antisera. The spreadsheet also had hyperlinks to scanned IFUs. Results/Finding: Sequential lab S and B numbers were assigned to new additions using a dynamic/static storage system. An Excel spreadsheet with scanned IFUs (hyperlinks) was used. Pre-merger systems, it took on average 5-8 minutes to choose an antiserum and obtain the appropriate IFU. Post-merger system was reduced to on average 2-5 minutes. (Table) Conclusion: The merging of two IRL's antisera inventories resulted in a need for innovation to create an inventory management system with an advanced search function and hyperlinked IFUs. This process saved valuable technologist time and organized the antisera more efficiently. ABSTRACT continue to flash until they are removed from shelf and their status updated in our database. 'Units Allocated' tab includes truncated patient name (to protect privacy), unit number, component type, allocation and expiration date/time, and time since allocation, with a flashing alert for units expiring in < 4 hours. The XM/HLA Platelets tab provides patient names and status of units allocated. A 'TRXN/XMPLAT' tab lists pending transfusion reactions and platelet cross match reports. Dashboard eliminated the printing (several times/shift) of lengthy computer-generated reports, simplified thawed plasma inventory management and helped decrease plasma wastage (from 34% to 14%). Conclusion: Using in-house talent and minimal capital expenditure, we designed and implemented a dynamic web-based dashboard for managing blood product inventory across a multi-site transfusion service. The dashboard is stable, customizable and requires little maintenance. Initially built to optimize inventory display for thawed plasma implementation, the dashboard was expanded to include all allogeneic blood products. Over the past year, this tool has replaced manual processes for monitoring and rotating inventory and directly helped decrease plasma wastage.",

            "text": "Use of Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells for Hospital Transfusion Service Inventory Management Ronnie L. Hill*, Jason Corley and Lizabeth Ostiguin. US Army Background/Case Studies: Regional blood shortages have been documented across the United States during the winter holiday timeframe. Deglycerolized Red Blood Cells (DRBCs) have been shown to be an effective alternative though more expensive to manufacture. This study looks into the fiscal and inventory efficacy of using DRBCs to meet the needs of transfusion services during times of blood shortage. Study Design/Method: On three separate occasions, a medium sized DoD donor center used its frozen blood inventory to produce type O DRBCs to meet the needs of two regional transfusion services. All frozen red cells were manufactured by an offsite facility with the Haemonetics ACP-215 using the low glycerol (40%) freezing method and frozen at -658C within six days of collection. Thawing occurred in a 328C water bath in the following order: 7 O Positive and 1 O Negative on 3 January 2017; 7 O Positive and 1 O Negative on 7 February 2017; and 8 O Negative on 22 February 2017. Deglycerolization occurred on site using the ACP-215 with all units passing internal QC requirements. DRBCs were shipped the same day to a hospital transfusion service, allowing for 13 days of shelf life prior to expiration. Results/Finding: During the three events, all supported transfusion services and the blood center were below minimum inventory requirements for standard type O red blood cells (RBCs). O Positive RBCs were only available through NBE at $240-280 and had the limitation of arrival on the next business day. Collection and processing time of liquid RBCs takes approximately two days including: donor screening, phlebotomy, component processing, testing, and labeling. DRBCs cost the DoD on average $400 per unit to produce and distribute. DRBCs have a shorter shelf life, 14 days versus the 211 days for other RBCs, but are washed during deglycerolization and thus produce fewer transfusion reactions. One tech can operate up to four ACP-215's and deglycerolize four units at a time. In January and February 2017, it took one tech four hours per iteration of eight units to include thawing, labeling, and packing for shipment. Conclusion: While not as readily available as traditional RBCs, DRBCs can be an effective product to bridge the inventory gap when small numbers of units are needed due to reduced inventory. Collection and processing of whole blood into components takes approximately two days, but can produce greater numbers of units in that timeframe. Based on this, DRBCs can be ready faster than freshly collected units of blood. There is an increased cost associated with manufacturing FRBCs which is compensated for by the longer available shelf life of 10 years. Having a small contingency supply of frozen red cells and deglycerolization equipment has been effective on three occasions in ensuring availability of type O red blood cells for hospital transfusion services.",

This testing serves as a quality control test and helps estimate the antibody potency of the product. The Binding Site, Human Anti-Tetanus Toxoid Immunoglobulin Liquid Reagent Kit is for use on a turbidimetric analyzer. The aim was to optimize and validate the Human Anti-Tetanus Toxoid Immunoglobulin Liquid Reagent Kit for use on a photometric analyzer. Study Design/Method: Experiments were performed in order to determine the optimal amount required of reagent buffer and latex reagent from the anti-Tetanus Toxoid immunoglobulin kit utilizing the Abbott c8000 instrument. Precision of the new assay parameters was determined by testing 10 replicates of a panel of samples at three concentrations of tetanus antibody in a single testing run. The panel samples were created by spiking appropriate amount of a WHO tetanus antibody standard into Sodium Citrate plasma. Accuracy was determined by testing a series of samples ranging from 1 IU/mL to 60 IU/mL of tetanus antibody. The samples for the accuracy study were created by diluting an appropriate amount of a WHO tetanus antibody standard with sample diluent from the reagent kit. Linearity regression was determined by using the accuracy study values within the range of 2.0 to 45.0 IU/mL. Stability of samples was determined by testing samples stored at 2-8 0 C and -20 0 C in triplicate at various time intervals. Results/Finding: The %CV for the optimized anti-tetanus assay for all antibody levels determined in the precision study varied from 1.2855 to 1.3142. So, precision was acceptable since the %CV for all samples tested was 5%. The mean values for the samples tested in the accuracy study were all 610% of the expected value which was much lower than the acceptance criteria which was 615% of the expected value. The linearity of the assay was acceptable with a R2 ! 99.0%. The linearity study established that the known tetanus concentration was a statistically significant predictor of the observed concentration. The sample stability studies demonstrated the ability to quantitate tetanus antibody concentrations in samples stored up to 14 days at 2-8 0 C and up to 1 month at -20 0 C. Conclusion: The data presented shows the successful optimization of the Human Anti-Tetanus Immunoglobulin Reagent Kit for use on a photometric analyzer. Validation studies of this optimized assay demonstrate excellent accuracy, precision and linearity using samples stored for 14 days at 2-8 0 C and stored up to one month at -20 0 C.",

            "text": "A Deep Dive Audit of Intravenous Immunoglobulin Use for immune Thrombocytopenia: Is Its Use Inappropriate? Jiajia Liu*. University of Toronto Background/Case Studies: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a generally safe and effective therapy for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) but is only suggested for scenarios when a rapid increase in platelet count is desired or as first line therapy if steroids are contraindicated. Due to concerns regarding adverse effects, cost and resource availability, an IVIG request form was implemented in our jurisdiction in 2010 to track utilization and appropriateness. A recent audit of these request forms from four academic institutions found a lack of compliance with form requirements and inadequate documentation of efficacy which led the authors to conclude that the use of IVIG was broadly inappropriate (Shih et al, 2017) . As such, we aimed to conduct an extensive chart review of patients who received IVIG for ITP at our institution to assess appropriateness of use. Study Design/Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with ITP who received IVIG in our institution from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015. Local research ethics board approval was obtained. Results/Finding: 40 patients received IVIG for ITP at SMH over the study period for a total of 76 unique IVIG infusions. The most common indications for IVIG within currently accepted guidelines were: active bleeding (13, 17%), pre-operative or antepartum care (22, 29%), a platelet count of less than 10 and contraindication to corticosteroids (8, 11%). Additional indications that still fell within accepted guideline recommendations included: patients with arterial/venous thromboembolism or risk thereof requiring initiation of antithrombotic therapy; and patients requiring myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Indications that fell outside of guidelines included: use of IVIG as a diagnostic challenge where the etiology of thrombocytopenia was unclear and use prior to international travel for patients with difficult-to-treat chronic ITP despite a platelet count between 30-50 x 109/L. 6 patients received IVIG for a likely diagnosis ITP while 245A TRANSFUSION being investigated for alternative explanations for thrombocytopenia. Three patients were refractory to all other therapy for ITP and were dependent on regular IVIG infusions. 18/76 (24%) of infusions consisted of 2g/kg over 2 days; the remainder of infusions consisted of 1g/kg. Of those who received 2g/kg,3 of patients (17%) had evidence of partial remission after a first 1g/kg dose. IVIG was generally well tolerated and infusion reactions were mitigated with use of corticosteroids, antipyretics and/or antihistamines. Conclusion: We found, at our institution, that use of IVIG for ITP was generally appropriate and carefully considered even in cases that did not meet current guideline recommendations. We believe that IVIG remains an important treatment for ITP particularly in the aging population where prevalence of conditions complicating bleeding risk is increasing. Detailed utilization/ knowledge data inquiries are required to develop tools and policies to enhance appropriate IVIG use in multiple settings. We believe that there is an opportunity to promote administration of a single 1g/kg dose to minimize unnecessary utilization of IVIG amongst hematologists who manage ITP.",

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: A mission of our institution is to reduce the risk of work-related injuries. Accordingly, each year an ergonomic survey is undertaken as a component of a general Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology safety audit. Our 2016 survey identified potential musculoskeletal risks that suggested a redesign of our crossmatch benches. Study Design/Methods: A seven item ergonomics survey of the working environment was sent to 32 staff members in early February of 2017. Twenty-two technologists responded for a 69% response rate. The below table below reports the survey items and responses. Results/Findings: The most problematic area was the available workspace. Of the respondents, 81% indicated that workspace size was insufficient and 71% that the chairs at the fixed height benches were problematic. Problems noted were difficulty with climbing up into a chair and backing down and with the chairs holding the chosen height. Our laboratory Lean Team Operational Support Group was tasked to aid with the bench redesign and to choose products for improving the workspace. Our goals were to design a layout to streamline testing workflow and better utilize lab space, including our plasma thawing and sink space, eliminating dead space. The configuration of the new workspace was guided by the survey findings. Adjustable height workstations were recommended to replace our fixed height bench. We worked with our facilities design contactor to purchase adjustable benches and plan add-on cabinet shop work. The benches were assembled off site, which allowed a bench top layout to be determined and installation of cabinet shop add-ons of a drawer for supplies and a pull out breadboard as a writing surface. The opportunity to assemble off site streamlined the process of installation, resulting in minimal disruption of testing. Conclusion: The survey was effective in identifying working areas for improvement. Employee comments have been positive for the new workstations. An effectiveness assessment will follow, using the original survey, to assess the success of the project.",

Sandra Lamm* 1 , Neil Bangs 1 and Kimberly Sanford 2 . 1 VCU Health System, 2 Virginia Commonwealth University Background/Case Studies: Type and screen (T&S) testing is often ordered on patients presenting in the Emergency Department (ED). If the patient does not have a historical type, a second sample is drawn with an additional phlebotomy for type confirmation. If the patient does not need a transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), the testing and second phlebotomy is an inefficient use of resources and time. Study Design/Method: As part of a Performance Improvement initiative in Transfusion Medicine, we performed a retrospective study of all T&S orders that were initiated in the ED from 1/1/2015 to 6/30/2015 to determine if testing was subsequently followed by transfusion of blood products. Patients were stratified by ED department, time from T&S draw (TSD) to transfusion (<4 hours, > 4 hours < 24 hours), and if a second sample was required. Results/Finding: A total of 3144 T&S orders were initiated from the ED in this time period. 2787 (88.7%) patients were not subsequently transfused any type of blood product within 4 hours of TSD and 2584 (82.2%) patients were not subsequently transfused any type of blood product within 24 hours of TSD. A total of 2119 (67.3%) patients required a second sample. Of these patients requiring a second sample, 1960 (92.5%) were not subsequently transfused any type of blood product within 4 hours of TSD and 1886 (89%) were not subsequently transfused any type of blood product within 24 hours of TSD. Conclusion: Routine ordering of T&S testing is not an efficient use of resources and time as many patients are not subsequently transfused. Ultimately unnecessary T&S and second sample collection and testing for those patients not subsequently transfused within 24 hours of TSD amounted to an estimated $699,706 in unnecessary patient charges and approximately 628.7 nursing hours for phlebotomies in a six month period.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The Institute for Healthcare Improvement Triple Aim incorporates enhancing patient satisfaction by providing high quality, safe care. Towards these goals the BBTMS is charged with communicating to obstetric physicians (OBs) a patient's antibody specificity with associated hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn risk. Thus, when anti-D is detected in a female of childbearing age, it is critical to determine whether this represents Rh immune globulin (RhIG) or alloimmunization (alloanti-D). Review of a patient's electronic health record (EHR) helps quickly identify RhIG administration, but if this documentation is missing, then it is easy to assume presence of alloanti-D. RhD alloimmunization impacts mom, fetus, newborn and future pregnancies. Therefore, without a national, comprehensive health information exchange (HIE) system, it is imperative to investigate beyond the on-site EHR whether a patient received RhIG at an outside hospital (OH). We report an IRB approved (exempt) case series where detective work revealed RhIG administration at OHs. Study Design/Method: Over a two month time period, anti-D was identified in four pregnant women. Review of their EHRs did not reveal a history of ABSTRACT RhIG administration; nor did subsequent direct communication with their obstetricians (OB) reveal a history of RhIG. Based on each patient's home address, the BBTMS of any nearby OHs were contacted as was a primary care physician if listed in the EHR. Results/Finding: Investigations beyond the EHR and OBs revealed each of the four patients received discontinuous prenatal care with presentations at multiple sites. Through phone calls to the BBTMS of OHs, a history of one or more RhIG administrations within the preceding three months was found for each patient. Our BBTMS records and EHR were amended to reflect the presence of a passive anti-D due to RhIG, rather than alloanti-D. The changes were also directly communicated with the OB caring for each patient. Conclusion: When a new anti-D is identified in a pregnant female, investigation is required to determine whether it is passive RhIG versus alloanti-D. When neither the EHR patient history or OB reveal a RhIG history, it remains in the patient's best interest to investigate further. Through phone calls to OH we revealed a history of RhIG administration in four patients. Finding and communicating this critical information helps enhance the quality and safety of patient by ensuring subsequent RhIG administrations when indicated, at our institution. Future strategies for avoiding similar situations include expanding our national HIE for critical information such as BBTM history and allergy history and expanding use of wallet-size patient identification cards with RhIg and alloantibody histories.",

Aronson* 1 , Elizabeth Halperin 2 , Sharon Breining 2 and Mona Papari 3 . 1 ACL Laboratories/ Advocate Hospitals, 2 Advocate Health Care, 3 ITxM Background/Case Studies: A large Midwest hospital system with 5 Level I trauma sites evaluated how to audit the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP). The possibility of real time audits is impractical due to the unpredictability of these events. A search of the internet found an example from New Zealand for post process evaluation. This was shared with a team as a starting point and then adjusted for system specific priorities. To start the audit, the initiation of the MTP needed to be determined as events are often started as a verbal request but then followed up with either downtime or computer orders. Study Design/Method: The Transfusion Service (TS) was determined to be the source of truth for all of the MTP events. A tracking sheet was created to capture the patient demographics, start and stop time, number and type of products issued and wastage. This was then passed onto nursing quality staff that used the tracking form and the patient chart to enter an event into the error management data base as a focused event. The focused event was built to include patient demographics and other information from the tracking form as well as where the event was called (Surgery (OR), Emergency (ED), Labor and Delivery (L&D), etc.), type of event, use of tranexamic acid (TXA), calcium chloride (CaCl), temperature monitoring and pre/ post lab results. A trial was started and 3 months of data were evaluated that contained 29 events. Results/Finding: There was an equal number of events that were initiated in the ED and the OR (12). Male patients were involved 69% of the time and 31% of time the patients expired. Trauma of some type was the majority of the cause but 13.8% of the cases involved GI Bleed and only 6.9% were obstetric cases (see chart). The lowest hemoglobin (Hgb) was found to average 7.1 with the post Hgb average of 9.7. Ratios of 1:1 for Red Blood Cells (RBC) to plasma as well as RBC to Platelets (PLT) and Cryoprecipitate (CRYO) were also determined with a target of 4:1. It was found that the RBC: plasma was 1.9:1, RBC: PLT was 5.9:1 and RBC to CRYO was 7.4:1. Use of TXA was only 24.1% and CaCl was utilized in 58.6% of cases. Conclusion: Although this data is for a short period of time it has pointed out several opportunities for improvement. The use of MTP in GI cases was not previously understood but opens up a new group of people for which education and understanding of the MTP process is needed. The low use of TXA needs to be evaluated and already has started conversations about how this drug should be stored and accessed for the MTP process. The product ratio numbers were suspected of being off but now that data is available, it is much easier to speak to this issue and look for improvement. The process will now be expanded to the Level II trauma sites in the system and routine evaluation will be shared with all sites.",

Norcross, GA). The ECHO Operation Manual in Chapter 12-6 and Appendix D it states: \"Warning: The Galileo ECHO cannot reliably detect hemagglutination reactions that are graded as 11 or less in tube methodology. The Galileo ECHO does not generate as interpretation of mixed-field. Such a mixed-field reaction will be interpreted as positive, negative, or equivocal.\" We report of a challenge with this analyzer limitation which impacts the assignment of the correct blood type for multiply transfused SCD patients. Study Design/Method: Two SCD when initially tested by the ECHO as O, D Negative; however, each patient was historically O, D Positive. Both patients had received a RBC exchange transfusion with 8-11 O, D Negative red blood cells over 30 days previously. Repeat testing of the samples was completed by the VISION (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. Raritan, NJ), NEO (Immucor. Norcross, GA), and by standard ABO/Rh manual testing (anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D Series 4, Anti-D Series 5, A1 cell and B cells. Immucor. Norcross, GA). The repeat testing was compared to verify the patient's ABO/Rh typing and the results were entered into the computer system to allow for assigning the patient's ABO/Rh typing and electronic crossmatch. Results/Finding: Table 1 summarizes the initial and repeat testing with the two patient samples. Although the ECHO failed to interpret or flag the blood type as mixed-field, the other methods identified the transfusion of O, D Negative blood with the detection of mixed-field in the D typing or by failing to interpret the ABO/Rh as not type determined (NTD). The VISION and manual ABO/Rh typing yielded the easiest mixed-field to interpret macroscopically. Conclusion: Our results agree with the findings of Summers et al (TRANS-FUSION 2009; 49:1672 -1677 who reported the challenge detection of mixed-field with the use of the ECHO compared to improved detected with automated gel column agglutination. When the samples were tested by multiple automated and manual ABO/Rh methods, the expected mixed-field was detected. The failure of the ECHO to detect the mixed-field is acknowledged by manufacturer, but there is a risk that a facility may mistype the ABO/Rh when there is not a historical ABO/Rh to compare. To avoid this risk, it may be appropriate to re-type first time SCD patients by other methods rather than the ECHO to avoid this challenge. Consistent with Summers do not account for regional distribution. Many large hospitals acting as regional hubs for redistribution may appear to have optimized inventory based on ODR and BSR, but we hypothesized that these are crude key performance indicators (KPIs) requiring redevelopment. Study Design/Method: KPI redevelopment occurred in a large tertiary care hospital blood bank in Canada, responsible for 75% and 20% of transfusions in the region and province respectively. RBC supply, inventory, and disposition data were retrospectively assessed from February 2014-June 2015 as the baseline period. A \"demand-driven inventory planning policy\" (DDIP) was instituted to assess and implement the optimal RBC reorder quantity based on the difference between the historical maximum and minimum RBC inventories during weekdays; that would not lead to blood shortages. Shelflife inventory (SLI) was chosen as the main surrogate marker for the assessment of efficiency of the supply chain process, calculated by the differences between age of blood transfused (ABT) and received (ABR). Iterative simulation modeling (R statistical software) was then performed to optimize SLI in a post-implementation period from June 2015-October 2016. Results/Finding: Modeling predicted observed RBC disposition. Through simulation, optimization of SLI was found to occur by optimizing a set of KPIs for each ABO blood group (Table 1) . This led to a reduction in observed overall SLI (7.2 6 1.8 days vs 6.0 6 1.5 days, p<0.01) and ODR (0.9% vs 0.5%). The BSR was not significantly increased during the postimplementation period. Conclusion: Optimization using simulation modeling of multiple factors other than BSR and ODR led to further efficiency gains in a large tertiary care hospital blood bank. Hospital blood banks should use an integrative approach with a set of KPIs to optimize the supply chain. This approach requires validation in other blood banks and jurisdictions. (6)) requires that the hospital make reasonable attempts to notify the patient (or the patient's physician), counsel the patient, and offer testing. The hospital must maintain records of this Lookback notification as part of the patient's medical record. Paper records of Lookback notifications are less accessible than electronic records and are at greater risk of being damaged or lost. To facilitate the Lookback process and reduce paper documentation we sought to use the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to perform and document notifications. Study Design/Method: Representatives from Transfusion Medicine (TM) and Information Technology (IT) worked together to define minimum and optimal EMR solutions. Minimally, a completed paper packet could be scanned into the EMR. This solution had no advantages in terms of ease of use, process control, or transparency. Desired optimal functionality includes the ability to send letters in the EMR, document control so that original communications may not be altered, opportunity for patient's physician to electronically sign and return responses, letter and form templates that can be individualized, and the ability to track when and by whom notifications were sent and received. The EMR system at our institution, Epic (Epic Systems Corp., Verona, WI), has a function called \"Letters\" with the capacity to do all these tasks. A series of five templates were developed: HIV and HCV letters to physicians, response forms for physicians to return to the transfusion service, and a blank letter template to be used for specially tailored letters. Templates are opened within the patient's EMR and demographic information is automatically populated by Epic (eliminating many possibilities for clerical errors), the blood product transfused (e.g. RBCs or plasma) is selected from a drop-down menu, and the date of transfusion is manually entered by the sender. The completed letter is then routed to the patient's physician; it shows up automatically (and instantly) in their electronic In Basket as well as in the patient's EMR. Physicians may electronically complete and return the response form within Epic, or print it and return the form by fax.",

Conclusion: The data analyzed demonstrates that the majority of surgeons are adhering to our institutional MSBOS guidelines. It was noted that surgeons are requesting products be issued for invasive procedures where rapid exsanguination is possible. Our analysis revealed that the hospital's MSBOS does allow for an excess in blood ordering for some surgical procedures. The MSBOS should be updated to reduce the suggested maximum product order. In general, the data does not imply that the blood product wastage in the OR is due to the ordering practices of the surgeons. A larger period of surgical blood ordering practices should be analyzed to detect blood product ordering, utilization and wastage trends in other subspecialties. Background/Case Studies: The VisionV R and VisionV R Max (Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan New Jersey) are ID-MTS TM Gel card-based automated immunohematology analyzers marketed for small to medium, and high-volume [> 50 type and screens (T&S) per day] blood banks 1 , respectively. Our laboratory which serves a large 1278-bed multispecialty academic hospital and receives 275-300 T&S specimens per day needed to replace three ProVUE analyzers prior to the availability of the VisionV R Max. We implemented three VisionV R analyzers to work with our existing NEOV R and ECHOV R (Immucor Inc, Norcross Georgia). A recent multicenter field application trial of the VisionV R reported a mean turnaround time (TAT) for T&S and ABO, Rh typing (ABO/Rh) of 32.2 6 4.5 and 27.5 6 5.6 minutes 2 , respectively. The objective of this study was to determine VisionV R TATs under routine daily high-volume practice. Study Design/Methods: One VisionV R was in operation during a five-week period (phase I), and then two additional analyzers were brought into service (phase II). TATs are defined as the time when the order is received by the instrument to when the test is completed and available for review. Three-cell screen and ABO/Rh TATs, and number of VisionV R antibody panels were collected for a nine-week period. The TAT for the screen was used as the TAT for the T&S because the screen is the rate determining step. All testing was performed using in-service analyzers on routine patient samples by trained technologists. Samples were not deliberately batched but were placed on the analyzer based on the volume and flow of work at the time. Results/Findings: Under the high volume conditions of our laboratory with three VisionV R analyzers, the mean T&S TAT was 30% longer and had a larger standard deviation (S.D.) than the published trial result of 32.2 6 4.5.",

This research compares the responsiveness of the FDA during West Nile Virus (WNV) and Zika Virus (ZIKV) outbreaks to evaluate our current preparedness. Study Design/Methods: The literature review was conducted to analyze FDA's response time during the WNV crisis and determine if it was effective and efficient. The research survey was performed to determine if the Donor History Questionnaire (DHQ) adequately screens donors for ZIKV as the sole preventive method (as per the February 2016 Guidance for Industry: Recommendations for Donor Screening, Deferral and Product Management to Reduce the Risk of Transfusion-Transmission of Zika Virus) and to determine if the current regulatory practices (including the August 2016 Guidance for Industry: Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Zika Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Components) are perceived to be effective and efficient in the face of the current ZIKV outbreak. Survey Monkey was used and participation was anonymous. Over 4,000 emails and web-links were sent to members of AABB, SCABB, SEABB, and personal network with a 10% target response rate. Participants self-selected or deselected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in the consent letter. Results/Findings: The literature review revealed that the FDA's response was slow during the WNV outbreak, while the ZIKV response is efficient thus far. A total of 317 participants responded to the survey (7.94% response rate). Statistically, participant agreement with FDA's decisions was performed by \"t\" test (with n-15317-15316 df) of the null hypothesis that the mean50 vs. the alternative that the true mean is> 0. Overall participants had favorable opinions of the FDA's decisions. Statistically, whether participants in different levels of the demographic variables (region, profession, and years of experience) answer significantly differently, one way ANOVA models were used with Likert-scale question responses as if they were continuous. The F-statistic and P-value are for the null hypothesis that all levels of the explanatory variable have the same mean for the response variable. There were no significant differences in the years of experience and profession variables for participants. Region was determined to be unreliable due to undefined states for each region listed.

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: When evaluating a new instrument solution for pre-transfusion testing, it is important to consider the operational impact of the system on the lab. There are a variety of operational, performance and system metrics that can be evaluated to determine this impact including: test workflow, hands on time, and automation time. Study Design/Methods: The study involved a current state to a future state comparison of testing processes with an instrument ORTHO ProVueV R (PV) and manual testing vs. an instrument ORTHO VISIONV R (OV). Data collection methods included direct observation, time studies, and interviews. The PV bench performs Type & Screens (TS) on the PV and manual AbID/selected cell panels in the gel test. All other testing; cord blood(CB), DAT, unit confirm(UC), patient type confirm(PC) and crossmatch(XM), etc. are done manually in tube. The future state incorporated the OV. TS, AbID and UC were evaluated in both states. Cycle time(CT) was averaged based on 3 run cycles. CT was comprised of 3 metrics; instrument time(IT), standby time(ST) and labor time(LT). ST may be comprised of 2 components, time that could be utilized as \"walkaway\" time or vigilant time (VT) which requires operator presence but not operator action. For automated instruments, VT for each cycle was measured as instrument access unavailable. Instrument daily maintenance (DM) CT was evaluated as well. Similarly, timing of manual tube test processes used these metrics. For repetitive activities within a process, such as UC or XM, a time per individual process was captured and then multiplied per unit. Results/Findings: Table 1 provides details about the metrics of current state and future state processes. Tube based test timing is as follows: PC (2:50), XM (32:23), CB (13:18) and DAT (10:00). By implementing the future state, an average $1.3 min. LT and VT is saved on each sample loaded for TS equating to a 73% labor reduction over the current state. A 19% improvement in TAT on the TS was achieved in the future state. Moving from manual AbID to automated processing resulted in a 59% LT reduction. On average, a 38 min. continuous walk-away time is achieved for each automated AbID. UC had less impact on labor time with minimal difference however allowed for focus on consistency and quality metrics. Conclusion: Based on the metrics evaluated and compared between current state and future state, the OV has demonstrated improvement in lab operations to both the labor required and result TAT delivery. Opportunity exists to automate workflows on other tests that are still manually performed. Background/Case Studies: High throughput and efficient automation of serologic tests is crucial in the workflow of a blood bank that tests $100 type and screen samples per day. The ErytraV R (Grifols) is a fully-automated walkaway analyzer utilizing 8-column gel cards for pretransfusion testing. The blood bank validated and implemented the use of ErytraV R for ABO/D typing, antibody screening and identification of patient samples as a replacement for a solid phase testing platform. The blood bank also validated automation of donor unit retypes. The instrument has bidirectional interface to the blood bank lab information system (LIS), HCLL TM (Hemocare Life Line, Mediware). Instrument validation and implementation were done in conjunction with the software version upgrade of HCLL TM and an interface system change to Maestro TM . Study Design/Method: Correlation testing of the ErytraV R results with the manual tube testing (PEG IAT; reference method) was performed on 100 patient samples for ABO/D typing and antibody screening; of which at least 10 had a positive antibody screen. Out of the 10, 5 had known antibody specificities. Forty-two RBC units were also tested for ABO/D confirmation; of which 17 were D(-) and 25 were D(1). Calculations of concordance, sensitivity, and specificity were performed. Precision studies were also done. Interface testing of ErytraV R , HCLL and the hospital's information system using the Maestro TM interface system was performed and validated. Results/Finding: Concordant results between both methods were obtained in all of the 100 patient and 42 donor samples tested (100% concordance). All 10 samples with positive antibody screens were obtained by both methods. All clinically significant antibodies were detected by both systems. ErytraV R gave 100% sensitivity and specificity. The precision studies showed that both methods gave the same type and screen results for 5 samples at 3 different testing events. After validation of the LIS upgrade and interface system change, a bidirectional interface with HCLL TM was established. The instrument has been operational in our lab for over 3 months. Conclusion: ErytraV R was found to be reliable and accurate and can handle the high workload of our lab. Users found the instrument easy to use; hence training, proficiency, and competency of the users are achievable and manageable. The validation of the the instrument is straightforward. The major challenge and delay in the implementation experienced by this blood bank were attributed to the concurrently occurring LIS upgrade and migration of the data integration system. A post-implementation workflow assessment would be ideal to perform to ensure that the instrument is being used at its full potential.",

This must be assured while minimizing outdating of scarce and expensive blood components -an inherent challenge with platelet units which have a short 5-day shelf-life. We report the results of a quality improvement project implementing a custom computerized Platelet Inventory Report designed to mitigate the most common cause for platelet wastage at our institution: high platelet outdate rates. The report includes blood type, product code, unit number, respective product attributes, supplier and availability status of all platelet units for each hospital location. All system blood banks receive a morning fax of the report which facilitates transfer of units prior to expiration and adjustments are more readily made for product orders to the supplier. Study Design/Method: The study was conducted in the hospital-based blood bank and based on available platelet inventory and wastage quality data. The report went live October 2014 and quality data was reviewed from August 2013 to December 2016. The collected data was then analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results/Finding: Data from 2016 indicates platelet wastage comprised 1% of total received platelets and 79% of these wasted platelet units were due to expiration. Other reasons included failed visual inspection, blood dispensed but not used and wasted on the floors, potential tube station problems or short-dated units transferred into our blood bank from another facility. The mean of monthly wasted platelet units 12 months preimplementation of the report was 13 units, compared to 11 units 12 months post-implementation and 5 units 24 months post-implementation. Wastage rates improved from 6% (wasted yearly platelets/total received yearly platelet units) in 2014, the year of report implementation, to post-implementation rates of 3% in 2015 and 1% in 2016 (see table) . Importantly, this occurred despite a greater than 30% increase in platelet inventory between 2014 and 2016 and resulted in cost savings of over $60,000 in this period. Conclusion: Study limitations included restricting data collection to one campus. The option to transfer expiring platelet units to another blood bank was available to all 4 participating sister hospitals. It would have been interesting to see the effect of the report on those hospitals which have lower transfusion rates and different ordering practices. Aside from lowering platelet wastage within 2 years of implementation, additional benefits to the report included facilitating ordering from the blood supplier. Cornerstones of a successful inventory management plan include daily inventory monitoring and, ideally, coordinated system-wide efforts to share platelet units. We have shown achievement of this end is facilitated by a customized daily Platelet Inventory Report -an efficacious and easily adaptable tool with demonstrable gains.",

The Transfusion Lab's (TL) management team and Medical Director met with Emergency Department (ED) leadership and IT resources in 2014 to define the needs of a successful electronic blood transfusion system. The handwritten order forms had several potential error sources which could lead to a delay in filling the order pending correction (in the best of circumstances) or could lead to transfusing the wrong patient or the wrong product if the error was not detected. The potential error sources included clerical errors involving the patient's name or medical record number (MRN), writing two different names on the order form (because there were two locations to record patient name), two product types ordered on one form when the requirement is for one product type per order, no priority indicated (STAT or Routine), or not including the prescriber call-back information. The number of ED reported transfusion related events in 2013 and 2014 were 63/1187 (events/ED transfusions 2013-2014). Study Design/Method: Electronic ordering for the ED was implemented March 31 st 2015. Any transfusion orders generated from the ED are now electronic, unless in the case of electronic downtime. The system electronically fills in the patient's name and MRN, controls for the type of blood product being ordered, requires an order priority and provides service contact information. It was designed to accommodate transfusion ordering needs for adults, pediatric patients <35kg and pediatric patients >35kg. 252A TRANSFUSION orders had three critical fields identified that are required for the order to be processed including patient weight, product volume, and infusion rate. The electronic system was designed so that an order cannot be submitted unless all critical fields are completed. Results/Finding: The electronic ordering system has been in place for 2 years (April 2015 -March 2017), and during that time there was 1 instance of blood being ordered for an unintended patient 0.09% (1/1081). This was because a previous patient's medical record was accessed rather than the intended patient's medical record. There have been no instances of clerical errors (name misspelled or MRN transposition etc.), missing service contact information, missing order priority information, more than one product type ordered on a single order, or two patient names on one order. Electronic ordering also provided a place for the transfusionist to chart against, leading to increased transfusion documentation compliance. Prior to electronic order implementation, in 2013, 17/651 (2.61%) units were transfused in the ED but not charted in the patient's medical record. In 2014, 18/536 (3.36%) transfusions were not charted. However, in 2016, the first full year of electronic transfusion order capability, only 4/462 (0.87%) transfusions were not charted in the patient's medical record.",

These calls not only occupied valuable time but also made the lines unavailable when a real emergency occurred. The Hospital is categorized as a Level 1 trauma center, with over 700 inpatient beds and over 50 operating rooms. A proposal to implement a Blood Bank automated attendant was recommended to decrease phone calls, minimize errors due to distraction from phone calls, free team members to perform other duties and have a direct line designated for requesting trauma coolers, massive transfusion protocol (MTP) and emergency release of blood products. Study Design/Method: The first step was to categorize the types of phone calls received by the Blood Bank by creating a phone log. Data were collected and analyzed for four weeks. The blood bank collaborated with nursing, hospital administrative staff and telecommunication team to evaluate the possibility of implementing an automated attendant to minimize phone calls. It was very important to maintain patient safety and quality of service at the same time. The automated attendant consist of: Option 1 (Urgent) for trauma, emergency release, MTP and obstetric hemorrhage emergency release; Option 2 (Verbal) for verbal orders and coolers set up; and Option 3 (Staff) to speak with staff member. Instructions were also given for specimen inquiry and product availability in the hospital information system. Results/Finding: The data in Table 1 showed that most of the incoming calls fall into three categories (specimen inquiries, product order inquiries, and other inquiries). Most of the calls were from nursing staff inquiring about the length of wait time for blood products and specimen availability. There was an overall decrease in phone calls by 68% with the implementation of an automated attendant.",

Additionally, type & screen results were compared to patient's historical records; the specimen was retyped by a second technologist if historical results were not available. The BBID bands were prone to clerical errors and excessive specimen rejections, and believed to miss some WBIT errors. In 2015, Blood Bank accounted for 48% of all rejected clinical laboratory samples, yet comprised only 5% of total laboratory volume; 88% of rejected Blood Bank samples were due to BBID band issues. The WBIT error rate detected by BBID-based system was 0.006%. Study Design/Method: A multidisciplinary workgroup was formed to review data and best practices. The decision was made to discontinue BBID bands and implement a two-sample verification process, in keeping with Standards.",

Providers are prompted to order the ABO verification test only when no previous ABO/Rh typing results are found. Education was provided to all clinical staff in the form of in-services, emails, and annual competencies completed electronically. The new process went live in September 2016. Results/Finding: In the five months following implementation, four WBIT errors were detected with the second sample. These may have been missed using the BBID band system. Improved detection revealed a WBIT error rate of 0.128%, three times the national average of 0.043%. Under the new system, rejected Blood Bank samples decreased from an average of 50% to 28% of all rejected laboratory samples, a 43% decrease. Implementation of the new process produced a net savings of $55.8K. Conclusion: Replacing the BBID band system with two-sample verification successfully improved our ability to detect WBIT errors among patients who lacked historical blood bank results. Additionally, discontinuation of the BBID system decreased the incidence of clerical errors and unnecessary specimen rejections, and also saved money for the organization. Next steps are for Blood Bank and Laboratory Quality leaders to partner with nursing leadership to drive down WBIT error incidence. 253A addendum with the final culture results. We used a student's t test to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the mean TAT for result addendum entry in the post-implementation period compared to the pre-implementation period. Results/Findings: In the pre-implementation period, we cultured 19 residual products for suspected STR. The TAT for final culture result entry into the patient's EMR was 5-78 days (mean 19 days, SD 20). In the postimplementation period, we cultured 22 residual products for suspected STR. The TAT for final culture result entry into the patient's EMR was 5-12 days (mean 7 days, SD 2; p50.0082). There were no positive cultures during either study period. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that TAT for documentation can improve with the use of information technology to notify the Transfusion Medicine physician when results are available for documentation in a patient's EMR.",

The current target for this institution's blood bank is an 80 minute turnaround time (TAT). In April of 2016, the blood bank was forced to move to a temporary location due to building construction, which necessitated a switch from automated solid phase methodology to manual gel method. The average number of outliers increased 104%. TAT analysis of a representative one week sampling per month showed an increase in outliers from 28 per month to 57 per month. Average monthly TYS samples performed is 2758. These numbers did not improve even upon returning to the original facilities. Study Design/Method: Two Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VisionV R Analyzers (Raritan, N.J.) were purchased for the blood bank. The instruments were set up with a bi-directional interface allowing for samples to be continuously loaded without manually ordering the tests. Batch testing was eliminated allowing samples to be run as received. The results were auto interpreted, and transmitted to the laboratory information system (LIS) based on predetermined rules. Only results in need of manual review or interpretation were held back. Final verification of results was performed by the technologist within the LIS. Reagents and other needed consumables could be preloaded on the instruments eliminating the need to repeatedly load consumables with each sample run. Key quality indicators including TAT continued to be monitored throughout implementation. Data was monitored for significant changes and improvements in patient care. The go-live date was 12/20/ 2016. Results/Finding: The average number of outliers decreased 61% from 57 per month to 22. Further benefits include a reduction in the number of technologists needed to perform TYS testing. Additionally, reduced waste due to better utilization of supplies by the instruments along with less repeat testing has resulted in projected cost savings of $134,000 for fiscal year 2017. Conclusion: The use of gel technology, in combination with a two way interface and a continuous load instrument can result in a significant decrease in TAT over manual gel method.",

These cultures are reported in our Cerner operating system but those results do not cross over to the patient's EMR . The finalized product culture results are entered into the patient's EMR as an addendum to the transfusion reaction clinical note. A review of the Transfusion Reaction database revealed that there were occasions when the final product culture results were not entered into the patient's EMR in a timely manner. It is important to the patient's care for the Transfusion Medicine Service and the patient's primary provider to know if a transfusion reaction is related to a contaminated product or the patient's general overall health. This information is also crucial to the supplier of the product to determine if others have received components of the affected unit and to possibly determine if there are any quality control issues at the donor facility.

Study Design/Method: The project was separated into three parts. In the first part, data on transfusion practices was retrospectively collected over a four month period on the oncology unit. The variables collected included date and time of transfusion, pre-and post-transfusion hemoglobin, patient diagnoses, and whether or not blood was ordered to be irradiated and if so, whether or not irradiated blood was issued by the blood bank. All patients with hematological malignancies and all patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy were candidates for irradiated blood. The second part of this project was an educational intervention. Residents, oncology floor nurses, and blood bank staff were given lectures on the importance of transfusing irradiated blood on the oncology floor. Residents were also instructed to order irradiated blood for all patients on the oncology unit. In the third part of this project, repeat data was collected over a two month period to assess whether the intervention was successful. Results/Finding: Pre-intervention, 67 units were transfused on the oncology floor with 38 units (57%) requiring irradiation and only 22 of those 38 units (57%) ordered as irradiated.

Using a balanced 6:6:1 transfusion ratio (TR) for massive resuscitation is recommended based on trauma data. Objective performance during Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) activations is poorly studied and there may be differences based on site or medical service of MTP initiation. With the impending release of a unified, redesigned Exsanguination Protocol (ExP) at our institution, we established baseline performance characteristics for our existing MTP and Obstetric Massive Transfusion Protocol (OBP). Study Design/Method: Following Institutional Review Board approval, we performed a retrospective study on blood product utilization and outcomes of MTP and OBP activations from July 2015-December 2016. Data were manually collected from transfusion service paper records, electronic (Safe-Trace) records, and an automated data report from the electronic medical record (Epic). Conclusion: We observed considerable variability in transfusion practices during acute hemorrhage depending on the service and location of activation. Trauma activations demonstrated the sharpest deficit in platelet transfusion, whereas all groups lagged somewhat in transfused plasma relative to packed red blood cells. LOS and mortality varied among groups, likely reflecting underlying medical conditions and indications for massive transfusion. We have identified an opportunity for improvement in MTP transfusion ratios observed in trauma cases, the specific environment from which the 6:6:1 ratio was derived, and in which the impact of protocol-driven blood resuscitation is most efficacious.",

BB specimens are unacceptable when they are unlabeled, unsigned or missing necessary documentation. In such cases, a new specimen is requested to be drawn as per protocol. Our investigation of unacceptable specimens previously included generation of a report by the blood bank staff that was subsequently submitted to the BB supervisor for completion. Following completion, the report was sent to the Nurse Manager of the patient care unit (PCU) for follow-up and investigation with the staff members involved. This process was cumbersome, taking a few days before the staff member of the PCU was alerted to the deviation in protocol. At times, residents or float staff involved were difficult to identify and it was often challenging to track down the staff and do the necessary investigations and in-services. Study Design/Method: In June 2016, a Patient Identification Improvement Strategy was implemented jointly by the department of nursing and the BB to address mislabeled, unlabeled and unsigned specimens as part of a Patient Safety Initiative. Currently, following this strategy, when an unacceptable specimen is received, the Nurse Manager (NM) of the PCU is immediately notified by BB Staff. The NM promptly initiates a debrief process with the staff involved in drawing the specimen. A debrief form (tool) was created to guide the discussion. This process is followed 24/7. The NM will also engage other available staff in a huddle to review the incident and reinforce the policy. The debrief form is then submitted to hospital QA and the BB with preventative actions included. We believe in using the JUST CULTURE MODEL to help us understand the reasons why the staff did not label the specimen according to policy. Just culture helps promote shared accountability to ensure we have the proper systems and processes in place to deliver high quality care. Results/Finding: The table below represents the percentage of unacceptable specimens identified by the BB since the second quarter of 2016. The implementation of this new process has led to a decrease in the number of unacceptable specimens up to 30% quarterly following its implementation. The opportunity for direct intervention by the NM with the staff involved has risen from 75% to 96%, due to the immediate debrief process. ABSTRACT Conclusion: The Patient Identification Improvement Strategy allows for real time engagement of the BB and PCU staff to promptly investigate and institute corrective/preventive actions when there is a deviation from policies related to specimen collection. The heightened awareness of correcting patient specimen labeling errors can only improve patient safety and the patient experience.",

Therefore, PTx are commonly guided by local institutional recommendations (IR). The aim of this study was to determine the degree of adherence of PTx practice to IR at a pediatric tertiary institution. Study Design/Method: Retrospective review of PTx practices including transfusion thresholds, responses and dosages were collected. Platelet counts within 24 hours pre and post transfusion were evaluated. Patients (0-18 years) receiving prophylactic PTx from July to December 2016 admitted to the oncology acute care unit with diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma were included. For prevention of volume overload, the IR for PTx were < 10ml/kg for patients < 35kg and one apheresis unit (AU) for patients >35kg; therefore, patients were separated into 2 groups: < 35 kg and > 35 kg.",

This study demonstrated that there were still considerable deviations from IR in PTx practice among pediatric oncological patients. In addition, the false assumption that a higher dose will yield a better response can put patients at increased risk for transfusion related adverse events.

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: Our institution provides the option for presurgical samples (PSS) to be drawn up to 56 days prior to surgery as long as the patient reports not being transfused with a blood or blood component containing allogeneic red cells and they have not been pregnant in the preceding 3 months from the date of PSS collection. When PSS patients returned for surgery, the patient's service was required to ask the patient again about their transfusion and pregnancy history to determine if there had been any new opportunities for allogeneic red cell exposure, however, there was no process to capture the information the patient reported for the time between the PSS draw to the day of surgery/possible transfusion. Study Design/Method: An electronic fix was designed that was applied to the surgical intake process. A new set of questions was added to the A.M. Admit questionnaire that must be completed prior to the patient's surgical procedure. The questions ask the patient if they have been pregnant or transfused in the preceding three months and if the answer is affirmative, the computer system runs a blaze rule causing an alert in the blood bank. The blood bank techs review the alert and inactivate the patient's PSS based on the new transfusion/pregnany information. One year post-implementation of the electronic fix, Transfusion Lab performed a retrospective review of all PSS alerts generated during a three-month period. Results/Finding: The results of the review were analyzed and are displayed in the Table. It was determined that only 2.1% of patients with a PSS Alert had an active sample requiring inactivation.",

Of these Alerts, it is estimated that approximately 68 patients (17x4) per year are identified as no longer eligible for PSS status. Once this retrospective review was performed, it was shared with the project stakeholders to determine if the electronic questionnaire could be further tailored to patient's based on age, gender, and PSS status. While the benefit of having fewer false positive PSS alerts (97.9%) was recognized as an ideal future state, it was not compatible with the institution's current IT project of implementing a new Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. The safety enhancement provided by the current electronic fix will remain as is and the improvement suggestions were shared with the team creating the parameters for the new EMR with the intention of targeting only patients with an active PSS in the blood bank, rather than all surgical patients. Weill Cornell Medicine, 7 Columbia University School of Medicine Background/Case Studies: Blood ordering is a complex, high-risk process with multiple steps that have the potential for errors and delays. Risks associated with this process, from ordering through pick-up, require evaluation and strategies for mitigation. Given the complexity and high-risk nature of blood ordering a proactive risk assessment (PRA) for blood product ordering using the FMEA methodology was conducted. The goal of the project was to proactively assess the effect of a redesigned electronic order set on the quality and safety of blood ordering Study Design/Method: To evaluate the electronic blood ordering redesign process, a PRA was completed using the FMEA methodology. The team identified each step and sub-step of the electronic blood ordering process, all failure modes and causes, and then scored each by severity occurrence and detectability to determine the Risk Priority Number (RPN). All RPNs with a score above the threshold were reviewed and rescored based on mitigation strategies designed to address the failure mode. Results/Finding: The group scored the identified failure modes by categories used in root cause analyses. The electronic blood order process has internal logic and alerts that improve communication and reduce the risk score. Several mitigation strategies that will reduce the risk of the identified failure modes include type and screen status within the RBC order, streamlined alerts when the order does not meet the laboratory threshold, a nursing task list for transfusion, and a change to the pickup process that is linked to the product ready status in the laboratory information system. A transfusion history will be available to providers when ordering blood products to further reduce communication risks.",

The Blood Bank at Rhode Island Hospital, a level 1 trauma center and teaching hospital associated with Brown University, was originally designed to accommodate tube testing by all technologists. The original setup of the lab was split into three sections allowing for preparation and issuing of units in the first section, bench testing in the second, and the receipt of components in the third. As technology changed, the blood bank adopted first the manual gel station and then the automated gel system (Ortho ProvueV R ) but did not adapt the space. The second section of the blood bank contained the manual and subsequently automated gel stations with no other changes. The process of sample receipt through completion of testing and issuing of units remained segmented and inefficient. The average TAT for type and screens was 80 6 32 minutes. Study Design/Method: The Blood Bank design was remodeled to make for a more open concept to allow for collaboration amongst technologists as well as the best use of space and technology. The first section of tables were removed and replaced with a center console to allow for movement about the entire front of the laboratory. A wall was constructed to separate the main work flow, automated gel testing and issuing units, from the area for complicated workups and inventory receipt. The third section remained, but was repurposed for teaching medical technology students and residents. In addition to the remodel, the blood bank retired the Ortho ProvueV R for the Ortho VisionV R , which is considered a true continuous feed machine. Although the inter-device TAT is not significantly different (30 minutes for the ProvueV R and 28 for the VisionV R ) the VisionV R is built with a scheduler that effectively handles the system and processes samples efficiently. The VisionV R is also equipped with two centrifuges to process samples, which further reduces TAT when multiple samples are onboard. A bi-directional interface was designed to allow for test orders (type and screens) to go to the VisionV R and test results to go directly from the VisionV R to the LIS without the need to manually order the tests or transmit the results. Data on TAT were collected and analyzed using independent t tests and chi square. Results/Finding: The mean TAT pre-and post-reconfiguration and implementation of the Ortho VisionV R and a fraction of samples with TAT over 90 minutes are shown in the table.",

            "text": "Background/Case Studies: The type and screen (T&S) is a fundamental laboratory test that allows the blood bank to provide compatible blood for patients. Despite this, erroneous blood product administration may occur as much as 1 in 19,000 blood transfusions. To prevent errors, adequate specimens such as those lacking hemolysis and those with proper specimen labeling are necessary; otherwise the specimen is rejected, leading to a second blood draw and a delay in medical/surgical management. Hemolysis rates for T&S specimens are reported to be as high as 25% prior to interventions, but may potentially be reduced to as little as 1.5%. However, there is little published data on non-hemolysis-related type and screen rejections. An initiative was undertaken to reduce the rejection rate in the blood bank to a sustained rate of <5%, with a particular emphasis on non-hemolysisassociated forms of rejection. Study Design/Method: A root cause analysis (RCA) was performed over the preceding 6 months to obtain a baseline understanding of the errors involved. T&S submission at our facility involves standard completion of the specimen label plus completion of a unique witness form to confirm the identity of the patient from whom the specimen was collected; specimen and witness form must be submitted simultaneously. When a specimen was rejected, we recorded the patient name, medical record number, and the reason for rejection. Following RCA, an intervention was created to resolve the most common issues documented that resulted in rejection. Approval for the intervention was granted by the Department Chair, Transfusion Committee, Forms Committee, and the Medical Executive Committee. After implementation, prospective data will be collected for several months in the same manner as before to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Results/Finding: Over the study period, the T&S rejection rate averaged 8.2%. Reasons for specimen rejection were divided into 5 groups: 1) hemolysis, 2) blood bank witness collection form errors, 3) quantity not sufficient, ABSTRACT 4) duplicate sample, and 5) specimen tube labelling errors. The highest percentage of rejections was due to improperly-filled witness forms (Table 1) . After multiple form redesigns and approval by appropriate committees the new form was implemented. Preliminary data collected thus far demonstrates a 6.8% rejection rate with only 1 rejection relating to witness form errors. Conclusion: Rejected T&S specimens are an impediment to safe clinical care as it may delay medical/surgical management. Rejection rates could be reduced through simplification of blood bank specimen collection forms. Care providers have multiple tasks that need to be performed in a short amount of time, therefore, simplification is often times necessary to reduce human error. Future quality initiatives will aim to simplify complex healthcare processes without compromising patient care.",

This system is used to test whole blood donor samples for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) RNA, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA and West Nile Virus (WNV) RNA. Technician related failed testing runs can cause the laboratory to report results outside of the contractual 10-12 hour turnaround time. Failed runs also cause retesting which increases reagent utilization for the system. Currently 42% of whole blood donor testing turnaround time delays are due to issues and failed runs on the s 201 system and we have 3 technician related failures per week. A Lean Six Sigma approach for process improvement was utilized to identify root causes and develop countermeasures in order to decrease the number of technician related failures on the s 201 system. Study Design/Method: The number of technician related failed runs on the s 201 system were tracked from 10/11/2015 thru 12/11/2016. A Pareto chart was used to determine that technician related errors was the largest controllable factor causing run failures. The 5 Whys were performed to determine root causes of technician related failed runs. A Gemba walk was performed on all of the lab testing processes to help identify areas for improvement. The process Improvement team talked, met, observed, and worked directly with staff that operate the s 201 system. Roche was also contacted to provide guidance on how to help decrease technician related failures. Results/Finding: The main root cause determined was that there was no current process flow map for whole blood donor testing using the s 201 system. Counter measures implemented included creating a two phase process map. One phase was related to the processes related to start-up of the system and the second phase was related to the processes involved in processing of samples. Roche provided a job aid for the technicians which provides clear steps technicians should take when handling and cleaning up crashes and failed runs on the s 201 system. After counter measures were implemented, the number of technician related failed runs decreased from 3 to 1.2 failures per week, which was a 58% decrease. Conclusion: A Lean Six Sigma approach for process improvement was utilized to identify root causes and develop countermeasures in order to decrease the number of technician related failed runs on the cobas s 201 system. This lean six sigma approach and counter measures significantly decreased the number of technician related failed runs by 58%. patients who were transfused for pre-transfusion hgb >7g/dl with resulting post-transfusion hgb >9g/dl were reviewed. Demographics, medical history, provider identity, indication and transfusion complications were abstracted & compiled individually by 11 volunteer internal medicine residents. Group discussion for each case ensued before determination of transfusion appropriateness occurred. Principal investigator/attending physician then made final determination of appropriateness of RBC transfusion. Results/Finding: 265 patient charts were reviewed. 91 were excluded for bleeding and cardiovascular instability. 106/174 (60.9%) were determined to be transfused inappropriately. There was no difference in appropriateness of transfusion with respect to age or sex. Patients with solid tumors (76.19% vs 55.73%, p50.0181) and anemia of chronic disease (76.47% vs 54.1%, p50.006) were more likely to be inappropriately transfused. Patients who had higher pre-transfusion hemoglobin were more likely to be inappropriately transfused (median hgb 7.7 g/dL vs 7.3 g/dL, p<0.0001). Inappropriately transfused patients also had higher median post-transfusion hemoglobin (9.9 g/dL vs 9.4 g/dL, p<0.0001). Moreover, lab evalutions revealed association with lower folate levels (median 8.1 nmol/L vs 15.7 nmol/L, p50.029). 29/106 (27.3%) patients were inappropriately transfused at least in part because they received more than one unit without an interval hemoglobin check in between. 7/64 providers were responsible for 32.3% of all inappropriate transfusions. 1/68 appropriately-transfused patients experienced an FNHTR. 3 deaths unrelated to transfusion occurred (1 in appropriate, 2 in inappropriate group). Conclusion: Physicians in training are interested in promulgating optimal RBC transfusion practice. This study identified patient factors (such as solid tumors and anemia of chronic disease) that correlate with a higher likelihood of receiving an inappropriate transfusion. Beyond CPOE, educational intervention at individual level should be designed for specific providers responsible for more inappropriate transfusions.",

Luigi Sille* 1 , Willem Martin Smid 2 and Ashley John Duits 1 . 1 Red Cross Blood Bank Foundation, 2 Sanquin Consulting Services Background/Case Studies: An important tool for complying with GMP quality standards is the effective use of a blood bank information system (BIS). Validation and implementation of a BIS is described for centralized large blood bank and literature and guidelines are lacking for the nonautomated small scale blood bank environment. . Small-scale blood banks face specific challenges for computerization in relation to economies of scale and existing processes requiring special attention. For the introduction of a BIS at the blood bank of the Dutch Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao a specific procedure was designed based on existing guidelines and adapted to the local setting. Study Design/Method: The Red Cross Blood Bank Foundation Cura\u00e7ao is the sole provider of labile blood components for the Dutch Caribbean islands of Cura\u00e7ao, Bonaire and Sint Maarten. After selection of the BIS provider for implementation ISBT and BCSH guidelines for validation of information systems in blood establishments were carefully analyzed to prepare the design of local procedures. These procedures were meant to evaluate and validate the features of a BIS (e-Delphyn, Hemasoft America, Miami, USA) before introduction. The outcome of the approach was entered in worksheets that were evaluated by the implementation team and management. From this the implementation plan was designed and implemented. An external auditor (Sanquin Consulting Services, Amsterdam, Netherlands) was invited to evaluate the implementation and validation plan and its practical implementation. The evaluation was performed according to risk assessment of critical process steps. Results/Finding: Based on the ISBT and BCSH guidelines a process flow chart describing the relevant phases and critical steps for introduction and validation of a BIS was designed. Comparison of the current processes and procedures were compared to the BIS characteristics making use of 8 worksheets. With these worksheets the existing gaps with the BIS procedures were carefully described. These gaps and the appropriate procedural changes for BIS or blood bank were effectuated.",

Commercial remote blood fridge packages are available but have large upfront and maintenance costs. We implemented a remote blood fridge directly in our Emergency Department (ED) using an under counter fridge requiring ID access, and a selfdeveloped IOS application that scans, tracks and real-time alerts Transfusion Service (TS) to products used and to whom they were dispensed. Prior to ED fridge implementation, RBC units were verbally requested and an ED blood runner would pick up and return the cooler. Given that our ED is located in a separate building from the TS, this meant 10 or more minutes may be required for transit of units often released in less than 5 minutes. The net effect was that providers would routinely order products to ensure they were at the bedside for patient arrival as a precaution, only to return them when not required. Implementing a blood fridge at bedside resulted in the predicted outcome of delivering emergency release RBCs more quickly, with the observed benefit of decreasing wasted staff time. Study Design/Method: The remote blood fridge was implemented in July 2016. Data for RBC requests in coolers, RBC returns and RBC transfusions from the ED was collected and compared. Baseline data included January 2015-June 2016, and post change included August 2016-December 2016. July 2016 data was excluded as it included both the pre and post processes. Results/Finding: Baseline data shows that the ED requested an average of 99 RBC/month in coolers. Post change this dropped to 62 RBC/month, thus less blood was requested from the transfusion service in coolers as units were being used from the fridge. Baseline data also shows that an average of 54 RBC/month were returned (55%). Post change, the average RBC/ month returned was 27 (44%), this represents an absolute 50% reduction in number of returned products. Each RBC dispensed and returned takes approximately 20 minutes to complete paperwork and transport, therefore this change saved an average of 540 minutes per month. It was also noted that the average RBC/month transfused was 44 for baseline and 57 post change. This confirms that the decreased requests and returns were not due to decreased patient volume or severity. The fridge was also successful at decreasing delivery time of blood to patient bedside, as baseline delivery time of 15-20 minutes (estimated) was reduced to 3-5 minutes. Conclusion: Implementing a remote blood fridge and moving blood access closer to patient bedside ensures a faster delivery of blood to the patient. This change has an additional benefit of decreasing wasted time, and hence cost, by decreasing unnecessary product requests and returns. Implementing a blood fridge can also be done at a reduced cost through homegrown processes. Transfusions are everyday procedures and over 250 Patent-applications have been filed related to \"Transfusion Medicine\" and over 400 related to \"Transfusion Alarm\", during the last 30 years, employing numerous technical settings, aiming to support automated supervision of the mentioned actions. The aim of this contribution is to present a developed low-cost real-time individual Intravenous Blood-Transfusion monitoring system, based on the Internet of Things. Study Design/Method: The designed system is based on a commercially available Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera, employing an 1/4 inch color CMOS Sensor, providing effectively 1.0 MP, a 3.6 mm Lens, IR-cut, Day/Night Minimum Illumination 0.1 Lux/F 1 and 808 Viewing Angle.",

Recent changes in the CLIA quality control guidelines and AABB accreditation program will require additional quality control of manufactures media that is both lot specific and shipment specific to ensure recovery of bacterial growth. A study was conducted using commercially prepared organisms evaluating both a comprehensive organism panel as well as a streamlined method utilizing only two organisms from the panel. Study Design/Method: The general protocol consisted of three replicates each of each organism inoculated into two lots each of BPA and BPN by two different analyst. The study was two part in that Aspergillus brasiliensis, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sporogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were prepared from BioBall SingleShot (30 CFU), MultiShot 550 CFU or HighDose 10K organism preparations at a low level (< 50 CFU) and evaluated on the same day of preparation as method validation. The second part of the study utilized Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus prepared and frozen at a higher level and then evaluted over a 14 day study as a stream line approach to routine quality control testing of the BacT/ALERT culture bottles. Inoculation preparations were enumerated in duplicate to confirm the level at each inoculation time point. Inoculated BPA and BPN bottles were loaded into the BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection system at 36 C for automatic monitoring of growth. Negative BPA and BPN bottles were included in duplicate at each day of testing. Results/Finding: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptoococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii were positive in both the BPA and BPN culture bottles. The aerobic Aspergillus brasiliensis, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew and were reported positive in only the BPA aerobic culture bottle as expected. While the obligate anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes was positive only in the anaerobic BPN culture bottles. Bacterial cultures were positive in the BacT/ALERT BPA and BPN bottles < 1 days and the fungal organisms in < 2 days. The overall agreement was 99.8 % in 698 bottles tested here. No significant differences were observed in the time to detection between the different lots or between the different analyst. Conclusion: The BioBall prepared organisms demonstrated a reproducible method as both a comprehensive and streamline approach for the quality control of BacT/ALERT BPA and BPN culture media. The method was simple and did not require additional microbial preparations or storage of live organisms by the laboratory.",

            "text": "Use of an Electronic Patient Identification System for Blood Banking Specimen Labeling Found to be Superior over Historical Armband Approaches Annie Newton* 1 , Diane Schafer 2 , Debra Brown 1 , Jesse Cox 3 , Scott Koepsell 3 and Sara Shunkwiler 3 . 1 Nebraska Medicine, 2 The Nebraska Medical Center, 3 University of Nebraska Medical Center Background/Case Studies: Anticipating the implementation of the new (30 th addition) AABB standard concerning the confirmation of patient ABO blood typing of Type and Screen (crossmatch) specimens performed prior to the issue of crossmatched blood products, laboratory and organizational leadership evaluated the practical application of an electronic patient identification system to label blood bank specimen collections versus the traditional use of blood bank armbands. Continued use of the armbands would require a second sample for ABO confirmation of patients that did not have a historical blood type on file. Concern was raised regarding the amount of increased workload of staff and delayed results availability based on the number of increased specimens that would be generated, as well the potential for increased iatrogenic blood loss and patient dissatisfaction. Moreover, 2 nd sample collection alone would not improve the rate of mislabeled specimens observed, which is of supplementary concern. Study Design/Method: Current organization employment of an electronic patient identification system for the labeling of other laboratory specimen collections made it feasible for applying this technology to the blood bank as well. An in-depth evaluation, including a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) spanning several days, was completed to ensure that the use of the electronic system would produce comparable or superior safety results to its armband counterpart. An alternate process for specimen labeling and ABO confirmation (which would satisfy the new standard) was established to support care areas that did not have the capability of using the electronic system. Extensive education was provided to all staff (physicians, advanced practice providers, phlebotomist and nurses) to ensure comprehension as well rational for the new process. Alerts were congruently built into the electronic health record (EHR) to supplement any information regarding crossmatch testing expiration that may not be readily available by the elimination of the armband use. Results/Finding: Within days of implementing the new process (September 11, 2016), there was a noticeable reduction in the amount of mislabeled blood bank specimens received, totaling 4 in 6 months post implementation compared to 144 in the 6 months prior. In addition, the vast majority of specimens received into the blood bank are henceforth collected and labeled using the electronic system and thus have reduced the amount of potential 2 nd specimen collections needed for ABO confirmation. Conclusion: Use of an electronic patient identification system for labeling blood bank specimen collections in lieu of traditional blood bank armbands has proven to improve patient safety and department efficiency by substantially reducing the occurrence of mislabeled specimens and negate the need for 2 nd specimen collections, reducing potential iatrogenic blood loss and improving patient satisfaction. Background/Case Studies: Based on a few small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the late '90s and in early 2000, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) use has been suggested as a potential treatment to avoid exchange transfusion (ET) for Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). This treatment modality is now routinely used for Rh-HDN and has been extended to HDN caused by ABO incompatibility or by other red blood cell antibodies. However, larger RCTs performed since 2010 have shown that prophylactic IVIG did not reduce the need for ET, the duration of hyperbilirubinemia, the maximum bilirubin levels nor the need for top-up red blood cell transfusions. The primary objective of this study was to describe the usage of IVIG for HDN at a tertiary academic referral hospital. Study Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all neonates who received IVIG for HDN in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2016. Data collected included patient demographics features and diagnosis, indications for IVIG, neonatal laboratory results, treatment details, adverse events and patient outcomes. Results/Findings: Ninety-seven neonates received IVIG during the study period: 57% were female and 7% were less than 34 weeks of gestational age. None had co-existing G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency or spherocytosis. All neonates received phototherapy prior to IVIG treatment. Indications for IVIG were ABO-HDN (41%) and Rhesus-HDN (59%). Antibodies most often implicated in Rh-HDN were anti-D (22/57), anti-D and anti-C (22/57) and anti-c (5/57). Sixteen infants with Rh-HDN had received intrauterine transfusions. The mean cumulative dose of IVIG was 1 g/kg (range from 0,3 g/kg to 3,8 g/kg). Neonates received one to four IVIG administrations. Table 1 shows the number of patients receiving IVIG during two time periods. Three adverse reactions were noted during IVIG administration: cutaneous rash, hypotension and fever. Of all neonates, 14 required an ET for Rh-HDN and 3 for ABO-HDN. Forty-five (46%) patients needed top-up transfusions during hospitalisation and until three months of age: 8 with ABO-HDN and 37 with Rh-HDN. The mean number of transfusions was three (range:1 to 7). Conclusion: Although initially described for RH-HDN, ABO-HDN is now one of the most frequent indications for IVIG in neonates. The optimal use of IVIG in ABO-HDN needs to be better characterized. Our study shows a wide variation of IVIG dosing and a significant proportion of neonates requiring top-up transfusions. Further research is required to evaluate whether anemia in ABO-HDN might be exacerbated by hemolysis from IVIG isohemagglutinins and if it is dose-dependent. Background/Case Studies: Background: One of the most serious adverse reactions to transfusion is the development of graft versus host disease. Symptoms include the development of a characteristic cutaneous rash, enteritis often resulting in watery diarrhea, elevated liver function tests and ultimately pancytopenia. The clinical course is rapid with an over 90% case fatality rate. The patient population at risk is reasonably well-defined including patients who are immunocompromised due to disease process or therapy, the fetus and low birth-weight neonates, recipients of HLA-matched cellular blood products and the recipients of cellular blood products donated by blood relatives. The basic etiology of TA-GVHD is the inability of the transfusion recipient to mount an effective immune response against donor T-lymphocytes. Treatment options for TA-GVHD are ineffective, making it imperative that cellular blood components be irradiated prior to transfusion which virtually eliminates the risk of the complication. Study Design/Methods: Most transfusion service information systems have mechanisms to alert transfusion service staff to patients who have been previously identified as needing irradiated blood components. However, if these patients are not identified to the transfusion service at the time of the initial hospital visit or the time at which the qualifying diagnosis, these patients can erroneously receive non-irradiated blood components. Following a \"near-miss\" situation, our hospital information department developed a 4-part program to minimize the risk that the transfusion service is not notified of patients newly requiring irradiated blood components. Results/Findings: Our blood products ordering system has been redesigned to include 3 specific queries to identify those patients who required irradiated cellular blood products. First, physicians have been notified to include the need for blood product irradiation in the patient Problems List. Once this is included in the list, the transfusion service will be notified of the need for irradiation on all subsequent transfusion orders until the Problem List is modified by the clinical staff. Second, if irradiated blood components have ever been requested on a patient, an alert will be generated for the ordering physician even if the requirement for irradiated products has not been included in the problem list. Finally our system will automatically default to request irradiation on all cellular products ordered for children less than 4 months of age to comply with local irradiation policies. Conclusion: We believe that our approach can be further enhanced by including a list of specific diagnoses typically requiring blood product irradiation within our computer algorithm. We believe that this list will provide an additional level of safety in insuring that patients receive irradiated blood components when appropriate.",

UCSF Health Background/Case Studies: Our tertiary-care transfusion service routinely issues blood products in validated coolers to high acuity areas such as ORs, ICUs, Cath-Lab, etc. Coolers are also used for emergency release and massive transfusion protocols, and for shipping products between our different hospital sites. A robot that can hold one cooler delivers products to locations not served by the pneumatic tube. On average, 30 coolers are issued every day. Cooler set-up is a multi-step, labor-intensive process. Transfusion Service staff track cooler location and elapsed time-in-use and notify clinical teams to return/recharge coolers to avoid product wastage. We developed a lab information system (LIS)-based solution to manage cooler labelling and tracking more efficiently. Study Design/Method: Nine cooler test batteries were built; the batteries for RBC, plasma, platelet and cryoprecipitate (2 each) are identical, whereas the final battery designated for the cooler delivered by robot (containing plasma and RBCs with variable expiration times) is slightly different. The second battery in each pair was built to avoid duplicate test cancellation by LIS when a second cooler (for same component type) is being set up for the same patient. Each battery consists of tests capturing the following information: cooler location, cooler ID, number of units issued, and expiration. Custom barcodes representing each test battery and 45 different locations can be scanned from a 'quick-pick list', avoiding need for manual entry. When coolers are returned, a final entry is made in the test battery, updating LIS. A dynamic cooler tracking dashboard with live-feed from LIS displays data captured in the test battery. Elapsed time, starting from cooler set-up (which is identical to time cooler battery is ordered in LIS) is captured automatically. Color codes alert users to coolers that have less than 1 hour before expiration. A flashing alert pops up for coolers that have expired. Results/Finding: We replaced our manual process (hand-write patient information and expiration time on 2 separate tags; affix one tag to cooler and retain second one to track cooler location and expiration) with a novel LIS-driven labeling and tracking system. Each time a cooler is set up, a test battery is ordered and resulted in LIS by scanning the related custom barcodes. A single LIS-generated label is printed and attached to each cooler. Cooler expiration is defaulted to 10 hours (per our current cooler validation) from the time the test battery is ordered during cooler set up. Techs pay attention to expiration of each product they place in a cooler. If an individual product outdates before the cooler expiration time, this information is entered in the test battery and gets displayed on the dashboard as a cooler expiration time, distinct from the system-driven countdown. Color-coded visual display and alerts greatly simplify cooler monitoring, and the elimination of some manual steps has improved staff satisfaction. Conclusion: Using LIS for cooler set-up and deploying a linked dynamic dashboard to display cooler locations and expiration time makes cooler management more efficient. These tools reduce manual steps and decrease likelihood of wastage by aiding cooler tracking. ",

RBC transfusion is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. RBC transfusions have decreased but remain one of the five most overused procedures in hospitals. Real-time data on who orders transfusions, patient identifiers, units requested and hemoglobin (Hb) triggers are captured in laboratory (lab) systems. Electronic records include data on the impact of interventions e.g. anemia management (AM), restrictive transfusion (RT) and antifibrinolytics on RBC transfusion frequency. Evidence-based practice recommendations can help labs work effectively with ordering physicians to reduce RBC transfusion. Study Design/Method: METHODS: The CDC-LMBP Systematic Review A-6 Method was used to search for studies of effectiveness on RBC transfusion reduction in PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL from 1990-2016. Unpublished data were requested from clinical sites in 2013. Population: Adult patients for RBC transfusion. Interventions: AM; RT; computerized physician order entry/clinical decision support systems (CPOE/CDS); Audit/Feedback (AF) and antifibrinolytics. Control: Standard Practice Outcomes: Percentage of patients and number of RBC units transfused. Exclusions: Pediatrics, obstetrics, trauma and genetic diseases. Results/Finding: RESULTS: One hundred sixteen of 2073 studies met criteria for quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis. Nine published and one unpublished study showed that AM reduced the number of patients (OR 5 0.525); and RBC units transfused {Standardized difference in Means (SDM) 50.746}. Nine studies and three labs reduced RBC units (SDM5 -0.409) and percentage of patients transfused (OR5-0.586) with Hb alerts in CPOE/CDS. Twenty-three studies favored RT (OR5-0.363) in percentage of patients and RBC units transfused (SDM 5-0.447).",

Blood Center of Zhejiang Province, Key Laboratory of Blood Safety Research, Ministry of Health Background/Case Studies: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched unrelated donors is increasingly being used all over the world. Common protocols for HSCT with unrelated donors preferably include patient and donor matching at 10 out of 10 possible alleles at the HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 loci. Currently, HLA-DPB1 is commonly not being taken into consideration for donor selection. The impact of HLA-DPB1 mismatches after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains controversial. Study Design/Methods: 106 individuals (53 pairs of unrelated donor-recipient) who underwent unrelated allogeneic HSCT with a 10/10 HLA allele matched donor from Sep 2012 to Apr 2015 in Zhejiang province were included in this retrospective analysis. The genotyping of HLA-DPB1 for all the samples was performed by PCR-SBT method according to the previous report. Results/Findings: Among 106 individuals (53 pairs of unrelated donorrecipient), 14 different allotypes were detected and HLA-DPB1*05:01 was the most frequency allele with the frequency of 0.3821\u00a3:followed by HLA-DPB1*02:01 and HLA-DPB1*04:01.

The facility reported no known antibody history and no recent transfusions. Antibody detection test was positive using GEL technique. The sample was referred to the Immunohematology Reference Laboratory (IRL) for antibody identification and 2-unit crossmatch. IRL records indicated the patient has a history of anti-E. Antibody identification revealed a new anti-M. Auto control and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) were negative. Crossmatch compatible, E-, Munits were provided for transfusion. The next day the hospital reported a transfusion reaction. The patient's temperature, blood pressure and respiration all increased. Hemoglobinuria also reported. Study Design/Methods: Antibody identification performed using tube technique with Gamma LO-ION TM (Immucor, Inc., Norcross, GA). Reactions read at RT, 30 minutes at 37C and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) using antihuman globulin (AHG).

The samples showed weak hemagglutination reactions (21) with anti-D clones TH-28/MS-26, MS-201 and MS26 and were negative with the anti-D IgM clone P3x61. Cloning and sequencing revealed two variants with allele combinations that were not previously described. One donor was found to be weak D type 38 (RHD*c.833G>A) in cis with a hybrid exon 5 (RHD*D-CE(5)-D) and in trans with the RHD*950delA in exon 7. The other donor presented a new c.325A>G base change in RHD exon 2 encoding p.Thr109Ala in the transmembraneous segment 2 of the RhD protein also in cis with a hybrid exon 5 (RHD*D-CE(5)-D) and in trans with the RHD*950delA in exon 7. Conclusion: We have identified two novel alleles carrying the mutations associated with DV type 2 and one additional point mutation each in trans with RHD*950delA. The donors herein characterized are from the same region but non-related. The intense process of admixture between descendants of Europeans, African and native-Americans genes in Brazilian blood donors can contribute to this RHD gene variability.CP226 N Typing Discrepancies Caused By Glycophorin Hybrid Genes Associated with St a Jessica Keller*, Trina Horn and Margaret A Keller.

Of these, 800(0.86%) specimens were HBsAg positive by ELISA. Amongst HBsAg non-reactive samples, 64,065 samples were also tested by MPX-PCR. Of these, 69 samples (0.107%) were found to be positive for HBV DNA giving the nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) yield of 1:928. Mean age distribution of these 69 NAT positive donors was found to be 35.64 years (18-63 years) & of these 66 (95.6%) were males and 3(4.4%) were females.Of theHBV DNA positive samples 15 (21.74%) were positive for HBsAg on follow-up serology testing& were classified as WPD. Of these, 10 (66.6%), 2(13.3%) & 3(20%) donors tested positive on 3, 1 & 6 months respectively. Remaining 54 (78.3%) donors were found to be negative for HBsAg on follow-up serology testing and were classified as true OBI. The prevalence of window period donation & true OBI was found to be 1:4271 & 1:1186 respectively. Conclusion: HBsAg screening of blood donors is inadequate because of its limitations in recognizing OBI & WPD. These are thus considered an obscured menace questioning the safety of blood transfusion. Nucleic acid amplification testing plays a great role in circumventing the potential risk of HBV transmission by unravelingthe missed cases of HBV infection by HBsAg screening. Moreover, the life-saving mantle of blood transfusion makes NAT a crucial element of modern transfusion service.CP342Occult Hepatitis B Virus Infection Among Apheresis Donors in a Region of Central China Lei Zhao* 1,2 , Tingting Xu 1 , Li Yao 1 and Gang Li 1 .",

This was an inventory reduction of 6,967 units over seven years. Donor letters were implemented in 2011 and a total of 309 letters were sent to rare donors. This includes rare donors who donated in 2010 and 2011. The number of rare donor donations increased by over 200 donations from 2010 to 2011. In 2013, inventory reduction measures were implemented yet the number of rare donor donations decreased by only 7 donations from 2012 to 2013. Since 2011, the percentage of rare donor donations compared to the total number of donations per year has maintained an average of 3.47%. Conclusion: Despite inventory reduction efforts, we have maintained the number of rare donor donations. One possible explanation is the letter educating the donors of their rare status. The decrease in number of letters sent while maintaining a consistent percentage of rare donations indicates many of the rare donors are repeat donors.

Different strategies such as washing and reduction of plasma volume by centrifugation have been used to reduce the risk of hemolysis. Although it is still controversial whether there is a \"safe\" titer that would not result in hemolysis, many institutions provide \"low titer\" units when transfusing minor ABO incompatible platelets. Another strategy that has been proposed but not evaluated includes the use of platelet collected in platelet additive solution (PAS). The aims of this study are 1) to characterize isoagglutinin titers in platelets stored in PAS and evaluate how they compare to titers from unmodified donor plasma, 2) to evaluate cost of the use of PAS compared to plasma reduction. Study Design/Method: Paired plasma donor (unmodified) and platelet (collected in PAS-F) samples were obtained from the local blood center. Using the tube method, serial two fold dilutions of plasma was prepared for both IgM and IgG antibodies. The titer was interpreted as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that yields a 11 macroscopic reaction. Results/Finding: A total of 101 pairs of donor/platelet samples were tested including 40 group O, 52 group A and 9 group B. The titer median and range for donor samples and PAS platelets are presented onTable 1a. Overall, PAS platelets units' isoagglutinin titers were 1.3 dilutions lower than unmodified plasma donor samples. Group O anti-A titers distribution for PAS and donor samples are presented onTable 1b. No group O PAS platelets had a titer > 64. Cost analysis demonstrated that 1unit of plasma reduced platelets Some patients do not demonstrate serologic interference; anecdotally these patients may have poorer clinical response.

She was Group A, weak D1 with a history of transfusion several years prior. The Immunohematology Reference Lab identified anti -e, -K, -Fy a , -Jk b and unexplained reactivity with all reagent red cells tested except her own. Molecular testing was recommended to aid in antibody identification and selection of compatible units. Study Design/Method: Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA peripheral blood. RBC genotyping included PreciseType HEA Molecular (HEA), RHD and RHCE BeadChips (Immucor), PCR RFLP analysis for RHD c.1136C>T and RHCE c.254C>G. Sanger Sequencing of RHCE-cDNA PCR products RHD genotype results supported the patient being hemizygous or homozygous for RHD*DAR1 family allele. This D variant often presents as a serologic weak D. RHCE genotyping found the patient to carry a RHCE*ceEK allele and a novel allele with c.712G, 787G, 800A but lacking 48C. This allele is provisionally called RHCE*ceEK.01. The predicted Rh phenotype is partial D1 C-E-partial c partial e and hr S -. Punnett square analysis for RH genotype matching assigned donors homozygous for RHCE*ceEK as Tier 2 whereas donors homozygous for other hr S -alleles such as RHCE*ceMO and RHCE*ceAR were assigned Tier 3.Conclusion: Individuals carrying RHCE variant alleles that predict an Ehr S -phenotype are at risk of anti-hr S and anti-Hr. It is known that patients with anti-hr S are not compatible with all RBCs carrying any of the several alleles predicted to be hr S -. The testing in this patient suggested that a patient with RHCE*ceEK alleles and allo-anti-hr S and -Hr could be compatible with donor units carrying RHCE*ceAR and RHCE*ceMO. Since RBCs negative for E and hr S are rare in the US population, studies showing that different hr S -alleles may be cross compatible may aid in the effort to find compatible blood products for such patients.C33-A03DCryopreserved Buffy Coat-Derived Monocytes for the Assessment of Alloantibody Clinical Significance Betty Kipkeu 1 , Donald R.

Plasma for fractionation (PF) was collected with a PCSV R 2 Plasma Collection System by Haemonetics. . Citrate exposure and volumes collected were averages. Rates of CRs and VVRs with and without loss of consciousness (LOC) are presented per 100 apheresis donations for the period January 1 2016 to December 31 2016. Donation of multiple products during one procedure is counted as one. Chi-square and chi-square for trend tests were used to compare rates. Results/Finding: A total of 80,409 apheresis procedures were performed on 14,742 donors leading to 5447 CR (rate: 6.8%), 2006 VVR without LOC (rate: 2.5%) and 77 VVR with LOC (rate: 0.1%). Male represented 74% of apheresis donors. Rates of CR were higher in males (7.0% vs 6.0%, p<0.001). Rates of VVR were much higher in females (without LOC: 6.2% vs 1.6%, p<0.001; with LOC: 0.22% vs 0.06%, p<0.001). Rates of CR were similar in all age groups. For VVR there was a steady linear decrease in rates from 6.1% in the 18-22 yo to 1.0% in the 711 yo. Rates per type of procedure are shown in table. There was a statistically significant increase in the rates of CR according to citrate exposure (p<0.001). Trend was less clear for VVR rates according to volume collected from donor. Conclusion: When taking into account all severities of DCs related to apheresis donations, rates of CR and VVR are quite significant. Measures must be taken to decrease DCs during apheresis like Ca supplements in prophylaxis and volume replacement by saline.C42-A03EVaccination Campaign As a Way to Recruit Donors during a Yellow Fever Virus Outbreak in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Luiz Amorim*, Margarida P\u00eacego, Patricia Moura, Beatriz Bianchi, Simone Maia and Maria Esther Lopes.

Our previous work has correlated a critical link between platelet and mitochondrial function and convincingly shown that by maintaining platelet mitochondria, shelf life and function of platelets can be extended. The objective of this study was to evaluate the function of a lyophilized platelet-derived hemostatic product (LPHP) as a potential alternative to fresh platelets and determine if mitochondrial function plays a role in the hemostatic properties of such products. Study Design/Methods: Platelets were collected by centrifugation of whole blood from healthy donors under an institute-approved standard operating procedure. LPHPs were reconstituted with water; measures included rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), optical aggregometry and flow cytometry. Thrombin generation potentials were evaluated by calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT). Mitochondrial function was assessed with high resolution respirometry (Oroboros). Finally, adhesion to a collagencoated surface while under flow was assessed (Bioflux).",

Cold temperature storage could reduce bacterial proliferation but cold exposure produces activation-like changes in platelets and leads to their rapid clearance from circulation. Cold-induced changes are reversible by warming and In vitro results indicated that cold and TC platelets had reduced metabolism during storage with higher Oxygen and glucose levels and reduced lactate compared to RT platelets. Cold platelets had lowest morphology score and CD42b expression and the highest Annexin V binding. P selectin expression was equivalent for TC and Cold but both were higher than RT platelets. In functional responses Cold platelets had the lowest hypotonic stress, shape change and aggregation responses while TC platelets had intermediate results. In vivo results were different between the two apheresis instruments so the data are presented separately(Table 1). Cold stored platelets had the lowest recovery, survival and area under the curve. Temperature cycled platelets had improved recovery, survival and 2.2 fold greater area under the curve compared cold stored platelets. However, compared to RT platelets TC platelets had lower recovery, survival and 4 fold lower area under the curve.Conclusion: Temperature cycled cold storage for 7 days produces platelets with better in vivo circulation kinetics than continuous cold storage.",

The limiting antigen avidity (LAg avidity) assay can be used to estimate the proportion of HIV-seropositive donors who seroconverted in the four months before donation. The objectives of this study are to determine the proportion of HIV-positive donors with recent infections and to assess if demographic or other factors are associated with recently-acquired infection in US donors. Study Design/Method: Four large blood collection organizations provided plasma samples from index donations that were confirmed NAT and HIV-1 antibody positive by routine testing from 2010 through 2016. These samples were tested using the Sedia Biosciences LAg avidity assay which has a mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) of 130 days [$4 months] (95%CI 118 -142 days) based on the product insert recommended normalized optical density (ODn) cut-off of 1.5. Samples with ODn values of 2.0 were retested and the mean ODn values used. Associations between demographic and other donation characteristics, such as the interdonation interval (IDI) in repeat donors, were assessed comparing recent and long-standing HIV infection groups.Results/Finding: A total of 626 confirmed HIV RNA/antibody-positive donor plasma samples were tested with 31.5% classified as having recentlyacquired infection. The proportion of donors with recent infection did not vary across the seven years. Younger donors, and independently, repeat donors were more likely to have recent infection (p<0.001 in both cases). As would be expected, in repeat donors the shorter the IDI before the HIVpositive donation, the more likely the HIV infection was recently acquired (p for trend<0.001). Recent infection in younger, repeat donors was notable (table). Sex and race/ethnicity groups were not significantly associated with recent infection.",

U.S. Army, 2 DDEAMC / KMBC, 3 US Army Background/Case Studies: After implementation of the adjusted male hemoglobin standard, an Army Blood Donor Center noted a significant increase in hemoglobin deferrals, from 6.7% in 2015 to 12.3% in 2016. After scrutiny of the increase in hemoglobin deferrals, it was determined that the majority of these deferrals were observed at two different Service Component Basic Training Sites in the Southeast. The population at Basic Training Site A is the largest and most active initial entry station in the Army, training 50% of all new recruits and 60% of all enlisted women of the Army. The demographics at Basic Training Site B are much different where roughly 7% of all Marine recruits are women. Study Design/Method: Basic Training Site A is an Army Basic Training site, while Basic Training Site B is a Marine Basic Training Site. The recruits at basic Training Site A present for the ASBP blood drive on day 60 in a 70-day 103A TRANSFUSION 2017 Vol. 57 Supplement S3 training cycle, while the blood drives as Basic Training Site B are scheduled day 60 in a 90 day training cycle, therefore each of these groups of trainees present at roughly the same times in their separate training schedules, with the same amount of time from initial entry to when ASBP blood drives are scheduled. Monthly hemoglobin deferral percentages for Basic Training Site A and B were obtained and calculated in 2015 and 2016 and compared using a T test. Results/Finding: When hemoglobin deferrals obtained in 2015 are compared to those obtained in 2016, both Basic Training Sites A and B demonstrated a significant increase in hemoglobin deferrals. Basic Training Site A increased from 9% to 16% (p 5<0.01), and Basic Training Site B increased from 10% to 24% (p 5 <0.01). The hemoglobin deferral demographics at Basic Training Site A were further stratified to demonstrate that 141 of 177 (80%) in 2015; and 258 of 359 (72%) in 2016 were from female basic trainees. The hemoglobin deferral demographic stratification of Basic Training Site B revealed that 23 of 136 (14%) in 2015 and 5 of 275 (1.8%) in 2016",

Mayo Clinic Background/Case Studies: Blood donor centers are plagued with hemoglobin (hgb) deferrals. An accurate hgb value is important to mitigate unnecessary deferrals. On June 1, 2016 an institutional value analysis team made the decision to implement a different finger stick lancet to reduce cost.The newly acquired lancet B retained the same depth of 1.8 mm as the original lancet A. The focal difference of lancet B was a smaller 23 gauge needle versus the previous 21 gauge needle of lancet A. The objective of this study is to determine if the lancet conversion has impacted the number of finger sticks required to obtain a free flowing sample of blood and, additionally if a difference in the donor hgb value and subsequent deferral can be observed. Study Design/Methods: Lancet B usage and hgb value information was accumulated for a 6 month period starting on June 1, 2016. The same information was assembled for lancet A for a 6 month period starting on June 1, 2015. A donor may be included multiple times in each year and could be in both years of data. Hemoglobin assessment, donor gender, proportion of first time donors and the number of visits per donor across the two years were evaluated.

However, little information is available regarding the demographic characteristics of the donors. This is an analysis of demographic and physiologic characteristics of a group of Normal Source plasma donors in the United States.

Results were compared to those of reference USA populations (Health United States 2013; CDC Anthropometric Reference Data 2007-2010). Results/Finding: Donors were 61.1% male, 46.0% white, 18.0% Hispanic, 13.2% African-American, and averaged 30.0 years old. Donors were similar (p>0.05) to the reference population in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity by age group.

Data on drug use among blood donors are necessary to guide the development of relevant donor selection criteria. This study was performed to estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use and associated factors among blood donors and to estimate non-compliance to our donor selection criteria regarding drugs and its associated factors. Study Design/Methods: An anonymous online survey was carried out among individuals who gave blood between 09/2015 and 06/2016 for which an email address was available. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing: a) socio-demographic characteristics; b) use of illicit drugs in the previous 12 months; c) cocaine snorting in the previous 6 months; d) drug injection in the previous 12 months and lifetime. Prevalence rates were calculated according to age, sex, region of residence and first-time donor status. Overall prevalence rates were weighted according to the source population distribution of gender, age and first-time donor status during the study period. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to study correlates of drug use and of non-compliance. Results/Finding: Of the 35,850 donors contacted, 11,760 completed the survey (participation rate: 32.8%). Of them, 173 were excluded because of incomplete answers. Of the 11,587 participants, 47.4% were female vs 48.2 % in source population (p 5 0.12), 4.3% first-time donors vs 19.3% (p < 0.0001), and 11.8% < 25 years old vs 22.2% (p < 0.0001). Overall rate of any drug use was 9.4% (weighted rate 13.5%). Cannabis was most frequently used (12.7%) followed by ecstasy (1.2%), hallucinogens (1.1%), cocaine (1.1%), and amphetamines (1.0%), other drugs (< 1%). Lifetime and past year drug injection (DI) were reported respectively by 0.1% and 0.01% of donors. Noncompliance to lifetime DI or past 6-month cocaine snorting criteria was 0.38%. Multivariate analyses are presented in table. Factors significantly associated with drug use were: male gender, young age and living in a large urban area whereas male gender and young age were associated to non-compliance. Conclusion: The prevalence of drug use among blood donors was not negligible. The impact of non-injection drug use on blood safety is unknown. Despite being deferral criteria, lifetime drug injection or past 6-month cocaine snorting were reported by 0.38% of donors. However, it is likely that our donor selection process is effective in excluding high risk drug users given our very low rates of transmissible disease markers.CP106Fear is Related to Risk of Fainting Among Blood Donors: A Retrospective Analysis Confirms the Association Even If We Don't Ask Them to Talk about It. Christopher R France* and Janis L France. Ohio University Background/Case Studies: Asking prospective blood donors about donation-related fears is the first step in helping them to cope. Unfortunately, blood collections staff are typically reticent to make such inquiries due a belief that this causes donor distress and increases the risk of fainting. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear is related to risk of fainting independent of pre-donation assessment. Study Design/Method: An anonymous online survey was conducted among individuals who reported donating blood within the previous 30 days (N51244; 47.4% Female; Mean Prior Donations 5 5.6, SD 5 3.3; 18.0% First-time donors). Respondents answered a series of questions about their most recent donation, including pre-donation fear of having blood drawn and donation-related faint and pre-faint reactions. Using logistic and linear regression analyses, fear was related to fainting and pre-faint reactions while controlling for donation experience. Results/Finding: Relative to those who rated their pre-donation fear as 0 (\"not at all afraid\"), fearful donors had higher odds of reporting that they Although caution is needed in interpreting retrospective data due to possible reporting bias, the present findings suggest that routine predonation fear assessment may help to identify donors who are at increased risk for syncopal reactions.CP107 Impact of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) May 2016 21 CFR Part 600 \"Final Rule\" on Donations Louis M.

San Diego Blood Bank Background/Case Studies: Previously, donor eligibility was assessed in our facility by testing capillary blood from donor candidates in the HemoCue Hb 301B System (HC). Donor candidates with hemoglobin values greater than or equal to 12.5 g/dL were eligible for donation. We validated a new hematocrit measuring device, the UltraCrit (UC, from Separation Technology, Inc., STI) and implemented it as our test method of record in July, 2016. Nine months of deferral rate data with the UC, based on a cut-off of hematocrit values greater than or equal to 38%, were used for comparison with our prior method of record. Study Design/Method: The UC ultrasound based system was subjected to an Instrument Validation protocol approved by our Quality Assurance Department. The nine months of deferral data for both methods are based on single determinations on capillary blood samples and application of the above stated cut-off values. Results/Finding: The UC hematocrit measuring system met the manufacturer's specifications during the validation process (installation, operational and performance qualifications). Precision and accuracy testing yielded results that supported the decision to implement the UC as the method of record in our blood bank in July, 2016. The HC 301B was the method of record for all testing in October, 2015 through June, 2016. During this time, 7,218 donor candidates out of 83,647 tested had results below 12.5 g/dL, for a deferral rate of 8.6%. 46,246 out of 83,647 total (55%) were tested in mobile units; the deferral rate for this population was 8.6%. The data from the UC testing for nine months post implementation on July 1, 2016 yielded a deferral rate of 6.5%, with 5,370 deferred out of 82,144 tested. The deferral rate at mobile units using the UC was 6.3%, for 44,906 out of the total 82,144 tested (55%). On an annual basis, this decrease in deferral rates translates to a collection of an additional 2,300 units per year. Conclusion: The comparison of deferral rates during a nine month period since the UltraCrit was implemented to the nine months prior to the implementation demonstrates a significant decrease in deferral rates based on hemoglobin and hematocrit test results. The decrease in deferral rates was observed in both mobile unit collections and fixed facility collections. The decrease in deferral rates over nine months has contributed to a significant increase in units collected.CP112Results of a Pilot Program of Iron Supplementation for Double-Red Blood Cell Donors Gilles Delage*, Yves Gr egoire and Isabelle Rabusseau. H ema-Qu ebecBackground/Case Studies: Double red blood cell donations (DRBCD) can lead to depleted iron stores, especially in frequent donors. Iron supplementation has been shown to prevent iron depletion secondary to blood donation. A pilot study of iron supplementation was carried out in one of the donor sites in order to evaluate feasibility of such a program. The following parameters were measured: acceptance of, tolerance of and compliance with supplementation, effect on ferritin levels and rates of DRBCD. Study Design/Method: The study design was an open trial. Only donors who had made at least one successful DRBCD were solicited. Once informed consent had been obtained, donors were given 100 tablets of ferrous sulfate 300 mg (60mg elemental iron) at each visit for a DRBCD, and instructed to take one tablet per day. Information on side effects and on precautions to take with the supplements were given. At each visit, ferritin levels were measured since routine ferritin monitoring is in place at that donor site, and questionnaires on compliance with supplementation and side effects were filled out. Results/Finding: 294 donors who chose to participate and for whom we had at least 2 ferritin measurements constituted the participants; 177 donors who refused participation served as the control group. All but one donor were male. Age distribution and the number of previous RBC donations of participants and controls were similar. However, participants gave more RBC donations per year then controls during the study: 49.8% of donors vs only 39.5% of controls gave !5 RBC/year (p50.032). Compliance (defined by taking !75% of tablets) varied from 59 % in the first course to close to 100% in those who took 3 or 4 courses. Questionnaires were filled out for 494 courses of supplementation: in 356 courses no adverse effects were noted. The most frequent side effects reported were constipation (73), dys-",

Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association Background/Case Studies: Knowledge of Source Plasma (SP) donor demographics sheds light on the plasma collection industry. Many misperceptions abound pertaining to plasma donation. Knowing basics such as donor age, weight, and donation frequency helps understand who donates. Thus, plasma industry donation data were analyzed to provide a donor profile. Information about SP donation volume and frequency have previously not been available. Study Design/Methods: An industry-wide collection of donor demographic data for 2012 on approximately 1.5 million donors and 25.2 million donations from 7 participating companies were analyzed. The data included age, weight, and gender of donors, and how often they donated. Donation volume limits, set by FDA memorandum, are weight dependent. The collection volume (plasma and anticoagulant) for a donor 110-149 lbs is 690 ml [GI]; 150-174 lbs, 825 ml [GII]; and 1751 lbs, 880 ml [GIII]. Donation distributional statistics are presented. Results/Findings: Overall, 61% of SP donors are male. Thirty percent of total donations are given by donors age 25-34, and about 55% by donors <35 years old. The overall donation rate is highest for 55-64 year olds, 31/ year. For those weighing 110-129 lbs, 71% are female; in those 130-149 lbs, female and male percentages are approximately equal (49%); and !150 lbs, a greater percentage is male (e.g. 71% male at 3501 lbs).Overall, the highest percentage of female and all donors weigh 150-174 lbs. For males, the highest percentage of donors weigh 175-199 lbs. Donation frequency increases with increasing weight: 10 donations for the lightest donors vs. 17.3 for those 300-349 lbs. The highest donation rate for both females and males is for those weighing 300-349-lbs: though they comprise a small percent of donors.Sixty-two percent of donors fell in GIII; 22% in GII; and 16% in GI. Sixtysix percent of donations were made by GIII donors; 21% by GII; and 13% by GI. Of the total volume collected, 69% was donated by GIII donors; 20% by GII; and 10% by GI. Of male donors, 42.3% are 2001 lbs (35.9% of US male population); 13.5% are 2501 lbs (9.2%); and 3.3% are 3001 lbs (2.5%). Of female donors, 35.0% are 2001 lbs (20.6% of US female population); 11.6% are 2501 lbs (6.1%); and 2.7% are 3001 lbs (1.7%).The average number of donations per donor was 17.5 in 2012. For the 12 months from their last donation the number increased to 21.4; 49% of donors made 10 donations; 14% made >50; and 0.3% made >100. Conclusion: In contrast to blood donors, the majority of plasma donors are male. Young donors, <35 years old, who provide fewer donations than older donors, make the majority of donations. Heavier donors donate the most frequently. Frequent donors are essential to achieving critical plasma supplies for manufacturing essential lifesaving protein therapies.CP114Status of a Successful Hospital-Based Blood Center Hemochromatosis Donor Program: 16 Years Later Cathy Conry-Cantilena*, Kamille West, Yu Ying Yau and Susan Leitman.

University of Michigan Background/Case Studies: RBC are considered devoid of HLA antigens, however 50% of donors have detectable class 1 antigens on RBC by flow cytometry, especially in certain HLA types (B7[Bg a ], B17[Bg b ], A28/A2[Bg c ]; A9,A10,B12,B15). Rarely, HLA antibodies (HLAb) have been associated with shortened RBC survival & hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR). We report a case of HTR attributed to HLAb in a transfusion (txn)-dependent patient. Study Design/Method: ABO type, antibody screen (ABS) & identification were by gel method. DAT was by tube method. RBC acid eluate was prepared per manufacturer's instructions & tested against RBC by tube (30'37C, PEG). HLAb testing was performed by a fluorescent bead-based assay. RBC samples from group O, HLA-typed, renal transplant patients were obtained from hematology. Results/Finding: The patient was an 81-year-old, O1 woman with chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia, RBC alloimmunization (anti-K1, E, C w ), cryptogenic cirrhosis, diabetes, chronic kidney disease & occult GI bleeding. She was treated with IV iron, folate, darbopoietin, & episodic RBC txns until 6/ 2016, followed by increasing RBC requirements which reached 1-2 RBC twice weekly by 12/2016. During a routine RBC txn in 1/2017, she developed rigors, headache, fatigue, nausea & hypertension (BP143/63!198/74). Laboratory workup showed no clerical errors. She typed as O1 & ABS showedanti-E. Visual hemolysis check was weakly positive on 2 specimens. Labs drawn 12 hours post-txn showed no increase in hemoglobin (7.2!7.3gm/ dL), #haptoglobin <10mg/dL, & \"LDH (270 IU/L). The DAT was weakly positive (polyspecific 11, IgG 11, C3 0) with pre-& post-txn specimens. A RBC eluate was negative against donor RBC & 3/3 panel cells. Donor RBC were K1-,E-,Cw-& crossmatch-compatible (XM) with pre-& post-txn specimens by tube, but was XM-incompatible by gel. Additional plasma testing showed weak reactivity against 3/3 E-,K-,Cw-, HLA1 panel cells (11, tube, PEG), which was sensitive to chloroquine (0-6). HLAb testing showed that the patient was highly alloimmunized with high-titer HLAb to class 1 (PRA591%) & class II (PRA562%) antigens. In addition, weak class I HLAb (PRA524%, MFI<3000), but no class II HLAb (PRA50), were identified in the RBC eluate, including HLAb against B7,A2,B8,B57. Patient plasma was weakly reactive with 11/30 donor RBC & 2/5 RBC from group O, E-,K1-,Cw-, HLA-typed, renal patients positive for at least 1 antigen crossreactive with A2[B57] or B17[B15]. Subsequent RBC for transfusion were XM-compatible by gel: An attempt to obtain HLA-matched RBC was unsuccessful. The patient was placed on amicar & weekly IVIG with slight improvement in RBC survival & haptoglobin (82mg/dL). Due to ongoing medical issues, the patient was transitioned to hospice care. Conclusion: We present another case of HTR & poor RBC survival likely due to high titer HLAb.

No cases of RhD alloimmunization attributed to transfusion of DEL RBCs have been reported in the US. Conclusion: The most likely explanation for the absence of reported cases of DEL-related RhD alloimmunization is the lack of active post-transfusion hemovigilance.

            "text": "TRALI is the leading cause of transfusion related deaths. Under-reporting of TRALI to the transfusion medicine service creates the risk of causing TRALI in additional patients who receive products from the same donor. In such cases, TRALI can be prevented if the implicated donor is identified and removed from the donor pool via indefinite deferral. It is the role of the transfusion medicine service to investigate every possible TRALI case to determine if the diagnosis is warranted and then further investigate donor blood for causative antibodies and if found, test their reactivity to the recipient's WBCs. It may be an arduous process to identify and indefinitely defer a donor who is implicated in a case of TRALI but the critical first step is for the clinical team to report the reaction. From this study we conclude that TRALI is under-reported to the transfusion medicine service at our institution. Our results show that 80% of possible TRALI cases were not reported to our transfusion medicine service from 2011-2016. We suspect that other institutions would show similar results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of TRALI, TACO and TAD between males and females. Our data may indicate that the incidence of TACO is higher in the elderly. Only one case of TACO and two cases of TAD were reported in children. Eleven TRALI cases were reported after red blood cell transfusion and eleven cases after platelet transfusion. TRALI was never reported after Octaplas transfusion, but both TACO and TAD were reported.Conclusion: Pulmonary transfusion complications are the leading cause of transfusion related mortality in Norway. To reduce the incidence of TRALI, screening for HLA-antibodies in both female and male donors, or inclusion of male only platelet donors could be attempted. TACO is potentially preventable, as the risk factors are well defined. Measures to reduce TACO should be taken in patients at risk.

The INR decreased in all patient groups (see table). The average decrease in INR for all plasma units was 1.60, 0.75 for patients receiving both FFP and LQP, 1.75 for patients receiving FFP only and 0.97 for patients receiving LQP only. Patients receiving plasma due to elevated INR values showed the greatest decrease in INR among all of the transfusion reasons evaluated. Patients receiving vitamin K showed greater changes in INR through all categories. Comparison of the total number of plasma units transfused showed patients receiving FFP only had greater changes in INR values than those receiving only LQP or both FFP and LQP when 1, 4, or >4 units were transfused at once. Patients receiving 2 units of plasma showed the greatest decrease in INR when LQP was transfused. Patients receiving 3 units of plasma showed the greatest change in INR when receiving mixture of FFP and LQP. Conclusion: When attempting to lower INR values, concurrent administration of vitamin K showed greater results than transfusion of plasma alone. Transfusion of FFP showed greater changes in INR than transfusion of LQP. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size of patients receiving LQP only in whom a change in INR value was available.

This was manageable since 100% of patients have a unique identifier and 75% had a historical ABO/Rh in the LIS. To minimize impact to group O inventory a second sample was obtained if more than 2 to 4 units were requested to confirm the ABO and allow the issue of group specific red cells. Neonatal patients continued to receive group O Rh negative red cells. Increased demand for group O was expected. Plasma components were excluded from the new transfusion protocol. Results/Findings: The population base of the RTS served is 1.3 million and the process has been in place for one year. The number of transfused red cells increased by 4.55 O positive and 0.88 O negative red cell units per day. The process was subsequently adapted to request the second ABO/Rh sample after the first unit was requested for transfusion. The solution provides more safety for patients than performing two blood groups on one sample, although the process does not solve the problem of a patient using another person's identification. Conclusion: In an RTS, utilizing the LIS to ensure only group O Rh compatible red cells can be issued until a second sample is tested for those patients who do not have a historical blood group on file; ensures the mistransfusion risk is reduced while incurring no delay in patient care.

Blood Bank of Hawaii Zika Virus Universal Donor Screening-First Years' Experience Background/Case Studies: Due to Hawaii's geographical location, presence of Aedes mosquitoes, and recent outbreaks of dengue virus (DENV), we began universal, individual donor testing for ZIKV on August 22, 2016. The findings represent the first 7 months of testing. Study Design/Methods: Procleix ZIKV TMA, under Hologic Inc. investigational new drug protocol, was performed by Creative Testing Solutions, Tempe, AZ. Initial reactive samples were repeated in duplicate. Supplemental testing including ZIKV qRT-PCR (plasma and red cells), ZIKV IgM antibody-capture ELISA, ZIKV IgG ELISA, and DENV IgG ELISA were performed by Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA. If a ZIKV antibody test was positive, a reporter viral particle neutralization test was performed. Trioplex RT-PCR on serum and urine and ZIKV IgM ELISA were performed by the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH). Donors with reactive donations were informed of their results and assessed for risk factors by the medical director. Donors with reactive ZIKV NAT results were invited to participate in a follow up study with additional samples drawn at approximately one week intervals. Lookback was performed per FDA recommendations. Results/ Findings: From 8/22/16-3/22/17, ten initially reactive donations were identified from 30,493 donations, for an initial reactive rate of 1 per 3049 donations tested.

The TSO's fundamental role is to improve patient safety in all aspects of transfusion practice. This position comes with several responsibilities that encompass the following areas: technical and clinical, utilization management, quality and risk, professional and educational, and research. A guide to assist a healthcare professional's transition into the role of a TSO is advantageous; however, there are limited resources to date. Study Design/Methods: In 2013, the clinical project coordinatortransfusion safety nurse from a provincial blood coordinating network visited various large healthcare institutions. Information was collected through observations and discussions with the TSOs about the daily activities and responsibilities. The TSOs from each institution identified that there was minimal guidance and limited resources to assist with their transition into the role.

Rapid and consistent response by Transfusion Service (TS) staff to MTP orders is essential. We used a combination of simulations involving ICU and TS staff and simple TS-only drills to improve MTP training effectiveness and improve TS response to MTP activation. Study Design/Method: All TS staff were trained on the MTP SOP and checklist prior to the study period. Mock code simulations that incorporated an MTP scenario were performed with ICU nurses and physicians. TS-only drills consisted of generating an MTP order on a test patient. All TS technologists participated in at least one drill. Technologists were aware of the general timeframe of a planned drill, but not the actual start time. Simulated units were prepared by photocopying actual in-date products. Order and issue times were recorded as part of the real and drill procedures. Uncrossmatched RBC and other products (6RBC/4FFP/1 PLT) were issued manually. For ICU simulations, photocopies of units were delivered by pneumatic tube. Time in minutes was measured between initiation of the MTP order and issue of first RBC unit, first unit plasma, and platelet. Goal times were <10 min for RBC and PLT and <30 min for FFP. Deviations from SOP were identified and staff coached as part of debriefing. Results/Finding: TS with and without ICU staff conducted 5 drills/simulations and measured performance in 14 actual MTPs between Jan and Dec 2016 (total 19 MTP). In Q1 (baseline), the TS met goal time to issue product in 80% of MTP activations or drills for RBC, 29% for FFP and 38% for PLT. In Q4 (follow up), the TS met goal issue time in 100% of activations for RBC and FFP and 75% of the time for PLT. For RBC, median time between order receipt and issue improved from 6 (range 1-46) min at baseline to 2 (range 1-5) min at follow up. Median issue time for PLT improved from 14 (4-51) min at baseline to 9 (2-18) min at follow up. Median time to issue for FFP did not change from baseline to follow up, but the range in issue times was smaller: median issue time 29 min at baseline (range 13-46 min) and 29 min at follow up (range 20-30 min).Conclusion: An audit of TS MTP performance (time of activation to issue of first product) showed improvement was needed. ICU simulations and TSonly MTP drills improved TS response time for RBC and PLT issue and improved consistency of performance in MTP situations. Improvement in FFP issue time may not be possible unless a policy to maintain thawed plasma for MTP is implemented. Simple MTP drills can be incorporated into TS training and competency assessment.AP29 When Medicine Meets Religion: Preparing for the Bloodless Needs of the Jehovah's Witness Patient Kael Vaun Mikesell*, Darcy Dore and Leon Binette.

Casina*. Ortho Clinical DiagnosticsBackground/Case Studies: The ongoing challenges of recruiting qualified medical technologists into transfusion medicine often stretches the capacity of the transfusion service (TSV) to meet the patient care needs expected by clinicians. Automation in the TSV has had positive impact to counterbalance these challenges. Previous generations of automated instruments have had some impact on alleviating a certain amount of the workload labor intensity. This study evaluates the potential impact of a newer instrument ORTHO VISIONV R (VS) compared with a current state instrument Immucor ECHO TM (EC). The only automated testing done currently is the Type & Screen (TS), averaging about 60-70 TS's per day. STAT TS may or may not be automated depending on instrument status. All other testing profiles are completed manually in tube. Study Design/Method: The study was conducted in 2 phases using a current state (CS)/future state (FS) approach. Direct observation of processes employing timing studies was used to compare workflows utilizing the 2 instruments. Evaluation consistency was achieved through using at least 3 observations of each process and results averaged. The metrics evaluated were for cycle timing (CT) (mins:secs) of manual labor/ instrument time, turnaround time (TAT) and consumable waste. Results/Finding: The CS timing for tests follows: TS-EC (33:06), manual STAT TS (22:08), AbID (34:55), patient ABO/RH (3:46), neonatal Type (2:58), Cord Blood (CB)(14:00) and Titration (TT) 85:00. The majority of measured time for manual tests was in labor and vigilance (time that requires the technologist presence and attention). The waste generated by the EC equated to 40% of all solid phase strips tested. To avoid waste, holding of samples to process was observed in some cases resulting longer TAT. Often STAT TS were directed to the manual workbench to avoid these issues. For the FS (VS) and automated processing of TS, ABO/RH, AbID, CB, and TT, the laboratory achieved improvement in labor time and improved CT. The CT was for TS (31:06), AbID (33:00), patient ABO/RH (13:00), CB (17:00), and TT (35:00). The total TAT for TS was often shorter for VS as samples were held for EC testing to avoid waste. The average STAT TS on VS resulted in an improvement of 7% in TAT and 9% in STAT TAT compliance respectively. Automating AbID testing provided an 82% labor improvement with 29 minutes of walkaway time over the manual AbID allowing for focus on other critical TSV activities. Automating CB and TT delivers an additional 96% and 80% labor reduction. Overall, 75 labor hours were recovered moving to the FS. Conclusion: Based on gains in labor reduction delivered by VISION, the TSV has modified the CS workflow process utilized with the ECHO system, to deliver improvements in TAT and adequate staff in times of resource challenges AP33 Experiencing the Birth of Twins: Simultaneous Move of a Hospital and Implementation of a New EHR System Michele DeRee* 1 , Lisa Martini 1 and Chris Gresens 2 . 1 Sutter Health,BloodSourceBackground/Case Studies: California's seismic laws recently necessitated building a new hospital to replace one of two existing facilities which no longer met current earthquake standards. In August 2015 the outdated facility merged onto the site of the other hospital, forming a single, larger campus. A new electronic health record (eHR) system was activated on the same day because the new campus was not designed to maintain and store paper records. Preparation for bridging cultures between the two separate facilities, training staff for a new work environment and using the new eHR began in 2014. This study examines the impact on the transfusion services as staff prepared for the various workflow changes associated with implementation of the new eHR and integration of patient workflows at a new location. Study Design/Method: In order to ensure an effective transition and implementation the transfusion services developed a training module tailored to the use of the new blood ordering module (BOM) within the eHR. The BOM requires a 2-part order: one for testing/product, the other for the transfusion order. This represents a new workflow for affected nurses and physicians.",

Since year 2004 the government of USA grant called CDC Blood safety project were the sole development partner organization supporting BTS in Ethiopia. Assessing the impact of partners support and government commitment level towards establishing sustainable and safe blood service program will have major inputs for continuity of health care delivery in Ethiopia Study Design/Methods: A retrospective analysis on US government CDC Blood safety grant awards in the project periods of 2004-09 and 2010-2016 and review on Ethiopian government GMS, national blood donor database records covering 2005-2015 and review on new blood service strategy implementation status was also made, so as to understand the impact of the grant and government commitment level. Results/Findings: Grant project periods covering 2004-09 and 2010-2016 analysis reveals that the first project period was found challenged by government underutilization, poor GMS and delayed grant budget release. The review on the second project period highlights that grant level increased from 500 USD up to 3500 USD per annum following good performance and proper fund utilization rate of the government. The review on new strategy implementation status indicates that the increased government commitment level initiated by developing new strategy in 2005 and full reversion of the blood service administration from Red Cross society to the government health care system made in 2013.

Heartland Blood Centers Background/Case Studies: Improved supply chain efficiencies and cost containment requirements initiated a review of established practices in the management of our blood supply. Fresenius Kabi's CompoTrace RFID Enabled Inventory Management System was implemented to assist in the management of blood component inventories at two hospital blood banks (BB). In addition to the management of component inventories, the hospitals used the Compo-Trace Ordering module to communicate their daily replenishment needs replacing the established practice of ordering via the phone. Starting in June and July 2016, we began two 90-day hospital studies to identify opportunities for improved efficiencies in the blood component supply chain. Study Design/ Methods: CompoTrace system components include RFID tags, computer kiosk, RFID reader and barcode scanner. Blood center (BC) distribution team applied RFID tags to blood components and recorded inventory into Compo-Trace using RFID reader and barcode scanner as hospital orders received. Hospital BB used CompoTrace RFID reader to receive blood components into their inventory. Hospital also used the RFID reader to record change in blood component inventory status: 1) issued units, 2) returned units into BB inventory 3) disposed units and 4) returned units to BC. Each hospital in study continued to use their BB system for critical decision making and tracking of blood components (Meditech and HCLL). BB staff used CompoTrace Ordering daily to communicate replenishment needs for standard, timed and STAT orders. Results/Findings: Having visibility to the frequency of blood component movement in hospital BB provided great insight to opportunity costs. Issued components compared to targeted inventory levels provided an opportunity to discuss inventory right-sizing. On-line ordering resulted in reduction of miscommunication of inventory needs of hospital BB and added process efficiencies. Size of equipment was not a barrier for use at study sites.Hospital A -Leukocyte-reduced RBC (LRBC) and Days Inventory On Hand (DIOH)Hospital B -LRBC and DIOH Conclusion: CompoTrace data assisted in identifying opportunities to rightsize inventories and optimize deliveries. Technicians found the system easy to use and applying RFID tags were not problematic.

Study Design/Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study which involved data review of red blood cell inventory from January 2009 -June 2016. Different categories of information were captured due to the changing policies in the Transfusion Service, as demonstrated inTable 1. The number of RBC crossmatched, dispensed, transfused, and wasted were entered into Microsoft Excel and the C:T ratio, C:I ratio, and cost were calculated. The red blood cell inventory levels was tracked starting May 3, 2014. Total red cell units available and crossmatched were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet daily. The daily averages were calculated for each time period as seen inTable 1. Results/Findings: The mean, standard deviation and a t-test with a 0.05 level of significance was performed to determine the statistical significance of the decrease in the C:T ratios and the C:I ratios over the 7 time periods. The C:T ratio mean was 1.91, standard deviation was 0.24, and t-test was -1.861 with a p-value of 0.03. The C:I ratio mean was 1.36, standard deviation was 0.27, t-test was -3.936 with a p-value of 0.00004. Conclusion: This study shows that implementation of the EXM has helped transfusion services become more efficient at lowering inventory levels with little impact from physician ordering practices. Lowering the levels of blood held for patients, the transfusion service decreased total stock levels for RBCs by 48%, reduce wastage, and thus lower the blood cost for the hospital by $27,813 at a red cell cost of $219 per unit.AP58Impending National Blood Product Shortage: A Transfusion Service Management Strategy Kerry OBrien* 1,2 , Monique Mohammed 2 and Lynne Uhl 1,2 . 1 Harvard Medical School, 2 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center",

Aronson 2 . 1 Advocate Christ Medical Center, 2 ACL Laboratories/ Advocate Hospitals Background/Case Studies: A large Midwest 750 bed hospital with very active Level I trauma center struggles to get blood from the Transfusion Service (TS) to the patient in an emergency situation. Multiple processes have been evaluated to lean the Emergency Release (ER) process as well as the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP). Automated blood dispensers were evaluated but due to the high cost and the incomplete interface with the Laboratory Information System (LIS) this solution was abandoned. A manual tracking process was created to ensure that blood was tracked to the correct patient. Study Design/Method: Process and requirement review was completed. A discussion with the Operating Room (OR) nursing staff helped determine needs, responsibilities and training. Two sets of 2 O negative Red Blood Cells (RBCs) were packaged together with Transfusion Administration Records (TARs) and a Remote Blood Record (RBR). This form indicates the date and time blood was received by OR staff and placed into the OR refrigerator. When the units are removed by designated staff, the RBR is completed to indicate patient demographics (patient label), date and time RBCs were utilized and individual removing units from the refrigerator. Return of the RBR to the TS indicates that replacement units are needed. Auditing of process includes completion of the RBR as well as completion of the TAR. Program was started on 10/20/2016 and data was evaluated through the end of March 2017. Results/Finding: There were 27 events where blood was utilized for 20 different patients. Seven events involved the same patient taking all 4 units rather than just 2 (1 set). A \"Doe\" patient was involved in 48.1% of the events. It was determined that 33.3% of the time the receiving information was not completed on the RBR but only 18.5% of the time the blood use information was incomplete. There were 3 events where the patient identification was not recorded on the RBR. Follow up was required for these events to find the identification either on the TAR copies or the medical record. Conclusion: The TS was uncomfortable with not having RBC units under complete TS control and very hesitant to allow other areas to have blood stored remotely. Due to the continued demand caused by the high number of trauma events, those concerns had to be set aside. The OR and TS staff continue to work together to identify the issues on a real-time basis so that process review and additional training can be completed as soon as possible. This program was expanded to the Emergency Department (ED) in February of 2017 due to the high number of traumas and the need for blood as part of patient resuscitation. The evaluation of this process shows that the blood is needed faster than the TS can send and although we struggle with documentation, this type of process is needed to accommodate the patients and surgeons in hopes of saving lives.",

BD Biosciences states in their package insert to prepare and run samples within 48 hours following leucoreduction. Following an event that required an excessive number of rWBC confirmation testing, we hypothesized that testing samples using the BD Leucocount TM Kit would produce valid results when the test time exceeded the required 48 hours following leukocyte reduction. Study Design/Method: A total of 8 red blood cell units were tested within 48 hours of leukocyte reduction using the BD Leucocount TM Kit within the Quality Control department at Bonfils Blood Center. Each unit exceeded the allowed rWBC count of 5 million, stayed within the upper linear limit of the testing assay (350 WBC/mcL), and resulted in an average WBC count of 51,950,730. These 8 units were properly stored for a total of 14 days following leukocyte reduction. On each consecutive day, a sample was removed from each unit and tested using the BD Leucocount TM Kit. The results for each consecutive day were compared to the original result that was tested within the required 48 hours following leukocyte reduction. Results/Finding: Of the 8 units tested, 4 (50%) demonstrated a decrease in rWBC of 20% or more when tested on day 14 compared to the result tested within 48 hours following leukocyte reduction. When reviewing all results obtained, it was noted that 8 (100%) of the units tested on day 10 demonstrated a decrease in rWBC of less than 20% (an average % difference of -12%; range from -6% to -19%).Conclusion: In this study, it was concluded that completing rWBC testing using the BD Leucocount TM Kit would yield reliable results when tested up to 10 days. During extenuating circumstances, extending the allowable timeframe to perform rWBC testing beyond 48hours may provide blood centers with a realistic window to assess the leukocyte reduction status of a large number of otherwise transfusible red blood cells.AP63Lipaemic Donations, to Transfuse or to Discard?

The objective of this study is to evaluate the current policy of dealing with lipaemic donations to improve the performance of KCBB. Study Design/Method: A retrospective study was done that include statistical analysis of number of tested and discarded units due to lipaemia in (KCBB) during the period from 2012 to 2016.

UCSF Health Background/Case Studies: Although data analytic tools greatly aid blood inventory management, laboratories may lack resources to access this technology. We used in-house skills to design and deploy a fully automated, dynamic, web-based, multi-site Transfusion Service (TS) electronic dashboard. Study Design/Method: Dashboard uses Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). Data is extracted in real-time from Sunquest (v7.3) Laboratory Information Systems Database (InterSystems Cache). The webpage that delivers data to client is distributed via Microsoft Group Policy shortcuts; webserver is hosted internally at our center and data secured both at rest and when in transit to the client workstations (Secure Socket Layer certificates). Results/Finding: Laboratory Informatics and TS collaborated to build the dashboard over 6 weeks. Prototypes were tested by our technologists. Their feedback helped make the tool user-friendly and integrate seamlessly with workflow. Dashboard data was validated before go-live in 2016. Dashboard is accessed via a desktop shortcut and also displayed on large monitors in the lab. Data refresh automatically every 2 min. Webpages are completely customizable and afford flexibility for updating pages on the fly, as well as capability to run them against a test environment. Five different tabs provide site-specific information. The 'Product Inventory' tab displays the following variables for RBC units: ABO/Rh, CMV status and units awaiting ABO retype. The Children's Hospital dashboard provides more details for RBCs: age < 5 days, divided units, and expiration time of washed units. Pages also display units required to replenish inventory, with a color code scheme to alert Staff. For platelets, ABO/Rh and CMV status are shown and for plasma and cryoprecipitate, ABO type is displayed. The 'Units Available' tab displays unit number, component type, ABO/Rh, expiration date and time. Different colors display units expiring in > 24 hours, < 24 hours and < 10 hours and a flashing display alerts Staff to units expiring in <1 hour. Expired units TABLE 1.

Final culture results are typically available within 5 days in our Laboratory Information System (LIS) but these results do not cross over to the associated patient's electronic medical record (EMR). Phone notification only occurs when cultures are positive. EMR documentation of the product culture result occurs when the Transfusion Medicine physician manually enters the result as an addendum to the transfusion reaction clinical note. In an effort to improve the turnaround time (TAT) for culture result documentation, we collaborated with LIS staff to develop an automated email alert to notify the Blood Bank Medical Director and Transfusion Safety Officer when final culture results are available.

Conclusion: Safe transfusion ordering requires a team approach to ensure the right information is available to the ordering provider at the right time. Safe ordering prevented recurrent allergic reactions in our patient population. The TSO plays a pivotal role in ensuring the full circle of communication occurs. Processes that integrated the pathology resident improved with PDSA cycles and impacted the quality and timeliness of hand off. Finally, the data provided from the residents enabled efficient participation in hemovigilance.",

SOPs were being followed but there was no standard work process that included the details so testing was not following the most efficient work flow. Counter measures implemented included implementing a standard work process, visual cues were added to the work process, and a samples awaiting testing report was created for the Batch Release Department. Specific locations were identified within the work cells in the lab to place samples based on their phase/stage of testing. After counter measures were implemented, the number of exceptions decreased from 17.4 per day or 10,370 DPMO to 6.3 per day or 3,539 DPMO. This is a statistically significant difference since the p-Value calculated was 0.002. Conclusion: A lean Six Sigma approach for process improvement was utilized to identify root causes and develop countermeasures in order to decrease the number of exceptions related to the testing of whole blood samples in the laboratory. This approach and counter measures statistically significantly decreased the number of exceptions seen in the whole blood testing process.",

Each type and screen specimen signed by 2 staff, one being a licensed practitioner attesting the identification of the patient was done accurately at bedside.To comply with the AABB Standards 29 th edition, #5.16.2.2 a decision was made to change our practices. We considered challenges encountered at other hospitals and collaborated with nursing and IT to create a streamlined and safe process. In April 2016, the second specimen procedure was implemented addressing the following: II. Extensive education was provided to all involved in the process prior to implementation including a learning module prepared by blood bank and nursing collaboratively. Results/Finding:1. There was a minor adjustment period with more phone calls made to blood bank to explain the process. 2. There was minimal impact on turn around times for release of components. 3. ABORh retype workload decreased from 1500 to 950 (35% to 20% of T&S volume) per month. 4. Unnecessary blood draws minimized, improving patient experience. 5.

Overall feedback from staff on the process has been positive. Our workload has decreased which results in cost savings and increased efficiency allowing us to devote more resources to the growing services at our institution. Background/Case Studies: The hazards of transfusion are well recognized and in certain cases restrictive transfusion strategies compared to liberal transfusion strategies may be associated with better clinical outcome. With this in mind, AABB and others published guidelines for transfusion, but even with guidelines in place, rate of inappropriate blood transfusions is reported to be as high as 15 to 48%. Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE), is a process of electronic medical order entry for medical practitioners with instructions and guidelines for treatment. The objective of this study was determination of transfusion practice quality by thorough chart and electronic medical record review, with measures in place to avoid inappropriate transfusion. Additionally, factors associated with inappropriate transfusion were examined. Study Design/Method: In our 926 bed hospital, a retrospective chart review was performed (07/01/15-12/31/15) on hospitalized internal medicine patients. CPOE with hospital guidelines for RBC transfusions were in place. Transfusion thresholds in different clinical settings were determined by a thorough literature review of studies analyzing restrictive transfusion strategy, and transfusion guidelines by various medical societies. Charts for Background/Case Studies: Our Midwestern University-Based Transfusion Service (TS) evaluated the appropriateness the automated platform VISION (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. Raritan, NJ) for prenatal titration studies. It has been established from previous publications that the micro-column assay, of which the VISION is based, may lead to higher titer results compared to standard tube titrations. This study sought to evaluate the transition from manual to automated titer studies from a sensitivity as well as cost perspective. Study Design/Method: Twenty-three prenatal retention plasma samples were tested as part of the evaluation of titration studies of the VISION. The samples were manually tested with a standard two-fold serial dilution. The titer was reported as the last tube to demonstrate a 11 reaction by macroscopic observation. The titer studies were then repeated using the VISION. The results of the manual and automated processes were compared and categorized as \"< 2 grade\" or \"> 2 grade\" difference between endpoints. This analysis is similar to the acceptable ranges used for evaluating College of American Pathologists (CAP) proficiency survey challenges. A cost analysis was completed based on the direct and indirect cost for each method, excluding the cost of an analyzer. Results/Finding: Table 1 demonstrates a summary of the samples tested by manual titer study and VISION titration method. The VISION titer results (mean, median, and mode) were higher than the manual tube titer results. Less than half of the samples (48%) were > 2 titer results higher, while the majority was 2 titer results different (52%). The cost analysis is summarized in Table 2 . The indirect cost (labor) was significantly lower with the use of the VISION. The reduction in pre-analytical technical time for manual preparation of the titration is eliminated with the VISION completing the titration as part of the profile of the titer study of the analyzer. Conclusion: With an estimated 41% decrease in the cost of a VISION titer compared to manual tube method, the change in practice would clearly be a cost and efficiency measure in the blood bank. However, the VISION demonstrated the expected increase in titer results compared to manual tube titer results. This would impact the critical values currently utilized. An impact assessment for clinical staff would be necessary to adequately implement the change in method. Consideration must be given to changes in the computer logic for critical values on titer studies and training of physician and nurse obstetric practitioners for changes in the critical values. In addition, as part of changing to the VISION an implementation period will be necessary to ensure that manual titers are compared to previous manual titers and not to VISION titer results which would be higher and may be interpreted as a significant change for clinical care of the patient.",

General Hospital Celje Background/Case Studies: We wanted to discover what is the best routine quality control practice for testing residual white blood cells in blood components. Our aim was to validate the Adam device for counting thne number of residual white blood cells (WBC) in leucocyte depleted and in non-leucocyte depleted blood components (BC) and to compare with standard counting method by microscopy in Fuchs Rosenthal chamber (FRC) used in GHC and with Flow cytometry (FC). Study Design/Method: After 23 samples of red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (leucocyte depleted in top and top (T/ T) bags and non-leucocyte depleted in top and bottom (T/B) bags) were stained with propidium iodide (PI) on r-Slides; Adam -rWBC device was messured fluorescent images of stained WBC nucleus. Data were analised by image analysis software and later compared with results of testing samples in FRC by microscopy and with FC.15 samples of BC were microscopic tested in FRC at Department of laboratory medicine in GHC; another 8 samples were measured with FC in UCC Maribor. Results/Finding: 15 samples (6 RBC, 3 PLT, 3 FFP-all leucocyte depleted and 3 non-leucocyte depleted FFP) were tested in triplicates on Adam and with FRC once.Coefficient of variation of (KV%) of samples measured on Adam for leucocyte depleted BC varied for: RBC from 44,10 -173,21; PLT from 86,60 -100,00; FFP from 86,60 -173,21; and for non-leucocyte depleted FFP from 0,69 -8,85 (Table 1) . 8 samples (2 RBC, 2 PLT, 2 FFP -all leucocyte depleted and 2 nonleucocyte depleted FFP) were tested in triplicates on Adam and with FC once.KV% of samples measured on Adam for leucocyte depleted BC varied for: RBC from 91, 56; PLT from 78, 21, FFP from 66, 21 ; and for non-leucocyte depleted FFP from 11,17 -15,91 (Table 2) .High percentage of KV was noticed in samples with low numbers of WBC (in leucocyte depleted BC; low percentage of KV in non-leucocyte depleted FFP, with higher amount of WBC was observed. Conclusion: All samples tested with Adam met expected criteria for WBC in BC in European Union (less than 1x10 9 /unit for leucocyte depleted or 1x10 6 / unit for non-leucocyte depleted) and were comparable with those tested with FC; the correlation with microscopy in FRC was worse.With use of disposable r-slides, the risk of exposure to the potential hazardous blood samples is grately reduced, the method is more precise and not time consuming.From January 2017 we changed our protocol for testing residual WBC in BC with Adam device and we advise it as the best practice for monthly routine quality control.
