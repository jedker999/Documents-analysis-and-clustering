Endogenous RNAs can form dsRNA either through an intramolecular duplex (hairpin dsRNA), or by base pairing RNAs transcribed in cis (convergent transcription) or in trans (from interspersed elements, pseudogenes etc.). The core mechanism of RNAi has three steps: dicing -cleavage of long dsRNA into siRNA duplexes by RNase III Dicer, loading -where one strand of siRNA duplex is selected and loaded onto an Argonaute protein forming the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and slicing -where siRNA guides RISC to cognate RNAs. Upon making a perfect duplex with a cognate RNA, AGO proteins perform endonucleolytic cleavage of the cognate RNA in the middle of the base paired sequence. In some species, RNAi also involves an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which may generate initial substrates or participate in amplification of the response by using cognate RNAs to synthesize dsRNA or small RNAs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 1 RNAi pathway overview"}, {"text": "Historically, the first discovered RNA silencing pathway was co-suppression in plants, which appeared as sequence-specific silencing of endogenous genes induced by transgene expression . The miRNA pathway was first found in 1993 in the nematode C. elegans (Lee et al., 1993) . The idea of a conserved miRNA pathway emerged after the identification Let-7 miRNA, which was reported in 2000 and is conserved from C. elegans to mammals . RNAi was described in the meantime also in C. elegans . Around the year 2000, it became apparent that 1.4.2. RNAi and miRNA pathway components 1.4.2.1 Substrates of RNA silencing and small RNAs RNA silencing employs different types of substrates ( Figure 2 ). Canonical precursors of miRNAs contain short hairpin structures, which are released by the Microprocessor complex and processed by Dicer in the cytoplasm. However, additional substrates can produce non-canonical miRNAs, which can be generated in Drosha-and/or Dicer-independent manner (reviewed in Kim et al., 2009; Winter et al., 2009 ). Long dsRNA substrates for RNAi may come in different forms; viral replication (and RdRP activities in general) often yields blunt-end dsRNA whereas hybridization of sense and antisense RNAs yields dsRNA with single-strand overhangs. Sense and antisense transcripts can be produced in cis by convergent transcription or in trans at separate loci. Another type of dsRNA are intramolecular duplexes of dsRNA hairpins, which form upon transcription of inverted repeat. In terms of long dsRNA formation, the most efficient is RdRP synthesis followed by forming intramolecular duplexes. Sense and antisense base pairing is less likely to occur in cis, especially when sense and antisense RNAs are produced at distant loci. The reason is that RNAs are usually forming intramolecular secondary structures and are bound by RNA binding proteins, which may reduce probability of base pairing of complementary RNAs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 274, "text": "(Lee et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF784"}, {"start": 577, "end": 584, "text": "1.4.2.1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 992, "end": 1009, "text": "Kim et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1029, "text": "Winter et al., 2009", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 682, "end": 690, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Figure 1 RNAi pathway overview"}, {"text": "Substrate types in RNA silencing pathways.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 2"}, {"text": "Dicer is the central enzyme for producing small RNAs in miRNA and RNAi pathways.

According to one model, ADAR1 interacts with Drosha and DGCR8 in the nucleus and possibly outcompetes DGCR8 in primary miRNA binding, thus enhancing mature miRNA expression. This appears dependent on ADAR1 editing activity, at least for a subset of targets (Bahn et al., 2015) . According to the selective elimination model, miRNAs, such as miR-151, are edited and eliminated by Tudor-SN (a ribonuclease specific to inosine-containing dsRNAs and a reported component of RISC) during mouse preimplantation development (Garcia-Lopez et al., 2013) .

Mammalian Dicers are much larger and contain domains absent in the Giardia Dicer but follow the same organizational and functional principles. The crystal structure of Giardia Dicer confirmed an earlier biochemical analysis predicting that the two RNase III domains of the human Dicer form an intramolecular dimer resulting in a single processing center placed at a specific distance from the PAZ domain (Zhang et al., 2004) . A structural component defining this distance is an \u03b1 helix (connector helix), which directly links PAZ and RNase III domains (MacRae et al., 2006b) . Thus, the key functional aspect that emerged from Dicer's structural analysis was that it functions as a molecular ruler, measuring the length of the substrate from the PAZ domain to RNase III domains where each domain cleaves one strand. Importantly, the mammalian Dicer (and metazoan Dicers in general) differ from Giardia's in two main aspects. The first is the general topology reflecting the fact that the typical mammalian Dicer product is shorter (21-23 nt) .

Thus, the head of the human Dicer is a topological equivalent of the base of the handle in Giardia's Dicer. The helicase domain constitutes the base, which has no equivalent in Giardia's Dicer.

However, despite the N-terminal helicase with conserved motifs important for ATP binding and hydrolysis is present in mammalian Dicers, there is no evidence of ATP requirement for the human Dicer activity (Provost et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002) . The human Dicer has the same processing efficiency in the presence or absence of ATP.

Conversely, inactivation of the RNase IIIB domain by mutation of D1709, a residue mutated in some cancers, produced complete loss of 5p-derived mature miRNAs, but only partial reduction in 3pderived mature miRNAs (Gurtan et al., 2012) . Mutation of the PAZ domain caused global reduction of miRNA processing, while mutation of the Walker A motif in the helicase domain of Dicer did not alter miRNA processing (Gurtan et al., 2012) . These results are consistent with the above mentioned structural features of Dicer. Pre-miRNAs are the most efficiently cleaved Dicer substrates in vitro. In contrast to long dsRNA, a canonical pre-miRNA is cleaved only once and releases a single small RNA duplex. Human Dicer alone cleaves pre-miRNAs much faster than pre-siRNA substrates under both single and multiple turnover conditions; with more than 100-fold difference in maximal cleavage rates (Vmax) under multiple turnover conditions (Chakravarthy et al., 2010) . This indicates that the mammalian Dicer is optimized for miRNA biogenesis and several specific structural adaptations discussed below support this notion.

Pre-miRNAs with the 2 nt 3' overhang at the 3' terminus are bound by Dicer with higher affinity than pre-miRNAs with different ends (Feng et al., 2012) . Moreover, the 2 nt 3'end overhang leads to a higher substrate processing, which was shown on both, pre-miRNAs and perfect duplexes (Zhang et al., 2004; Park et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2012) . Such preference is likely conferred by/due to simultaneous binding of pre-miRNA end by both 5' and 3' binding pockets in the PAZ domain (Park et al., 2011) . Importantly, fidelity of miRNA biogenesis is critical for miRNA functionality because a single nucleotide shift at the 5' end of a miRNA would redefine its target repertoire. In contrast, RNAi, which typically involves perfect complementarity between a small RNA and its target, would be essentially insensitive to a precise cleavage positioning as long as it would not affect Argonaute loading.

It was also reported that Gap junctions can serve for miRNA transfer from microvascular endothelial cells to colon cancer cells (Thuringer et al., 2016) . Circulating mammalian miRNAs were reported 2008 when they were found in serum of lymphoma patients; they were immediately recognized as potential non-invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnostics and treatment (Lawrie et al., 2008) . The same year, placental miRNAs were found circulating in maternal plasma , which was one of the discoveries leading to the notion that miRNAs could be a mobile regulating molecule (Iguchi et al., 2010) and that could even mediate transgenerational epigenetic heritance (Sharma, 2015) or be transmitted across species Buck et al., 2014) . Since then, extracellular miRNAs were identified in a broad range of biological fluids, including plasma, aqueous humour, cerebrospinal fluid, nasal mucus, or milk (Pegtel et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013b; Kropp et al., 2014; Baglio et al., 2015; Dismuke et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015a) . miRNAs were identified in the cargo of exosomes, membranous vesicles 40 to 100 nm in diameter, which are constitutively released by almost all cell type and are found essentially in every biological fluid (reviewed, for example, in (Rak, 2013; Yoon et al., 2014) However, extracellular miRNAs do not need to be necessarily encapsulated in extracellular vesicles, as two studies showed that 95-99% of extracellular miRNA are not in extracellular vesicles but associated with AGO proteins in serum and cell culture media (Arroyo et al., 2011; Turchinovich et al., 2011) . Furthermore, most individual exosomes in standard preparations do not seem to contain biologically significant numbers of miRNAs . The molecular mechanism of miRNA release, either as a cargo in a vesicle or free, is poorly understood and the current knowledge does not allow for building a coherent model as the literature is scarce. Non-templated nucleotide additions were found to distinguish between cellular miRNAs, which were 3' end adenylated in cells whereas 3' end uridylated isoforms appeared overrepresented in exosomes suggesting a possible role of 3' terminal modifications in sorting miRNAs into extracellular vesicles (Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 409, "text": "(Thuringer et al., 2016)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 619, "end": 640, "text": "(Lawrie et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF684"}, {"start": 824, "end": 845, "text": "(Iguchi et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 913, "end": 927, "text": "(Sharma, 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 961, "end": 979, "text": "Buck et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1167, "text": "(Pegtel et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF714"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1188, "text": "Huang et al., 2013b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1208, "text": "Kropp et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF679"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1229, "text": "Baglio et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF621"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1251, "text": "Dismuke et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF646"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1269, "text": "Wu et al., 2015a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1515, "text": "(Rak, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF716"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1534, "text": "Yoon et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF753"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1812, "text": "(Arroyo et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF619"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1839, "text": "Turchinovich et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF734"}, {"start": 2474, "end": 2502, "text": "(Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Extracellular microRNAs"}, {"text": "Recently, ALIX, an accessory protein of the endosomal sorting complex, it has been implicated in sorting miRNAs into extracellular vesicles based on its interaction with AGO2 and reduced miRNAs levels in extracellular vesicles upon Alix knock-down (Iavello et al., 2016) .

By that is meant that the protein factors present in every mammalian cells (Dicer, TARBP2, and AGO2) are competent to support RNAi but long dsRNA does not efficiently induce RNAi in most mammalian cells (Nejepinska et al., 2012b) .

This demonstrates that these three proteins constitute the essential core of RNAi mechanism although RNAi is not properly reconstituted when bona fide RNAi precursors were co-expressed (Wang et al., 2013a) . The problem is apparently at the level of Dicer processing as the human slicer AGO2 RNAi role is so conserved that it could function in RNAi in the early divergent protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, demonstrating conservation of basic features of the RNAi mechanism (Shi et al., 2006) . In an analogous experiment, human AGO2 could not replace Arabidopsis thaliana AGO1 in the miRNA pathway (Deveson et al., 2013) . In a sense, these different results are not that surprising considering the minimal requirements for RNAi and the complexity of the miRNA pathway, which provides a larger space for evolution of incompatible adaptations.

In contrast, female mice lacking functional piRNA pathway are fertile with no obvious defects in oocytes (Carmell et al., 2007) . Endo-siRNAs suppress TEs silencing in mammalian oocytes as documented by derepression of some retrotransposons in oocytes depleted of Dicer or AGO2 (Murchison et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2008) . As already proposed for invertebrates, the piRNA and endo-siRNA pathways likely cooperate in creating a complex silencing network against mobile elements in the mammalian germline. Long terminal repeat MT elements and SINE elements are strongly upregulated in Dicer -/oocytes, while the levels of IAP transposon are elevated in the absence of MILI protein but not in Dicer -/oocytes (Murchison et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2008) . Still many loci composed of other types of TEs, e.g. LINE retrotransposons, give rise to both piRNAs and endo-siRNAs, again suggesting that the biogenesis of these small RNAs is interdependent. The role of endogenous RNAi in TE silencing extends from germ cells to preimplantation embryo stages. Apart from maternally derived piRNAs and endo-siRNAs, which persist in the embryos for a large part of preimplantation development, zygotic endo-siRNAs are generated de novo mainly to control the activity of zygotically activated MuERV-L retrotransposon (Svoboda et al., 2004; Ohnishi et al., 2010) .

Whether these SINE endo-siRNAs play an active role in TE silencing in mESCs similarly to other TE-derived endo-siRNAs in oocytes remains to be determined.

The natural antisense transcription in somatic cells, which has a potential to generate dsRNA, yields low levels of endo-siRNAs, whose biological relevance is questionable. At the same time, endo-siRNAs derived from natural antisense transcripts of Slc34a gene were identified in mouse kidney, where Na/phosphate cotransporter exerts its physiological function (Carlile et al., 2009 ). However, changes in expression levels of Slc34a upon suppression of the endo-siRNA pathway have not been addressed. In mouse hippocampus, deep sequencing revealed a set of potential endo-siRNAs generated from overlapping sense/antisense transcripts and from hairpin structures within introns of protein-coding genes (Smalheiser et al., 2011) . The most abundant endo-siRNAs from SynGAP1 gene locus were also found in complexes with AGO proteins and FMRP in vivo. Interestingly, a large part of potential hippocampal endo-siRNA targets encode for proteins involved in the control of synaptic plasticity and the number of endo-siRNAs derived from these gene loci increased significantly during olfactory discrimination training (Smalheiser et al., 2011) . Given the fact that vast majority of identified endo-siRNA sequences mapped to intronic regions, the endo-siRNAs could act co-transcriptionally on nuclear pre-mRNAs, perhaps similarly to the mechanism of RNAi-mediated inhibition of RNA Pol II elongation described in C. elegans (Guang et al., 2010) . Alternatively, endo-siRNAs could control correct distribution of target mRNAs as unspliced pre-mRNA can be exported from the neuronal nucleus and transported to dendrites for processing (Glanzer et al., 2005) .

Since viruses coevolve with different hosts and explore all possible strategies to maintain and increase their fitness, it is not surprising that viral reproductive strategies come into contact with mammalian RNA silencing pathways, particularly the miRNA pathway, which shares components with the RNAi pathway. Another evidence for an interaction between viruses and RNA silencing is the presence of putative suppressors of RNA silencing (SRS) in various viruses. As viral genomes rapidly evolve, SRS should be functionally relevant. For example, B2 protein in Nodaviruses (e.g. FHV) is essential for replication, inhibits Dicer function, and B2-deficient FHV can be rescued by artificial inhibition of RNAi response (Li et al., 2002) .

For example, the Dengue virus, whose life cycle takes place in humans and mosquitoes, is targeted by RNAi in mosquitoes and it likely evolved an adaptation to circumvent RNAi (Sanchez-Vargas et al., 2009) .

Pioneering RNAi work indicated that silencing occurs in the cytoplasm because dsRNA against intronic sequences had no silencing effect and the RISC complex co-purified with ribosomes . Early studies in mammalian cells also suggested that RNAi is cytoplasmic (Billy et al., 2001; Zeng et al., 2002) .

Thus, despite the collection of the reports below, one should still approach the nuclear aspect cautiously. One of the earlier implications for nuclear localization of Dicer was the reported Dicer-dependent turnover of intergenic transcripts from the human beta-globin gene cluster (Haussecker and Proudfoot, 2005) . However, this study showed mostly correlation of abundance of nuclear transcripts. Nuclear Dicer processing was also implicated by several other studies (Valen et al., 2011; Flemr et al., 2013; White et al., 2014; Neve et al., 2016) .

(White et al., 2014), selection of alternative polyadenylation sites (Neve et al., 2016) or rRNA processing (Liang and Crooke, 2011) . Several studies documented Dicer nuclear localization by microscopy. Dicer was detected in cultured mammalian cells with several different antibodies in the chromatin where it resided in rDNA clusters on acrocentric human chromosomes (Sinkkonen et al., 2010) . Finer mapping using chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that Dicer localizes in the proximity of the rRNA transcribed region (Sinkkonen et al., 2010) . However, this study failed to reveal any functional significance of Dicer localization and it is not clear if the localization is related to the later reported role of Dicer in pre-rRNA processing (Liang and Crooke, 2011) or to rDNA-derived small RNAs (Wei et al., 2013) .

FCS/FCCS identified Dicer in the nucleus in HeLa cells and suggested that nuclear Dicer is alone while the cytoplasmic Dicer exists in a large complex with AGO2 (presumably RLC) (Ohrt et al., 2012) . This would imply that while Dicer could process nuclear substrates, they would not be loaded on AGO proteins in the nucleus. However, a later study suggested that Dicer, TARBP2, AGO2 and GW182 associate into a large complex in the nucleus although, consistently with FCS/FCCS data, loading of nuclear small RNA duplexes was not detected (Gagnon et al., 2014a) . Regarding the nuclear localization mechanism of Dicer, it does not employ a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS). A pyruvate kinase fusion system suggested that dsRBP of Dicer could function as an NLS similarly to ADAR dsRBD (Doyle et al., 2013) . However, this study did not prove nuclear localization of full-length Dicer under physiological conditions. Interestingly, an additional report implied phosphorylation of Dicer in nuclear localization in nematodes, humans and mice (Drake et al., 2014) .

Bird ancestors branched of mammalian ancestors over 300 MYA when the synapsid lineage leading to mammals branched of the sauropsid lineage leading to dinosaurs and birds. During their evolution, birds evolved numerous physiological adaptations in which they differ from mammals, including feathers, shelled eggs with external development, or different sex chromosome system, to name a few. At the same time, they are the closest mammal-related group covered in this report, in terms of synteny and sequence similarity. This is helpful for assessing features of dsRNA and miRNA pathways.

Drosophila Pasha is possibly phosphorylated by ERK/MAPK, as suggested by phosphorylation of human DGCR8 in insect cells; the phosphorylation appears to increase protein stability without altering miRNA processing activity (Herbert et al., 2013) . miRNA biogenesis in Drosophila also involves SmD1, a component of the Drosophila small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), which interacts with both the microprocessor component Pasha and pri-miRNAs, and is indispensable for optimal miRNA biogenesis In terms of evolutionary diversity of the Microprocessor complex in arthropods, the miRNA pathway seemed to expand in the pea aphid (insect, Hemiptera), whose genome carries four expressed copies of Pasha (Jaubert-Possamai et al., 2010) . At the same time, the brown planthopper (insect, Hemiptera), the fall armyworm (insect, Lepidoptera) or the desert locust (insect, Orthoptera) all have a single Pasha (Xu et al., 2013; Ghosh et al., 2014; Wynant et al., 2015) , which appears the common case among arthropods when browsing available genome databases. Analysis of Pasha in Litopenaeus vannamei ( shrimp) revealed high sequence conservation and nuclear localization, suggesting a wellconserved role in miRNA biogenesis . Conservation of miRNA pathway in shrimps is further supported by requirement for Drosha, Dicer1 and Ago1 for production of viral RNAs in infected shrimps (He and Huang et al., 2012) .

Subsequent molecular analysis proposed a model where the N-terminal helicase domain is suppressing DNase activity and release of the C-terminal part upon cleavage at Asp1472 (within the RNAse IIIa domain) by CED-3 activates a DNA-binding activity and enables DNA cleavage (Ge et al., 2014) .

Model viral infections were based on the (+)ssRNA flock house virus (FHV) (Lu et al., 2005) or the (-)ssRNA vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Schott et al., 2005; Wilkins et al., 2005) . Infection with the recombinant VSV was augmented in strong RNAi mutant animals (rde-1 and rde-4), which produced higher viral titers. Furthermore, VSV infection was attenuated in rrf-3 and eri-1 mutants that are hypersensitive to RNAi (Wilkins et al., 2005) . Similar results were obtained from infected cultured cells (Schott et al., 2005) and FHV infection of rde-1 mutants (Lu et al., 2005) . Not surprisingly, genes misregulated in C. elegans deficient in Dicer, RDE-4, or RDE-1 are enriched for innate immunity genes (Welker et al., 2007) . Antiviral RNAi involves also other genes, such as rsd-2 (RNAi spreading defective 2), which was implicated in secondary viral siRNA biogenesis in RDE-4 independent manner (Guo et al., 2013b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 462, "text": "(Lu et al., 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 512, "end": 533, "text": "(Schott et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 534, "end": 555, "text": "Wilkins et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 793, "end": 815, "text": "(Wilkins et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 877, "end": 898, "text": "(Schott et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 934, "end": 951, "text": "(Lu et al., 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1101, "text": "(Welker et al., 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1294, "text": "(Guo et al., 2013b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antiviral RNAi"}, {"text": "The antiviral role of exo-RNAi was subsequently confirmed in a natural viral infection of C. elegans and C. briggsae by Orsay virus (Felix et al., 2011) .

Interestingly, genome-wide association study in C. elegans wild populations identified as a major determinant of viral sensitivity DRH-1, the aforementioned RIG-1 homolog . Similarly, a genetic analysis revealed an essential role for both DRH-1 and DRH-3 in antiviral RNAi (Guo et al., 2013a) .

DRH-3 binds both single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs with high affinity. However, the ATPase activity of DRH-3 is stimulated only by double-stranded RNA (Matranga and Pyle, 2010).

In species, which still use RNAi as the primary antiviral immunity pathway (such as plants, nematodes, arthropods), it is frequently observed that viruses overcome the RNAi response with various protein inhibitors. Whether the more complex interferon system in vertebrates provides a stronger defense barrier is unclear as the interferon pathway is just a part of a highly complex immune system.

Understanding the role of the RNAi module in immunity of molluscs and annelids requires further research.

First, for an RNA silencing mechanism, which utilizes a small RNA bound to an AGO protein, recognition of a small RNA target may require as little as the seed sequence, which is a hexamer or heptamer motif. Thus, for predicting targets and estimating a potential impact of a small RNA, one has to consider all potential binding sites. A small RNA could have hundreds to thousands of putative binding sites in the transcriptome. Accordingly, reliability of target prediction remains an unsolved issue and needs to be complemented with experimental validation. Second, stoichiometry between the loaded AGO and cognate RNA is important for effective silencing while structural analyses and single molecule studies provide a framework for estimating how effective a target recognition could be.

Since miRNA-mediated repression follows the same principles and some of the key kinetic parameters were estimated (Figure 23 ), one could use whole animal models to test a given concentration if there is any detectable effect, where the most sensitive monitoring would analyze transcriptome changes. Such analysis would simply show, which small RNA concentration has a measurable effect on gene expression in vivo.

Direct target transcripts displaced by anti-miR are then identified based on their depletion from IP fraction (Androsavich and Chau, 2014) The immunoprecipitation strategy was further developed into a number of methods for isolation of small RNAs bound to their targets, which include high throughput sequencing of crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) and crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) methods (reviewed more detail in (Jaskiewicz et al., 2012; Broughton and Pasquinelli, 2016) ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 350, "text": "(Easow et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF309"}, {"start": 351, "end": 373, "text": "Karginov et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF382"}, {"start": 374, "end": 398, "text": "Hendrickson et al., 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF352"}, {"start": 719, "end": 747, "text": "(Androsavich and Chau, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1087, "text": "(Jaskiewicz et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF371"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1120, "text": "Broughton and Pasquinelli, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunoprecipitation of small RNA:target RNA complexes"}, {"text": "There are several modifications of the basic HITS-CLIP.

Thus, a plant miRNA operating in mammalian cells must either remain with its plant AGO protein, which would have to be compatible with mammalian components required for miRNA function, or be unloaded and reloaded onto a mammalian Argonaute protein. Importantly, plant miRNAs are methylated at their 3' end while mammalian miRNAs are not. Data by Zhang et al. suggest that plant miRNAs detected in mammalian serum are indeed methylated (Figure 1 in ). However, mammalian 3' small RNA methylation concerns only piRNAs, a distinct class of small RNAs produced from sense and antisense RNAs. piRNAs are longer (24-30 nt) than siRNAs or miRNAs and are loaded onto a distinct subfamily of Argonaute proteins named PIWI (reviewed in (Peters and Meister, 2007) ). PIWI proteins are expressed in the germline but not in mammalian somatic cells. In contrast, miRNA and siRNA-binding Argonaute proteins (AGO subfamily) do not bind small RNAs methylated at the 3' end. (Tian et al., 2011 ).

The canonical miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation requires appropriate stoichiometry between miRNAs and their targets (section 3.2.2.1.). However, the evidence that plant miRNAs would reach such physiologically active levels in liver cells is questionable. Plant miRNAs were detected in the serum at femtomolar concentrations (~3-16 fM), which was one order of magnitude less than the serum level of endogenous miRNAs . Total circulating miRNA concentration in human plasma ranges were estimated to be 68-250 fM . At this concentration, human circulating miRNAs are considered unlikely to regulate gene expression by canonical miRNA activity as miRNAs are thought to require intracellular levels greater than 1000 copies per cell to exert measurable activity (Brown et al., 2007; Hafner et al., 2011) . In fact, miR-122, a highly abundant miRNA regulating gene expression in the liver, has been estimated to be expressed at 120,000 molecules/hepatocyte (one of the highest miRNA amounts/cell) while less expressed miR-33 and miR-16 were estimated to be expressed at 1,200 and 11,000 copies/hepatocyte, respectively (Bissels et al., 2009; Denzler et al., 2014) . These numbers contrasts with estimates for xenogenic miRNAs. As 10 femtomoles of miRNAs are approximately 6x10 9 molecules, an extracellular concentration of 10 fM corresponds to 6 molecules per nanoliter of serum. A somatic cell volume is up to several picoliters. Thus, unless there is yet unknown active transport of circulating miRNAs into hepatocytes, xenogenic miRNAs entering the circulatory system have no capacity to regulate gene expression by canonical miRNA activity in the liver. Yet, Zhang et al. argue that MIR168a abundance in the liver tissue is equivalent to 853 copies per cell. The ongoing debate on stoichiometry, which is discussed later, has been inconclusive.

For comparison, the right graph shows size distribution of 721 high-confidence murine miRNAs.Dicer-1 differs from Dicer-2 in substrate specificities and ATP requirements(Jiang et al., 2005). Like human Dicer, Dicer-1 generates small RNAs in an ATP-independent manner(Jiang et al., 2005), whereas Dicer-2 or Dicer-2/R2D2 required ATP hydrolysis for efficient siRNA production(Liu et al.,  2003). Dicer-1 shows a preference for pre-miRNAs(Jiang et al., 2005; Tsutsumi et al., 2011). It recognizes the single-stranded terminal loop structure of pre-miRNAs through its N-terminal helicase domain, checks the loop size and measures the distance between the 3\u2032 overhang and the terminal loop -this allows Dicer-1 to inspect the authenticity of pre-miRNA structures(Tsutsumi et al., 2011).In terms of evolutionary diversity of Dicer-1 in arthropods, as mentioned above, the miRNA pathway seemed to expand in pea aphid (insect, Hemiptera) which utilizes two active copies of Dicer 1(Jaubert-Possamai et al., 2010; Ortiz-Rivas et al., 2012).

Importantly, viruses facing RNAi-based innate immunity evolve different RNAi inhibitors, proteins, which interfere with various stages of siRNA biogenesis. Such proteins have been identified in most of the aforementioned viruses. Needless to say that antiviral RNAi was reported also from other hexapods, such as silk moth Zografidis et al., 2015).

The platform domain is adjacent to the RNase IIIa domain and makes up the upper part of the handle. The PAZ domain is connected by a long helix to the RNase IIIa domain and forms the base of the handle(MacRae et al., 2006b). Altogether, the Giardia Dicer is formed of three rigid regions, which are linked by flexible hinges. One region is formed by RNase III domains and the bridging domain, the second by the platform domain and the connector helix, and the third by the PAZ domain. These three parts can swing relative to each other and possibly ensure accommodation of Dicer to the structure of its substrate(MacRae et al., 2006a). This conformational flexibility likely enables binding of dsRNAs with non-canonical base pairing as well as imperfect duplexes of pre-miRNAs(MacRae et al., 2006a). In addition, dsRNA binding is presumably stabilized by several positively charged patches on the surface of Giardia Dicer between the processing center and the PAZ domain, which are in contact with dsRNA(MacRae et al., 2006a; MacRae et al., 2007).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF29": {"text": "Domain order.

The interferon pathway is the most ubiquitous sequence-independent pathway induced by dsRNA in mammalian cells (reviewed in detail inde Veer et al., 2005). Among the relevant sensors recognizing cytoplasmic dsRNA are protein kinase R (PKR), the helicase RIG-I, MDA5, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-OAS), or Toll-like receptors (TLR3, 7, 8) (reviewed in Gantier andWilliams, 2007; Sadler and Williams, 2007). Notably, there are also dsRNA-independent mechanisms that can activate interferons in mammalian cells. Altogether, different stimuli are being sensed and converge on activation of overlapping but distinct sets of ISGs(Geiss et al., 2001). The situation is even more convoluted by cellular diversity as some cell types, particularly immune cells, can elicit the interferon response by additional, cell-type-specific pathways (reviewed inSchlee and Hartmann, 2010). PKR is the oldest known mammalian dsRNA sensing protein.

This was shown, for example, during experiments with systematically generated artificial miRNAs targeting a desired gene . It turned out that seed-based artificial miRNA design was highly inefficient, as the majority of miRNAs with even perfect seed matches did not repress either target. Moreover, commonly used target prediction programs had problems to discriminate effective artificial miRNAs from ineffective ones, indicating that current algorithms do not fully accommodate important miRNA features allowing for designing artificial miRNAs . Another unresolved issue is reliable prediction of non-canonical (non-seed) miRNA binding sites as most algorithms are based on detection of seed-based miRNA binding sites.

The transmission of co-suppression occurs when silenced stocks and non-silenced target scions are physically separated by up to 30 cm of stem lacking cognate RNAs (Palauqui et al., 1997) . The systemic movement of the silencing signal takes days and typically moves from leaves (photosynthetic source) to roots and growing points (sucrose sinks) ; this flow is characteristic of phloem (discussed in (Turgeon and Wolf, 2009; De Schepper et al., 2013) ). Furthermore, phloem transport blocked by cadmium inhibits systemic silencing spread (Beclin et al., 1998; Ghoshroy et al., 1998) . Later, it was also shown that phloem flow strongly influences the systemic spread of silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana and that the direction of systemic spread of silencing from inducer to sensor can be manipulated by altering sink/source relations in the plant (Tournier et al., 2006) . Thus, systemic silencing is not an accidental EFSA Supporting publication 2017:EN-1246The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Consistent with phloem movement, another analysis of miR399 movement using reciprocal grafting in Arabidopsis suggested that it moves from shoots to roots (Lin et al., 2008) .The basis of selectivity underlying miRNA mobility in plants remains unclear.
