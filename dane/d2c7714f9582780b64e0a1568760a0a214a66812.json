Receptor activation mediates a variety of functions, including contraction of smooth muscle, cardiac stimulation, cellular proliferation and activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. In the CNS, the activation of \u03b1 1 -adrenoceptors results in depolarization and increased neuronal firing rate.",

A constant concentration of the radioligand 3 H-prazosin (0.2-0.3 nM) is incubated with increasing concentrations of a non-labeled test drug (0.1 nM-1 mM) in the presence of plasma membranes from rat heart ventricles. If the test drug exhibits any affinity to \u03b1-adrenoceptors, it is able to compete with the radioligand for receptor binding \u00e4sites. Thus, the lower the concentration range of the test drug, in which the competition reaction occurs, the more potent is the test drug. The assay is used to evaluate the concentrationbinding characteristics of drugs atria the \u03b1 1 -adrenoceptor. ",

The membrane suspension is immediately stored in aliquots of 5-20 ml at -77\u00b0C. Protein content of the membrane suspension is determined according to the method of Lowry et al. with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

The most extensively characterized action is the prejunctionally mediated inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters from many peripheral and central neurons. \u03b1 2 -adrenoceptors are also present at postjunctional sites, where they mediate actions such as smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation and inhibition of insulin secretion. Activation of postsynaptic \u03b1 2adrenoceptors in the brainstem results in an inhibition of sympathetic outflow in the periphery.",

Clonidine can, however, act at both peripheral and central \u03b1 2 -receptors. Peripherally administered clonidine causes a brief increase in blood pressure followed by a prolonged decrease (Rand and Wilson 1968) . Functional studies ( 3 H-NE release) indicate a presynaptic mechanism for clonidine (Langer 1977 (Langer , 1981 Starke 1977) . However, lesioning studies fail to confirm a presynaptic location for clonidine receptors in either the CNS or periphery (U'Prichard et al. 1979; Bylund and Martinez 1981; U'Prichard et al. 1980) . No change in clonidine receptor sites was seen after 6hydroxydopamine lesions in cerebral cortex. This may be due to the fact that \u03b1 2 -receptors are both pre-and postsynaptic (Hieble et al. 1988) .",

Incubations are initiated by the addition of membrane suspension and carried out for 40 min at 25\u00b0C. Nonspecific binding is defined in the presence of either piperoxan or phentolamine (0.1 mM), which are imidazoline-adrenergic agents. Specific \u03b1 2 -adrenergic binding is defined by epinephrine (0.1 mM). In experiments with catecholamines, all samples contain ascorbic acid in a final concentration of 0.001%. Incubations are terminated by vacuum filtration over Reeves-Angel or Whatman GF/C fiberglass filters using a cell harvester (Brandel) . The filters are washed four times with 5 ml ice-cold Tris-HCl, placed in scintillation vials, covered with 4 ml scintillation cocktail and counted at 50% efficiency. Protein is assayed by a modified Lowry et al. method (Peterson 1977) using a deoxycholate-trichloroacetic acid protein precipitation technique which provides a rapid quantitative recovery of soluble and membrane proteins from interfering substances even in very dilute solutions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate is added to alleviate possible nonionic and cationic detergent and lipid interferences, and to provide mild conditions for rapid denaturation of membrane and proteolipid proteins.",

Thus, the lower the concentration range of the test drug, in which the competition reaction occurs, the more effective is the test drug. The binding reaction is started by adding 100 \u00b5l membrane suspension per incubation sample (approx. 2 mg protein/ml). The samples are incubated for 60 min in a shaking water bath at 25\u00b0C. The reaction is stopped by rapid vacuum filtration of the total incubation volume over glass fiber filters. Thereby the membranebound radioactivity is separated from the free activity. Filters are washed immediately with approx. 20 ml icecold rinse buffer per sample. The retained membranebound radioactivity on the filter is measured after addition of 2 ml liquid scintillation cocktail per sample in a Packard liquid scintillation counter.",

(1986) recommended CGP 20712 A as a useful tool for quantitating \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 adrenoceptors. Lands et al. (1967) classified \u03b2-receptors into \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 subtypes according to differences in the action of various catecholamines. Synthesis of more selective \u03b2-antagonists has helped to confirm the existence of receptor subtypes. Based on catecholamine pharmacology and differences in the tissue distribution, it has been suggested that the \u03b2 1 -receptor serves as the receptor for norepinephrine acting as a neurotransmitter and the \u03b2 2 -receptor serves as a receptor for epinephrine acting as a hormone. (Nahorski 1981; Ariens and Simonis 1983; Lefkowitz et al. 1983; Minneman 1983 ). Since [ 3 H]-dihydroalprenolol is a nonspecific ligand, it is necessary to select a tissue which is enriched in \u03b2 2 -receptors in order to convey specificity to this assay. Tissues with predominantly \u03b2 2receptors include lung (U'Prichard et al. 1978; Ariens and Simonis 1983; Lefkowitz et al. 1983 ), cerebellum (Lefkowitz et al. 1983 Minneman et al. 1983 ), rat and frog erythrocytes (Mukherjee et al. 1975; Lefkowitz et al. 1983 ) and ciliary process (Nathanson 1985) whereas, forebrain, heart and avian erythrocytes are relatively enriched in the \u03b2 1 -subtype (Lefkowitz et al. 1983 ). Due to poor binding characteristics in cerebellum, rat lung is chosen as the tissue for \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors.",

It was discovered that adenosine could either inhibit or stimulate the formation of cAMP. The discovery of dual effects on adenylate cyclase led to the proposal of two distinct adenosine receptors referred to as the A 1 and A 2 receptors. The A 1 subtype of adenosine receptor mediates the inhibition of adenylate cyclase; whereas, the A 2 subtype mediates stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The methylxanthines are relatively nonselective inhibitors of adenosine receptor subtypes and their pharmacological properties are thought to be mostly due to antagonism of these receptors.",

It plays a potent neuromodulatory role mainly by inhibiting the presynaptic transmitter release, e. g. of glutamate and aspartate. It is released by synaptic stimulation and during hypoxia in the central and peripheral nervous system. Adenosine plays a neuroprotective role in hypoxia and ischemia since it reduces the excessive stimulation of the NMDA receptors. The use of adenosine uptake inhibitors has been proposed as a new therapeutic strategy for hypoxic/ischemic disease. Due to its vasodilatory action adenosine plays a key role in the regulation of coronary and cerebral blood flow. The rapid cellular uptake of adenosine by erythrocytes is a reason for the short duration of action of adenosine. Human erythrocytes are used as a cellular model to detect adenosine uptake inhibitors. Erythrocytes are treated with test compound and thereafter incubated with 3 H-adenosine. The uptake of 3 H-adenosine is evaluated in relation to the untreated control group.",

Dumoulin et al.

Hubner et al. (2001) reported in-vitro and in-vivo inhibition of rat neutral endopeptidase and ACE with the vasopeptidase inhibitor gemopatrilat. Dumoulin et al.

Arterial pressure is measured continuously by connecting the arterial catheter to transducer coupled to a Gould pressure transducer. The output is recorded on a polygraph. Mean arterial pressure is derived electronically. After a 30-45 min stabilization period, autonomic transmission is blocked by treatment with mecamylamine (3 mg/kg i.v.) and atropine (0.4 mg/kg i.v.). After arterial pressure has stabilized, angiotensin is infused i.v. in isotonic saline with a syringe pump. When the pressure response to angiotensin has stabilized, angiotensin II antagonists are given in increasing doses. The doses are given intravenously in a cumulative fashion, i. e., the next highest dose is given at the time of maximum response to the prior dose.",

To be relevant for humans human renin has to be used. One of the reasons that human renin is specific for human angiotensinogen lies in the sequence of human angiotensinogen itself. Inhibition of renin is measured by angiotensinogen formed in the presence of angiotensinase inhibitors. The following procedure is used to determine the effect of potential renin inhibitors on purified human kidney renin without interference from plasma proteins or lipids.",

Human angiotensinogen (0.2 \u00b5M) may be used as a substrate instead of the tetradekapeptide. The pH value of the incubation mixture may be lowered to 6.0 by using a maleic acid buffer; this results in higher renin activity.

            "text": "Inhibition of plasma renin activity in blood samples from various species can be determined in order to evaluate the species specificity of a renin inhibitor Blood samples are obtained from dogs, sheep and rhesus monkeys by venipuncture. Wistar rats and guinea pigs are anesthetized with Nembutal (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and the blood is collected by puncture of the abdominal aorta. Human blood is collected from volunteers (Donafix blood collecting set, Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, FR Germany) in cooled bottles. All blood samples are anticoagulated with Na-EDTA (final concentration 10-15 mM). The renin is dissolved in DMSO as 10 \u22122 M stock solution and diluted before each experiment in DMSO. The endogenous formation of ANG I in plasma during incubation at 37\u00b0C is determined as the measure of renin activity. Generation and quantitation of ANG I are performed using a commercial radio immunoassay kit (Renin-MAIA, Serono Diagnostika GmbH, Freiburg, FR Germany). Plasma samples are thawed on ice and centrifuged after addition of 100 \u00b5l PMSF solution (kit) per 10 ml. The assay mixture contains 450 \u00b5l plasma plus 1% (v/v) PMSF solution, 45 \u00b5l buffer (phosphate buffer, pH = 7.4, + 10 \u22125 M ramiprilate) and 5 \u00b5l renin inhibitor solution (diluted in DMSO as required) or pure DMSO for controls. The assay is incubated for an appropriate time (2-3 hours) at 37\u00b0C. ANG I is measured in 100 \u00b5l samples (triplicate determinations). Basal ANG I immunoreactivity of the plasma is determined from an unincubated control assay (0\u00b0C). This pre-incubation value is subtracted from all measurements. The renin activity in the presence of the renin inhibitor is calculated as percent activity in relation to control samples containing only DMSO. The IC 50 value is determined from a semilogarithmic plot of percent renin activity versus concentration of the renin inhibitor. Wood et al. (1990) determined the activity of a synthetic renin inhibitor against rat, mouse, dog, guinea pig, rabbit, cat, marmoset and human renin using plasma pools from these species. Plasma from each species was collected using EDTA as an anticoagulant. Samples of plasma were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of test compound. The ANG I formed was measured by radioimmunoassay. Shibasaki et al. (1991) used squirrel monkeys to study the in vivo activity of a specific renin inhibitor after intravenous and oral application. Bohlender et al. (1996) reconstructed the human renin-angiotensin system in transgenic rats overexpressing the human angiotensin gene TGR(hOGEN) 1623 by chronically injecting human recombinant renin intravenously using Alzet pumps. Salimbeni et al. (1996) tested the in vitro inhibition of human plasma renin activity by two synthetic angiotensinogen transition state analogues. Wood et al. (2003) determined the inhibitory potency of an orally effective renin inhibitor in vitro against human renin. Human recombinant renin (0.33 ng/ml) was incubated with a synthetic tetradecapeptide substrate (TDP, 13.33 \u00b5M) corresponding to the 14 terminal amino acids of human angiotensinogen, in 0.33 M Tes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1% human serum albumin and 0.1% neomycin sulphate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml ice-cold 0.1 M Tris-acetate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% HSA. The angiotensin generated during the incubation was measured by radioimmunoassay. The oral activity was confirmed in hypertensive patients (Gradman et al. 2005) .",

Nitric oxide plays a role in a wide range of physiological processes including regulation of blood flow and arterial pressure via endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels (Rees et al. 1989; Moncada et al. 1991; Umans and Levi 1995; Huraux et al. 1999; McIntyre et al. 1999; Zanzinger 1999; Hropot et al. 2003) , ischemia/reperfusion injury (Gao et al. 2002; Schulz et al. 2004) , peripheral nitregric transmission at smooth muscle (Rand and Li 1995) , intracellular communication in the CNS with activation of guanylyl cyclase in target neurons (Southam and Garthwaite 993), experimental stroke (Willmot et al. 2005) , learning and memory (Susswein et al. 2004) , in neurogenic inflammation (Kajekar et al. 1995) , in the regulation of leukocyte recruitment (Hickey 2001), and macrophage defense mechanisms following exposure to bacterial products (F\u00f6rstermann et al. 1992; F\u00f6rstermann and Kleinert 1995; Moncada 1994). Fiorucci et al. (2002) discussed the effects of nitric oxide-releasing NSAIDs.",

These segments serve as donor tissue for EDRF. Circumferential aorta strips from the abdominal aorta of untreated control rabbits are de-endothelialized by gently blotting their luminal surfaces on wet filter paper. These denuded abdominal aorta strips are pinned opposite the donor segments (intimal surface facing intimal surface) and function as detector for luminally released EDRF. Each sandwich preparation is suspended in a 40-ml organ bath, filled with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer at 37\u00b0C containing 10 mM indomethacin. After connecting the detector strip to a force transducer, the angle between the detector strip and the donor segment is minimized and the distance between donor and detector tissue standardized. After one hour stabilization, the strips are brought to their optimum length-tension relationship by repeated exposure to 80 mM KCl. When a stable contractile response is established, the strips are precontracted with phenylephrine to 80-100% of their KCl-induced contraction.

Care is taken to avoid damage of the endothelium. The aorta is divided into 2 mm wide rings and cut off in small strips. From some strips, the endothelium is removed by gently rubbing the intimal surfaces between the fingers for approximately 30 s. The strips are suspended in a 25 ml organ bath containing Krebs-bicarbonate solution at 37\u00b0C being gassed continuously with 5% CO 2 /95% O 2 . Contractions of the strips are recorded isometrically with a load of 2 g on the tissues. After an equilibration period of 2 h a stable baseline tone is reached.",

When a stable contraction plateau has been reached, the vasodilating agent is added in various concentrations. In these concentrations, norepinephrine, angiotensin II and KCl evoke a response of 60-80% of maximal contraction in intact rings of rabbit aorta. Rings without endothelium exhibit a response which is significantly enhanced in comparison with the response of the intact preparation after norepinephrine and angiotensin II precontraction.",

In endothelium-intact rings, acetylcholine relaxes contractions induced by norepinephrine or angiotensin II. In precontracted rings devoid of endothelium, acetylcholine does not show any relaxing effect or causes contractions by itself at higher concentrations (Furchgott and Zawadzki 1980). As an example, atriopeptin III causes a similar concentration-dependent relaxation of all precontracted preparations with intact and with functionally destroyed endothelium indicating a direct effect on the smooth muscle cells. The relaxation is accompanied by an increase of cGMP.",

Fujimoto et al. (1992) used the thoracic aorta from rats to study the effects between endothelin and an endothelin receptor antagonist. In transverse strips from ratthoracic aorta, 2 mm wide and 4-5 mm long, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the interior surface of the aorta. Concentration-response curves of contractions after ET-1 in the presence and the absence of the inhibitor were compared. Pellisier et al. (1992) perfused the isolated mesenteric vascular bed of the rat with Tyrode solution and measured the perfusion pressure after injection of graded doses of norepinephrine and the dose-dependent relaxation due to acetylcholine in the vascular bed precontracted by norepinephrine infusion. In order to destroy the endothelial layer, the perfusate was changed to a hypotonic Tyrode solution containing all of the constituents present in normal Tyrode solution but in one-tenth of the concentration resulting in disruption of more than 95% of the endothelial cells. The effect of norepinephrine was enhanced, whereas the effect of acetylcholine was abolished.",

NOS can be inhibited by several routes, e. g., competition with L-arginine, NADPH, flavin or tetrahydrobiopterin, interaction of the haeme group of NOS, interference with Ca 2+ availability or calmodulin binding to the enzyme (Fukuto and Chaudhuri 1995). A widely used inhibitor is L-NAME (Vargas et al. 1991) . Selective inhibition of constitutive NOS can by achieved by 7-nitroindazole (Moore et al. 1993) ; of the inducible NOS by aminoguanidine hydrochloride (Griffiths et al. 1993 ) and by 2-amino-5,6dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine ( = AMT) (Nakane et al. 1995) .

After denudation of the endothelium of carotid arteries by balloon injury, endothelial cell nitric oxidase expression in the vessel wall was restored by using the Sendai virus/liposome in vivo gene transfer technique. Lund et al. (2000) found that gene transfer of endothelial nitric oxide synthase improves relaxation of carotid arteries from diabetic rabbits. Mungrue et al. (2002) discussed lessons from murine genetic models on the role of NOS in heart failure. Rho is a member of the Ras-related family of small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, and Rho works as a molecular switch by shuttling between the GDP-bound inactive form and the GTP-bound active form. Rho is involved in cell motility, cell adhesion, cytokinesis, Ras-induced transformation, transcriptional activation, and cell cycle progression. These actions, through Rho signaling, are mediated by downstream Rho effectors, such as the ROCK family of Rho-associated serine/threonine protein kinases. Studies with ROCK-specific inhibitors indicate that the ROCK pathway works in the contraction of vascular smooth muscle. Several studies indicate that Rhokinase may be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (Kobayashi et al. 2002; Shimokawa 2002; Ito et al. 2003 Ito et al. , 2004 Nakakuki et al. 2005; Budzyn et al. 2006; Winaver et al. 2006) .

A vicious circle leads to a further decrease of intracellular pH and to a further activation of Na + /H + exchange, resulting in energy depletion, cellular Na + overload and finally due to the coupling of Na + and Ca 2+ transport via Na + /Ca 2+ exchange, cellular Ca 2+ overload (Lazdunski et al. 1985; Tani and Neely 1990; Scholz and Albus 1993) . Especially in ischemic cardiac tissue, where Na + /H + exchange is the predominant pH regulating ion transport system (Weissenberg et al. 1989 ), these pathological events can lead to increased excitability and precipitation of cellular death. Therefore, it is desirable to find potent and well tolerated inhibitors of Na + /H + exchange which should be able to interrupt this vicious cycle, to conserve cellular energy stores and to diminish cellular excitability and necrosis during cardiac ischemia. Such effects have been found with relatively weak inhibitors of Na + /H + exchange at high toxic doses, such as amiloride and ethyl isopropyl amiloride (Scholz et al. 1992) .",

Coagulation is inhibited by 0.8 ml citrate acid dextrose (65 mM citric acid, 11 mM glucose, 85 mM trisodium citrate). Plateletrich plasma (PRP) is obtained by centrifugation of whole blood at 90 g for 10 min at room temperature. Platelet count is measured, e. g., with a Casey 1 multichannelyser (Sch\u00e4rfe System, Reutlingen, Germany). Each of the experiments is performed with 10-50 \u00b5l PRP containing 20 \u00d7 10 6 platelets in a volume of 100 \u00b5l with saline. To activate Na + /H + exchange in the platelets by intracellular acidification, 500 \u00b5l propionate buffer (135 mM Na-propionate, 1 mM HCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 6.7, 22\u00b0C) are added to the PRP/NaCl solution. Swelling of the platelets results in a decrease of optical density which can be measured with an aggregometer, e. g. with a Turbitimer (Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany). The system is activated photometrically by the addition of the propionate buffer to the cuvette. The experiments are performed with and without the addition of the Na + /H + exchange inhibitor to be tested. The inhibitors are added in concentrations between 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22128 mol/l. 5-(N-ethyl-Nisopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) is used as standard.

The precipitate is separated by centrifugation and the supernatant submitted to chromatography on an aluminum oxide column. The column is first treated with Tris HCl buffer. From the supernatant, 900 ml is applied. After two washing periods, the cGMP is eluted in five fractions. These fractions are measured and the highest activities are pooled.

PDE3A mRNA is enriched in blood vessels, heart, megakaryocytes and oocytes, whereas PDE3B is highest in in adipocytes, hepatocytes, brain, renal collecting duct epithelium, and developing spermatocytes (Reinhardt et al. 1995) . PDE3 inhibitors have been extensively investigated and developed as non-glycoside, non-sympathomimetic, cardiotonic agents for the treatment of heart failure. Milrinone is the most studied and most extensively used PDE3 inhibitor and is used in the acute treatment of heart failure (Cruickshank 1993). Trequinsin (HL 725) inhibits PDE3 in a nanomolar range (Ruppert and Weithmann 1982) ; it also inhibits PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 in submicromolar concentrations (Stoclet et al. 1995) . Boswell-Smith et al. (2006) studied the pharmacology of two long-acting trequinsin-like phosphodiesterase 3/4 inhibitors, RPL554 and RPL565. Hambleton et al.

Subsequent studies by Seamon (1981) demonstrated that forskolin, unlike hormones, guanine nucleotides, fluoride or cholera toxin could stimulate cyclase activity in the absence of the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Since those reports, hundreds of papers have been published on the effects of forskolin in numerous mammalian organ and cell systems. Several comprehensive review articles have also been published (Seamon and Daly 1981 Daly , 1983 Daly 1984) . While forskolin has proven to be an invaluable research tool for investigations of adenylate cyclase systems (Salomon et al. 1974; Seamon et al. 1981 Seamon et al. , 1983 , reports on its effects on cardiovascular (Lindner et al. 1978) , pulmonary (Chang et al. 1984 ) and ocular physiology (Caprioli and Sears 1983; Caprioli 1985) suggest a therapeutic potential (Seamon 1984) as well.",

The cRNA for the wild-type \u03b1-subunit and its deletion mutant 278-273 is always coinjected with an equal amount of \u03b2 and \u03b3 -subunit cRNA (10 ng/oocyte). Then, 2-8 days after cRNA injection, the two-microelectrode voltage clamp method is used to record currents from Xenopus oocytes. Recordings are performed at 22\u00b0C using a Geneclamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, Calif., USA), and MacLab D/A converter and software for data acquisition and analysis (AD Instruments, Castle Hill, Australia). The ND 96 solution (control) contains (mM): NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl 2 1.8, MgCl 2 1, HEPES5, pH7.0. In some experiments, Na + is replaced by N-methyl-Dglucamine (NMDG) solution. The microelectrodes are filled with 3 M KCl solution and have resistances in the range 0.5-0.9 M . Chemicals (e. g., triamterene as standard) are added at concentrations between 0.2 and 100 \u00b5M. The amplitude of the induced currents varies considerably, depending on the day of channel expression and the batch of oocytes. The mutant channel induces considerably smaller currents than the wild-type channel. The total Na + current amplitude is determined at least once for each experimental day by superfusion with NMDG solution, or with 3 \u00b5M or 5 \u00b5M amiloride solution at the beginning and at the end of each set of experiments.",

(1995) studied the effects of a sodium, calcium, and potassium antagonistic agent on the sodium current by the whole cell voltage clamp technique (tip resistance = 5 M [Na] i and [Na] o 10 mmol/l at 20\u00b0C) in guinea pig isolated ventricular cells. Sunami and Hiraoka (1996) studied the mechanism of cardiac Na + channel block by a charged class I antiarrhythmic agent, in guinea pig ventricular myocytes using patch clamp techniques in the whole-cell, cellattached and inside-out configurations. Erd\u00f5 et al. (1996) compared the effects of Vinca derivatives on voltage-gated Na + channels in cultured cells from rat embryonic cerebral cortex. Effects on Na + currents were measured by applying voltage steps (20 ms duration) to -10 mV from a holding potential of -70 mV every 20 s. Steady-state inactivation curves were obtained by clamping the membrane at one of a series of 15-s prepulse potentials, followed 1 ms later by a 20-ms test pulse to -10 mV. Ragsdal et al. (1993) examined the actions of a Na + channel blocker in whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a cDNA encoding the rat brain type IIA Na + channel and from dissociated rat brain neurons. Taglialatela et al. (1996) studied cloned voltage-dependent Na + currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes upon injection of the cRNA encoding \u03b1-subunits from human and rat brain. investigated pharmacological targeting of long QT mutant sodium channels. Eller et al. (2000) measured the effects of a calcium antagonist on inward Na + currents (I Na ) in GH3cells with the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. I Na was recorded after depolarization from a holding potential of -80 mV to a test potential of +5 mV. Initial \"tonic\" block (resting statedependent block) was defined as peak I Na inhibition during the first pulse 2 min after drug application as compared with I Na in the absence of drug. \"Use-(frequency-) dependent\" block of I Na was measured during trains of 5-or 50-ms test pulses (3 Hz) applied from -80 mV to a test potential of +5 mV after a 2-min equilibrium period in the drug-containing solution. Use-dependent block was expressed as the percentage decrease of peak I Na during the last pulse of the train as compared with I Na during the first pulse. Khalifa et al. (1999) characterized the effects of an antidepressant agent on the fast inward current (I Na ) in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique in the presence of Ca 2+ and K + channel blockers. Haeseler et al. (1999) measured the effects of 4chloro-m-cresol, a preservative added to a wide variety of drugs, on heterologously expressed wild-type, Paramyotonia congenita (R1448H) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (M1360V) mutant \u03b1-subunits of human muscle sodium channels using whole-cell and inside-out voltage clamp experiments. Song et al. (2000) studied the effects of Nethyl-maleimide, an alkylating agent to protein sulfhydryl groups, on tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channels in rat dorsal root neurons using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Rats at the age of 2-6 days were anesthetized with isoflurane and the spinal cord was removed and cut longitudinally. Dorsal root ganglia were plucked from the area between the vertebrae of the spinal column, and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 2.5 mg/ml trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. After enzyme treatment, ganglia were rinsed with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. Single cells were mechanically dissociated by trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and plated on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Cells attached to the coverslips were transferred into a recording chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope. Ionic currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The solution in the pipette contained (in mM): CsCl 125, NaF 20, HEPES 5, EGTA 5. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH and the osmolarity was 279 mosmol/l on average. The external solution contained (in mM): NaCl 50, choline chloride 90, tetramethylammonium chloride 20, D-glucose 5, HEPES 5, MgCl 2 1, CaCl 2 1. Lanthanum (LaCl 3 , 10 \u00b5M) was used to block calcium channel current. The solution was adjusted to pH 7.4 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide and the osmolarity was 304 mosmol/l on average. An Ag-AgCl pellet/3 M KCl-agar bridge was used for the reference electrode. Membrane currents were recorded using an Axopatch-1D amplifier. Signals were digitized by a 12-bit analog-to-digital interface, filtered with a lowpass Bessel filter at 5 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz using pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments) on an IBMcompatible PC. Series resistance was compensated 60%-70%. Capacitative and leakage currents were subtracted by using a P + P/4 procedure (Bezanilla and Armstrong 1977) . The liquid junction potential between internal and external solutions was on average -1.7 mV. TTX (100 nM) was used to separate TTX-R sodium currents from TTX-S sodium currents. For the study of TTX-S sodium channels, cells that expressed only TTX-S sodium channels were used. TTX-S sodium channels were completely inactivated within 2 ms when currents were evoked by depolarizing steps to 0 mV, while TTX-R sodium channels persisted for more than 20 ms. The difference in kinetics was used to identify the type of sodium current. Abriel et al. (2000) described the molecular pharmacology of the sodium channel mutation DI790G linked to long QT syndrome. Makielski et al. (2003) showed that a ubiquitous splice variant and a common polymorphism affect heterologous expression of recombinant human SCN5AS heart sodium channels. Viswanathan et al. (2001) studied gating mechanisms for flecainide action in SNCN5A-linked arrhythmia syndromes.",

Several potent and selective blockers of the I Kr channel have been shown to prolong the effective refractory period, but have a reverse rate-dependent activity with both normal and elevated extracellular potassium concentrations (Colatsky et al. 1990 ). Inhibitors of the slow component I Ks were developed in order to circumvent the negative rate dependence of I Kr channel blockers in the effective refractory period (Busch et al. 1996; Suessbrich et al. 1996 Suessbrich et al. , 1997 Bosch et al. 1998) .

In these experiments, KCl in the pipette was replaced by CsCl and voltage pulses of 300 ms duration were applied from the potential of -40 mV to 0 mV. Possible effects of AVE0118 on the currents I K1 , I Ks , I Kr and I KATP were investigated in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. I K1 currents were recorded by a voltage step from -80 mV to -120 mV lasting for 200 ms. When I Ks and I Kr currents were recorded, 1 \u00b5M nisoldipine was added to the bath to block the L-type Ca 2+ current. I Ks was assessed by voltage pulse to +60 mV for 3 s, starting from -40 mV. I Kr was evaluated as the tail current evoked by a voltage pulse from -10 mV to -40 mV. I KATP was evoked by adding 1 \u00b5M rilmakalim (Krause et al. 1995) to the bath and by applying voltage ramps from -130 mV to +80 mV for 500 ms. The rilmakalim-activated current was recorded at the potential 0 mV. All patch clamp experiments were performed under continuous superfusion of the cells with solution heated to 36\u00b11\u00b0C.",

After cell attachment, the dish was mounted on the stage of an inverted phasecontrast microscope for Ca 2+ channel current recording. These cells expressed predominantly T channel currents. In experiments where L channels were specifically sought, the cells were grown and maintained at confluence for 3-4 weeks under the same culture conditions with the addition of 2% dimethylsulfoxide (Narahash et al. 1987) . Three to 5 days before use, the cells were replanted with the same medium. These cells expressed predominantly L channel currents. A small number of these cells also expressed T channel currents. Hence, cells were selected so that at a holding potential of -40 mV, the T channel component was very small and the inward current measured was conducted predominantly by L channels.",

At this temperature, the responsiveness of the cells to secretagogues, particularly to cAMP-dependent agonists, is improved. Increases in Cl \u2212 and K + conductances are the major electrical events during stimulation of Cl \u2212 secretion. Accordingly, bath-pipette ion gradients are chosen so that transmembrane Cl \u2212 and K + currents can be monitored independently at clamp voltages equal to the reversal potentials of these ions. The pipette solution is: 115 MM KCl, 25 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) glutamate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.19 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM Na 2 ATP, 0.05 mM Na 3 GPT, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2.

Chiral clofibric acid derivates were tested on the human ClC-1 channel, a skeletal muscle chloride channel, after heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes by means of two microelectrode voltage clamp recordings. The hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (termed I f , I h , or I q ) play a key role in the initiation of cardiac and neuronal pacemaker depolarizations. Unlike most voltage-gated channels, they are activated by hyperpolarizing voltage steps to potentials negative to -60 mV, near the resting potential of most cells. This property earned them the designation of I f for \"funny\" or I q for \"queer.\" The funny current, or pacemaker (I f ) current, was first described in cardiac pacemaker cells of the mammalian sino-atrial node as a current that slowly activates on hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic voltage range, and contributes to the generation of cardiac rhythmic activity and to its control by sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations (DiFrancesco et al. 1986; Accili et al. 1997 Accili et al. , 2002 Robinson and Siegelbaum 2003}; Baruscotti et al. 2005) . In sino-atrial cells, f-channels are modulated by cAMP independently of phosphorylation, through a mechanism involving direct interaction of cAMP with the intracellular side of the channels (DiFrancesco and Tortora 1991; Bois et al. 1996) . A significant advancement in the study of molecular properties of pacemaker channels was achieved when a new family of channels was cloned, the HCN (hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide gated) channels (Ishii et al. 1999; Kaupp and Seifert 2001; Biel et al. 2002; Macri et al. 2002) . The HCN family is related to the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and eag potassium channel family and belongs to the superfamily of voltage-gated cation channels. HCN channels are characterized by six membrane-spanning segments (S1-S6) including voltage-sensing (S4) and pore (between S5 and S6) regions. In the C-terminal region they contain a consensus sequence for binding of cyclic nucleotides. In the heart, neurotransmitterinduced control of cardiac rhythm is mediated by I f through its second-messenger cAMP, whose synthesis is stimulated and inhibited by \u03b2-adrenoceptor and muscarinic agonists, respectively.",

            "text": "Adrenomedullin is a 52-amino acid peptide originally discovered in human adrenal pheochromocytoma by monitoring the elevating activity of platelet cAMP (Kitamura et al. 1993 ). Molecular cloning of rat adrenomedullin was reported by Sakata et al. (1993) . The genomic structure of human adrenomedullin gene was reported by Ishimitsu et al. (1994) . Adrenomedullin and proadrenomedullin Nterminal 20 peptide (PAMP) which are both hypotensive and bronchodilating, are derived from preproadrenomedullin (Kanazawa et al. 1995; Iwasaki et al. 1996; Shimosawa and Fujita 1996; Hinson et al. 1998; Samson 1998; Autelitano and Tang 1999; Jimenez et al. 1999; Lopez et al. 1999; Tajima et al. 1999) . Adrenomedullin is found ubiquitously in tissues and organs, especially in cardiovascular tissues and in the kidney, lung, brain and endocrine glands (Wimalawansa 1996; Van Rossum et al. 1997; Eto et al. 1999; Jougasaki and Burnett 2000; Kitamuro et al. 2000) . The main biological effect is vasodilatation (Ishiyama et al. 1993; Nikitenko et al. 2002) . A hypotensive effect has been found in rats (Khan 1997), rabbits (Fukuhara et al. 1995) , and man (Lainchbury et al. 1997) . Adrenomedullin belongs to the calcitonin gene-related peptide/calcitonin peptide family as it shares approximately 25% homology with calcitonin gene-related peptide (Kitamura et al. 1993) . Several pharmacological studies are related to the vasodilating effect of adrenomedullin, e. g., in mouse aorta (Ashton et al. 2000) , in the mesenteric vascular bed (see A.8.2.5), (Santiago et al. 1995) , in the hind limb vascular bed (see A.8.2.1), (Santiago et al. 1994; , in the pulmonary vascular bed (see A.8.2.6), (DeWitt et al. 1994; Lippton et al. 1994; Heaton et al. 1995; Nossaman et al. 1995) , on cerebral blood flow in dogs (Baskaya et al. 1995) and in cats (Takao et al. (1999) , on renal hemodynamics in dogs (see A.8.2.3) Yukawa 1998) , or on vasodilation in perfused rat kidneys (Hayakawa et al. 1999) . Intravenous infusion of adrenomedullin exerted diuresis and natriuresis without major changes in blood pressure and produced beneficial hemodynamic and renal vasodilator effects in rats with compensated heart failure (Vari et al. 1996; Nagaya et al. 1999) . In isolated perfused, paced rat heart preparations, adrenomedullin showed a dose-dependent inotropic effect (Szokodi et al. 1998) . Pulmonary vasodilator responses and vasorelaxant effects in isolated pulmonary artery rings were found by Gumusel et al. (1998) . Adrenomedullin is a growth-promoting factor for cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (Iwasaki et al. 1998 ) and fibroblasts (Isumi et al. 1998) . Willenbrock et al. (1999) showed a beneficial effect of adrenomedullin on renal function in rats with aortocaval shunt.",

The atrial natriuretic peptide hormonal system consists of a 126-amino acids prohormone synthesized within myocytes of the heart and stored in storage granules within the heart before release into circulation (Kangawa and Matsuo 1984; Oikawa et al. 1984; Vesely 1992 ). This hormonal system contains several peptides from the 126-amino acid-prohormone with blood pressure lowering, natriuretic, diuretic and/or kaliuretic properties (Martin et al. 1990; Vesely et al. 1994 ). Thus, peptides consisting of amino acid 1 to 30 (LANP = long-acting natriuretic peptide), 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide) and 99 to 126 (ANF) each have blood pressure lowering, natriuretic, diuretic and/or kaliuretic properties both in humans and in animals. Human and rat atria predominantly secrete a peptide of 28 amino acid residues, ANF-(99-126), which represents the Cterminus of a precursor sequence of 126 amino acid residues. In addition, vessel dilator and LANP circulate as distinct entities after having been proteolytically cleaved from the rest of the amino terminus by proteases (Ackerman et al. 1997) . Plasma immunoreactive ANF-(99-126) concentration increases in normal rats after volume expansion, while infusion of the peptide lowers blood pressure in several animal models of hypertension.",

Anesthesia is maintained by injection of supplemental doses of pentobarbital sodium. After tracheotomy, catheters are placed into the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery for injection of samples or infusion of 10% mannitol in 0.9% saline and for blood pressure recording. Through a small suprapubic incision the bladder is cannulated for collection of urine, and the cannula is connected to a device for continuous measurement of urine conductivity, by which the electrolyte concentration is estimated. Urine flow rate is recorded using a drop counter, and urine samples are collected in a plastic tube. After completion of surgery, 0.6-0.8 ml of 10% mannitol in 0.9% saline is administered into the jugular vein and is continuously infused at a rate of 4.0 ml/h by a syringe pump. Following an equilibration of 45-60 min, the bioassay is started when the urine flow is increased to 50-75 \u00b5l/min. All test samples with a volume of 100 \u00b5l are directly injected into the jugular vein followed by a wash injection of \u223c30 \u00b5l of saline. Mean arterial blood pressure, urine conductivity, and urine flow rate are simultaneously recorded.",

Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% ambient CO 2 for 4-6 days.

The resulting colorimetric reaction was measured using a spectrophotometric plate reader (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala., USA) at 420 nM. For HTS, NIH-3T3 cells transiently transfected with the urotensin II receptor expression vector and plasmid were frozen and for the assay thawed, plated and exposed to drug. ",

The animals underwent general anesthesia while breathing spontaneously via a nose cone fitted carefully to minimize escape of anesthetic into the environment. Two percent isoflurane was adminis-tered with an oxygen flow rate of 1-2 l/min. Platinum needle ECG leads were inserted subcutaneously. Respiration was monitored by means of a pneumatic pillow sensor positioned against the abdomen. Mouse body temperature was maintained during scanning at 37\u00b0C by a flow of heated air thermostatically controlled by a rectal temperature probe. Magnetic resonance images were acquired on a 4.7 T Oxford magnet controlled by a Varian Inova console (Varian, Palo Alto, Calif., USA) using a transmit-receive, quadrature, volume coil with an inner diameter of 3.5 cm. Image acquisition was gated to respiration and to the ECG R wave (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, N.Y., USA). Coronal and sagittal scout images led to the acquisition of multiple contiguous 1-mm-thick, short axis slices orthogonal to the interventricular septum. Nine cine frames were taken at each slice level with the following sequence parameters: TE = 2.8 ms, NEX = 12, FOV = 3 \u00d7 3 cm, matrix = 128 \u00d7 128, flip angle = 60\u00b0. Cine frames were spaced 16 ms apart and acquired through slightly more than one cardiac cycle guaranteeing acquisition of systole and diastole. On the second day of scanning, mice received 300 \u00b5g/kg body weight of apelin as an intraperitoneal injection 1 h prior to scanning. A pilot study had previously identified 1 h as an appropriate time within which to identify apelin effects resulting from peritoneal absorption. Planimetry measurements of end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were derived offline from short axis views of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., USA). Ejection fraction was calculated as [LVEDA-LVESA]/LVEDA, where LVEDA is left ventricular end-diastolic area and LVESA is left ventricular end-systolic area.",

The transient receptor potential (TRP 1 ) ion channels are named after the role of the channels in Drosophila phototransduction (Montell 2001). The mammalian genes are encoded by at least 28 channel subunit genes (Clapham 2003; Moran et al. 2004; Clapham et al. 2005) . Six protein families comprise the mammalian TRP superfamily: the classic TRPs (TRPCs), the vanilloid receptor TRPs (TRPVs), the melastatin or long TRPs (TRPMs), the mucolipins (TRPMLs), the polycystins (TRPPs), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (ANKTM1, TRPA1).

Defects in TRP channels have been associated with changes in growth control and one TRP-related protein may be a tumor suppressor. Moreover, mutations in a member of the TRP superfamily are a common cause of polycystic kidney disease, while disruption of another is responsible for mucolipidosis, a neurodegenerative disease. TRP proteins are widely expressed in the nervous system, and, in non-excitable cells, TRP-related channels may be the primary mode of Ca 2+ entry. TRP proteins are cation channels; however, they vary significantly in their selectivity and mode of activation. Nevertheless, members of the TRP superfamily share significant sequence homology and predicted structural similarities.",

Three additional, more distantly related subfamilies have recently been defined: ANKTM1, a Ca 2+ -permeant, non-selective cation channel, is the only mammalian member of the TRPA branch of TRP proteins. It is activated by noxious cold temperature, pungent mustard oil compounds and may additionally serve as a mechanosensitive transduction channel in auditory hair cells as well as an ionotropic cannabinoid receptor. The three mucolipins, TRPML1, 2, and 3, appear to be ion channels in intracellular vesicles. Mutations in TRPML1 cause mucolipidosis type IV, a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, while genetic defects in TRPP2, a member of the TRPP subfamily, are frequently encountered in patients suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.",

TRPC1 was the first member of the mammalian TRP family purported to form an ion channel (Zitt et al. 1996) . Given the widespread expression of TRPC1 and its ability to coassemble with other TRPC subunits (Xu et al. 1997; Lintschinger et al. 2000; Str\u00fcbing et al. 2003) , TRPC1 might be a component of different heteromeric TRP complexes. The subgroup most closely related to TRPC1 comprises TRPC4 and TRPC5. TRPC4 and TRPC5 are PDZ motif-containing proteins that can form homomeric cation channels that are activated following stimulation of G q -coupled receptors (Okada et al. 1999 ) as well as receptor tyrosine kinases (Schaefer et al. 2000) . Xu and Beech (2001) found that TRPC1 is a membrane-spanning subunit of store-operated Ca 2+ channels in native vascular smooth muscle cells.",

The extrinsic nerves pass in a branch of the perineal nerve on either side to enter the deep surface of each muscle just before the formation of the ventral bar. After sacrifice, the abdomen of rats is opened in the mid-line, the pelvis split and the bladder and urethra removed. Care is required in clearing the lower part of the urethra to avoid damage to the ventral bar of muscle, the only region lying ventral to the colon. The colon is then cut through at the pelvic brim, the pelvic portion pulled forward and the delicate connective tissue behind cleared until the anococcygeus muscles come into view. The muscles are isolated, in some instances with the extrinsic nerve intact. The extrinsic nerves on either side run in the posterior scrotal branch of the perineal nerve and leave it to enter the deep surface of the anococcygeal muscles as the lie on the lateral surface of the colon. The ventral bar is cut through and each muscle mounted in a 100 ml bath containing Krebs solution at 36\u00b0C. The solution is gassed with 95% O 2 +5% CO 2 .

Four venous ring segments (3-4 mm long) were tested simultaneously by mounting them between force transducers and a rigid support for measurement of isometric force. Increasing doses of bradykinin were applied as bolus injections and the ensuing constrictor response was monitored with the aid of a PC-operated analysis System (Biosys, TSE, Bad Homburg, Germany). McBean et al. (1986 McBean et al. ( , 1988 used isolated segments of the arteria basilaris of pigs to detect compounds with antivasoconstrictive properties. Contraction is elicited by PGF 2\u03b1 , serotonin or norepinephrine. Specimens are obtained from adult pigs (strain: Deutsche Landrasse) within 30 min after slaughter from the local slaughter house and stored in nutritive solution. The vessels are trimmed to a length of 4 mm, and the segments are suspended between 2 L-shaped metal hooks in a bath containing 20 ml modified Krebs Henseleit solution (NaCl 148 mM, KCl 5.4 mM, CaCl 2 2.2 mM, NaHCO 3 12 mM, glucose 12 mM). The bath solution is maintained at 37\u00b0C and continuously gassed with carbogen to produce a resulting pH of 7.35-7.45. The preparation is incubated under a tension of 37.28 mN (optimal passive load producing the largest contractile response to 3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M PGF 2\u03b1 ). Following a 60 minute stabilization period, the vessels are sensitized with 30 mM KCl for 10 min. The vessels are washed for 1 minute, and allowed to recover for 30 min with additional 1 minute washes at 15 and 30 min. Thereafter, contractions of the vessels are induced by adding PGF 2\u03b1 at 3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M. The contractile response is allowed to plateau, then the test compound is administered at cumulative doses.",

The EC 50 is defined as the dose of drug producing half maximal response. Werner et al. (1991) studied the vascular selectivity of calcium antagonists using porcine isolated ventricular trabeculae and right coronary arteries. Merkel et al. (1992) used isolated porcine coronary artery rings precontracted with prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 to demonstrate the vasorelaxant activity of an A 1selective adenosine agonist. Miwa et al. (1993) compared the effect of a K +channel opener with cromakalim, nitroglycerin and nifedipine on endothelin-1-induced contraction of porcine coronary artery. Satoh et al. (1993) investigated in isolated porcine large coronary arteries whether or not the vasorelaxant actions of nicorandil and cromakalim would be selective using seven different vasoconstrictor agonists. Yokoyama et al. (1994) studied the vasodilating mechanisms of several pyridinecarboximidamide derivatives in isolated porcine coronary arteries. Makujina et al. (1995) described a procedure that facilitates the eversion of vascular smooth muscle. Vascular segments of porcine coronary artery, approximately 2 cm in length, were sutured to portions of polyethylene tubing inserted into the lumen of the vessel. After being secured and stabilized by the tubing, the vessel was everted while immersed in physiological buffer. Intracellular calcium concentrations (measured by fura-2AM fluorometry) and tension were registered simultaneously in everted rings denuded of endothelium. Izumi et al. (1996) tested a K + -channel opener and related compounds in isolated porcine coronary arteries contracted with 25 mM KCl. Fr\u00f8bert et al. (1996) described impedance planimetry as a new catheter-based technique to measure porcine coronary artery pharmacodynamics and compared the results with the commonly used wiremounted isometric tension technique after in vitro application of nifedipine in various concentrations. A four-electrode impedance measuring system was located inside a 12-mm long balloon which was introduced into 3-4 cm long segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery obtained from 70-90-kg Danish Landrace-Yorkshire pigs. Hamel et al. (1993) dissected segments (3-4 mm long) of temporal ramifications of the middle cerebral artery from bovine brains and mounted them between two L-shaped metal prongs in a tissue bath containing Krebs-Ringer solution at 37\u00b0C. Changes in muscle tension were measured by a force displacement transducer and recorded on a polygraph. Several 5-HT receptor agonists were tested for their ability to induce vasoconstriction and their potencies were compared to that of 5-HT. The authors concluded that bovine pial arteries appear to be the best available model for the human cerebrovascular 5-HT 1D receptor.",

Corporal strips are placed in organ baths containing 10 ml Tyrode's buffer (NaCl 124.9 mmol/l, KCl 12.5 mmol/l, MgCl 2 \u00b76H 2 O 0.5 mmol/l, NaH 2 PO 4 H 2 O 0.4 mmol/l, CaCl 2 1.8 mmol/l and glucose 5.5.mmol/l) at 37\u00b0C. Each tissue is equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 at pH 7.4. One end of each strip is connected to a force displacement transducer, and changes in muscle tension are measured and recorded with a polygraph. After zeroing and balancing transducers and strip chart, 2.0 g of tension is placed on each strip, and the strips are allowed to equilibrate for 30 min.",

Prior to the ligation of the subclavian arteries, blood flow from rat A supplied its own brain and both brain hemispheres but not the brain stem of rat B.

This rat cross-circulation preparation can be used to separate the central and peripheral cardiovascular actions of drugs. Zavisca et al. (1994) studied the hypertensive responses to defined electrical and mechanical stimuli in anesthetized rats. Rats were given etomidate, 3.8 mg/kg/h intravenously following carotid artery and jugular vein cannulation. At 15 min after beginning the infusion, 4 types of noxious stimuli were administered sequentially at 1-min intervals: Type 1: Square electrical waves 125 cps, 1.6 ms, 2-s duration, varying current from 0.4 to 12 mA; Type 2: A single 10-mA electrical stimulus, 5-s train duration; Type 3: Tail clamping; Type 4: Skin incision. After each stimulus, maximum change in systolic blood pressure was measured. Graded electrical stimulation allowed the best quantitative evaluation of the hypertensive response to noxious stimuli. Hyman et al. (1998) described a novel catheterization technique for the in vivo measurements of pulmonary vascular responses in rats. Male Charles River rats weighing 26-340 g were anesthetized and strapped in supine position to a fluoroscopic table. They breathed air enriched with oxygen through an endotracheal tube inserted by tracheostomy. Catheters were inserted into the femoral blood vessels. The venous catheters were passed to the right atrium under fluoroscopy. A F-1 thermistor catheter was passed from the left carotid artery into the ascending aorta under fluoroscopy, and a PE-50, 150-mm plastic catheter with a specially constructed curved tip was passed fluoroscopically from the left jugular vein into the main pulmonary artery. A plastic radiopaque 22-gauge catheter 100 mm in length with a curved tip was passed with a 0.025 mm soft-tip coronary guiding catheter from the right jugular vein through the right atrium to the inferior vena cava. The coronary softtip guide was then withdrawn. A specially curved 102.5-mm transseptal needle, 0.4 mm in diameter, was then passed though the catheter. Both the needle and catheter were withdrawn into the superior portion of the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance so that the needle and catheter both rotated freely. With the rat in a slight left anterior oblique position, the catheter and needle were carefully rotated anteriorly to the intraatrial septum. With gentle pressure, the catheter and needle can be felt and seen fluoroscopically to pass through the atrial septum. As the needle was withdrawn, the curve of the catheter permitted passage of the tip into the vein draining either the left or right lower lobe. The catheter was carefully positioned near the pulmonary venoatrial junction and fixed in place. Mean pressures in the femoral artery, pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein at the venoatrial junction were measured with pressure transducers and recorded on a polygraph. Cardiac output was obtained in triplicate by delivering 0.1 ml normal saline at room temperature into the femoral venous catheter at the right venoatrial junction and determining thermodilution cardiac output with the thermistor catheter in the ascending aorta. Hayes (1982) described a technique for determining contractility, intraventricular pressure, and heart rate in the anesthetized guinea pig by inserting a needle, attached to a pressure transducer, through the chest wall into the left ventricle. Williams et al. (1995) used castrated male ferrets anesthetized by intramuscular injection of a mixture of 55 mg/kg ketamine and 4 mg/kg xylazine to measure the effects of a nonpeptidyl endothelin antagonist on endothelin-induced pressor responses.

Thirty min after pithing, a 0.3 ml blood sample is withdrawn from the carotid cannula and immediately analyzed for pO 2 , pCO 2 , pH, and derived bicarbonate concentration using an automatic blood gas analyzer.

The steel rod is insulated with an adhesive throughout its length except for a 5 cm section which provides sufficient a stimulation area of the lower thoracolumbar nerves. For stimulating nerves fibers supplying exclusively the heart, a pithing rod is used which is insulated throughout its length except for a 0.5 cm section 7 cm proximal to the tip. The spinal cord is stimulated electrically using the pithing rod as the cathode and a hypodermic needle which is inserted under the skin near the right hind-limb, as the anode. Varying the intensity and/or the duration of the stimulation, dose-response curves can be registered which are altered after treatment with drugs. Curtis et al. (1986) described an improved pithed rat method by mounting the preparation vertically with the head pointing downward resulting in considerably higher blood pressure and heart rate. MacLean and Hiley (1988) studied the effect of artificial respiratory volume on the cardiovascular responses to an \u03b1 1 -and \u03b1 2 -adrenoceptor agonist in the air-ventilated pithed rat using microsphere technique and analysis of arterial blood gases and pH. Trolin (1975) used decerebrated rats to study the clonidine-induced circulatory changes. Balt et al.

The external jugular vein is followed and the division into the maxillary vein, the facial and the linguofacial vein identified. The largest vein is chosen and mobilized for a distance of about 5 mm. Small artery forceps are used to clamp the vessel. The vein is then ligated rostral to the clamp with 6-0 silk, and a second ligature is put loosely around the vessel, but not tightened.

The vessel is dilated by means of a sharp pointed jeweler's forceps, the cannula slit between the legs of the forceps and gently pushed into the vessel until the tip is at the level of the right atrium. Then the forceps is removed, the caudal ligature gently tied, and the rostral ligature used to anchor the cannula to the vessel. The cannula is tunneled to emerge at the top of the head.

After opening the abdominal wall, the intestines are lifted out and laid next to the animal on the right side (as viewed by the surgeon) on gauze moistened with warm saline solution. This provides an excellent view to the vena cava. At its confluence with the vena cava, the right renal vein is stripped of its adipose tissue and the peritoneum is opened. Using small anatomical forceps the peritoneum is detached from the vena cava by making small spreading movements with the forceps just beneath the peritoneum. Subsequently, the vena cava and the renal vein are mobilized for approximately 1.5 cm, to allow for clamping of the vessel. A four or five fine-stitch purse-string is placed in the vessel at the confluence of the vena cava and the right renal vein. Using a Barraquer needle holder and a cottonwool stick, the 7-0 silk suture, armed with a BV-1 needle, is guided through the vessel. After each stitch, any bleeding has to be immediately arrested by applying light pressure using a cotton-wool stick. Having completed the suture a single knot is made with the drawstrings. Three microvascular clips are then placed on the vena cava and the renal vein; first the proximal clip on the vena cava, followed by the clip on the renal vein and finally the distal vena cava clip. A small aperture is cut immediately inside the purse-string suture using iridectomy scissors and jeweler's forceps. The cannula, which is filled with a heparinized saline solution, is pushed into the opening as far as possible. Subse-quently, the purse-string suture is pulled taut and the clip of the renal vein removed, while pushing the cannula further. The proximal clip on the vena cava is now removed as quickly as possible. The patency of the cannula is checked and the drawstrings of the pursestring suture are used to anchor the cannula. The cannula is laid kink-free in the abdominal cavity and sutured to the internal abdominal cavity near the xiphoid cartilage.

After opening the abdominal wall, the intestines are placed left to the animal on gauze moistened with warm saline solution. Proximally and distally to the animal's right renal vein, the vena cava is then stripped of its adipose and connective tissue, and the retroperitoneal cavity is opened. Using anatomical forceps the peritoneum is dissected from the vena cava by making small spreading movements with the forceps just above the vena cava. The portal vein is pulled slightly to the left using straight anatomical forceps and freed from the hepatic artery and the gastroduodenal artery with curved anatomical forceps. Rostral to the celiac artery, the abdominal artery which is covered with peritoneum is freed from its lateral muscle bed over a length of approximately 5 mm providing enough space for placing a small bulldog clamp at a later stage of the operation. Without occlusion a six fine-stitch purse-string is placed in the wall of the vena cava close to its confluence with the right renal vein. Using a Barraquer needle holder and a cotton wool stick, the 7-0 silk suture armed with a BV-1 needle is guided through the vessel. After each stitch, bleeding has to be arrested immediately, by applying light pressure on the area, again using the cotton wool stick. After the suture has been completed, a single knot is made with the drawstrings. The drawstrings should come together at the rostral part of the purse-string. A bulldog clamp, modified to resemble a Satinsky vascular clamp, is then placed on the vena cava. Before clamping the abdominal aorta rostral to the celiac artery with a small bulldog clamp, a ligature (7-0 silk) is placed around the portal vein as close as possible to the hilus of the liver. Subsequently, the clamp is placed on the aorta and the ligature tightened. A Heifetz clip is then placed transversely onto the portal vein at its confluence with the gastroduodenal vein. The portal vein is cut just distally from the ligature. A prepared button is slipped over the lefthand straight small anatomical forceps, while the righthand forceps are used to pass the portal vein to the left-hand anatomical forceps. The vein is then grasped and pulled through the button. Subsequently, the button is pushed as close as possible to the Heifetz clip, and clamped to the clip using a Pilling bulldog clamp.",

After the mice are placed on a thermally controlled surgical table with body temperature continually monitored via a rectal probe, a tracheotomy is performed with a short length (< 1 cm) of PE-90 tubing. The right femoral artery is then cannulated with polyethylene tubing which is pulled over a flame to a small diameter (\u223c0.4 mm OD). The catheter is advanced \u223c1 cm, near the level of the aorta, and connected directly to a low-compli-ance COBE CDXIII fixed-dome pressure transducer for the measurement of arterial blood pressure. The right femoral vein is then cannulated with the same type of small-diameter tubing and connected to a microinjection pump for the infusion of experimental drugs. To assess myocardial performance, the right carotid artery is cannulated with a 2F Millar MIKRO-TIP transducer (Model SPR-407, Millar Instruments, Houston TX). This high-fidelity transducer, which has a tip diameter of \u223c0.67 mm, has a reported frequency response that is flat up to 10,000 Hz and therefore can be used to accurately monitor the high frequency of the mouse ventricular pulse pressure. During continual monitoring of the blood pressure wave to ascertain the anatomic position of the catheter, the tip of the transducer is carefully advanced through the ascending aorta and into the left ventricle. When the stable waveform of the ventricular pressure profile is achieved, the transducer is anchored in place with 7-0 silk sutures. After completion of the surgery, all wounds are closed with cyanoacrylate to minimize evaporative loss of fluid, and the animals are allowed to stabilize for 30-45 min.",

A coronary catheter was introduced through the right femoral artery and advanced under fluoroscopy to the left coronary ostium, guided by injection of small amounts of contrast medium. After reaching baseline values, acute left ventricular failure was induced by subsequent intra-coronary injections of plastic microspheres (52.9 \u00b12.48 \u00b5m non-radioactive tracer microspheres). The microspheres were suspended in saline with a drop of Tween 80 and sonified before use, 1 mg microspheres/1 ml saline corresponding to approximately 12,000 microspheres. (13-16 injections of microspheres or 3.4-5.0 mg/kg). Microspheres were injected every 5 min for 70-90 min. Each microsphere injection effected an immediate and stepwise increase in LVEDP. With this procedure, LVEDP can be increased to a desired level in a very controlled manner. In the 30 min following embolization, LVEDP continued to increase by approximately 5 mm Hg. Animal with arrhythmias had to be excluded from the study. Thirty min after the end of embolization, when hemodynamic parameters had stabilized, drug administrations were started. Valdes-Cruz et al.

Carbonized microspheres (15 \u00b1 5 \u00b5 diameter) labelled with 85 Sr are drawn into a glass injection chamber and suspended in 0.3 ml 6% dextran so that each chamber contains 60000 to 80,000 microspheres.

The microspheres are injected into the left ventricle in a total volume of 0.8 ml 6% dextran over 20 s. Simultaneously, arterial blood from the femoral artery is withdrawn at 0.8 ml/min for 90 s with a syringe withdrawal pump.",

A continuous suture of fine silk is started at the place where the vessel emerges from the muscle borders.

Arterial pressure is transmitted to the sensor via a 0.7-mm diameter, fluidfilled catheter; 2. the receiver which detects the signal from the implanted transmitter and converts it to a form readable by computer; 3. the pressure reference module, which measures atmospheric pressure to allow for the telemetered absolute pressure to be converted to a gauge pressure; 4. the data acquisition software, which accepts data from the reference module and the receivers, filters corrupt samples from the incoming data stream, converts the telemetered pressure to millimeters of mercury, subtracts atmospheric pressure from the telemetered pressure, and stores the data for retrieval, plotting, and analysis. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the telemetry transmitter is implanted into rats. The descending aorta is exposed between the renal arteries. A vascular clamp is made by putting two surgical threads on the proximal and distal part of the artery. The catheter tip is inserted through an incision in the vessel. A drop of cyanoacrylate glue is applied to the dried entry point. The transmitter is sutured to the abdominal musculature.",

Fleckenstein et al. (1950) recommended this as a suitable animal model of shock. The original observation was a triphasic blood pressure response in cats or dogs characterized by a short lasting fall in blood pressure accompanied by bradycardia, followed by a short lasting increase and than a long-lasting decrease of blood pressure after intravenous injection of veratridin or other veratrum alkaloids. Kalkman et al. (1984) showed that three distinct subtypes of serotonergic receptors mediate the triphasic blood pressure response to serotonin observed in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex.",

When experimental animals are injected with endotoxin and galactosamine, shock and death occur in all untreated animals 5-7 h after injection. The endotoxin induced shock is marked by pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm and renal failure. Bacterial liposaccharides (endotoxins) play an important role in the pathogenicity of Gram-negative infections. The reactivity of animals to endotoxin may be enhanced by simultaneous administration of galactosamine. Galactosamine is a specific hepatotoxic agent that leads to early metabolic alterations and consequent cellular liver damage. The following procedure is used to detect compounds that prevent the occurrence of endotoxin-induced shocks.",

Then, the rubber tubes are removed, and the rats are returned to their cages. Within a few min, the reperfused hind limbs, which have been pale blue, turn pink. The animals are then allowed free access to food and water. Blood is withdrawn at different intervals during the tourniquet and afterwards for measurement of hematocrit, transaminases, urea nitrogen and total protein. Time to death is registered.",

The rat's head rested on the base platform of a binocular Olympus microscope positioned so that the pupil diameter of the right eye could be measured by means of a micrometer inserted into one eyepiece of the microscope. A constant light intensity was maintained throughout the experiment. Rats were first injected with saline 25 min after anesthesia induction. The pupil diameter was measured 1 min after injection. Five min after measurement, mydriasis was induced by clonidine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and the diameter was measured 1 min after injection. This was followed by the test compound, injected at 6 min intervals at increasing doses. The pupil was measured at 1 min after each injection. The dose inhibiting 50% of the clonidine-induced mydriasis (ID 50 ) was determined per rat from the cumulative dose-response curve. Savontaus et al.

Compared to tests in isolated organs, in vivo activity can be determined after intraperitoneal or intraduodenal administration. H\u00e4rtfelder et al. (1958) studied the influence of various agents on the contractions of electrically stimulated isolated uteri of rabbits and guinea pigs. Nathason (1985) evaluated the activity of betablockers to inhibit the cardio-acceleratory effect of systemically administered isoproterenol in unanesthetized, restrained albino rabbits together with the effect on membrane bound adenylate cyclase in homogenized ciliary process villi in order to find compounds selectively lowering intraocular pressure. Gillespie JS, Muir TC (1967) Intravenous administration of isoprenaline (isoproterenol) stimulates \u03b2 1 -receptors of the heart which can be detected as an increase in contractility (dp/dt max). Intraarterial injection of isoprenaline stimulates \u03b2 2receptors of peripheral blood vessels leading to an increased peripheral blood flow. Therefore, a \u03b2 1 -or \u03b2 2blocking activity of a compound is revealed by the inhibition of the effects of isoprenaline. The following tests are used to evaluate \u03b2-blocking activity of drugs. A \u03b2-blocker screening is done in anesthetized dogs (a); in addition, the test allows a differentiation between \u03b2 1 -and \u03b2 2 -receptor activity and the determination of ED 50 values (b).",

Brooks et al. (1995) compared the cardiovascular and renal effects of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and captopril in rats with chronic renal failure induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. Under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia the right kidney was removed and approximately two thirds of the left kidney was infarcted by ligating two or three branches of the left renal artery. Kim et al. (1997) studied the effects of an angiotensin AT 1 receptor antagonist on volume overload-induced cardiac gene expression in rats. An abdominal aortacaval shunt was prepared in 9-weeks old male Wistar rats under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. The vena cava and the abdominal aorta were exposed by opening the abdominal cavity via a midline incision. The aorta was punctured at the union of the segment two thirds caudal to the renal artery and one third cephalic to the aortic bifurcation with a 18-gauge disposable needle. The needle was advanced into the aorta, perforating its adjacent wall and penetrating the vena cava. After the aorta was clamped, the needle was withdrawn, and a drop of cyanoacrylate glue was used to seal the aortic puncture point. The patency of the shunt was verified visually by swelling of the vena cava and mixing of arterial and venous blood. The rats were treated either with vehicle or the angiotensin antagonist. Four days after the preparation of the AC shunt, 24 h-urine volume, electrolytes and aldosterone were measured. Six days after the AC shunt blood was collected by puncture of a tail vein and plasma renin activity and aldosterone were measured. Seven days after AC shunt, hemodynamic studies were performed in pentobarbital anesthesia. Afterwards, the heart was rapidly excised, left and right atria and ventricles were separated and frozen in liquid nitrogen for the extraction and measurement of cardiac tissue RNA. Shibasaki et al. (1997) tested the effect on the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system in conscious rats after cannulation of the abdominal aorta under anesthesia 3-4 days before the experiment. After oral dosing of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist blood samples were withdrawn and plasma renin and aldosterone determined by radioimmunoassay.",

One week before the experiment, the animals were anesthetized, and a 3F high fidelity pressure tip transducer (Millar Instruments, Inc.) was inserted into the abdominal aorta through the right femoral artery. Then the catheter was tunneled subcutaneously to the back of the monkey in the interscapular region. The proximal part of the catheter was connected to a transmitter located in a jacket worn by the monkey. The blood pressure was transmitted continu-ously to a receiver, which transformed the signal to an analogue value of blood pressure. reported on the effects of renin inhibitors in anesthetized rhesus monkeys weighing between 5 and 13 kg. The animals are sodium-depleted by administration of 10 mg/kg/day furosemide-Na for 6 consecutive days. At day 7, 10 mg/kg furosemide is given i.v. 30 min before the start of the experiment. Anesthesia is induced with 20 mg/kg ketaminehydrochloride i.m. and continued with 40 mg/kg pentobarbitone-Na, slow i.v. drip.

Cardiac output is determined using the thermodilution method. Thermodilution is integrated and converted to cardiac output readings by commercially available equipment (HMV 7905, Hoyer, Bremen). To determine cardiac output, 2 ml chilled 0-5\u00b0C isotonic glucose solution (5%) is injected rapidly into the right ventricle by a catheter via the right jugular vein.

Penile erections were elicited by submaximal pelvic nerve stimulation every 5 min for 30 min. Response was assessed by continuously recording intracavernosal pressure and systemic arterial pressure. Min et al. (2000) tested the augmentation of pelvicnerve-mediated sexual arousal in anesthetized female rabbits by sildenafil. The following parameters were measured before, during and after pelvic nerve stimulation at 4, 16, and 32 Hz: (1) hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation in female genital (vaginal, labial, clitoral) tissues by laser oximetry; (2) clitoral blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry; (3) vaginal luminal pressure by a balloon catheter pressure transducer; (4) vaginal lubrication by tampon. Carter et al. (1998) tested the effect of the selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil on erectile dysfunction in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Increases in intracavernosal pressure in the corpus cavernosum and penile blood flow were induced by pelvic nerve stimulation over a frequency range of 1-16 Hz. The effects of increasing doses of sildenafil on electricstimulated intracavernosal pressure, penile blood flow, blood pressure, and heart rate were evaluated. ",

Left ventricular pressure and dp/dt are recorded via the left common carotid artery (post-deafferentiation) using a Millar microtip pressure transducer. P max is recorded by speeding up the chart paper. Cardiac output is determined by introducing a Swan-Ganz catheter into the right heart and pulmonary artery via a jugular vein. Five ml of cold 5% dextrose is injected into the right atrium and an Edwards Cardiac output computer is used to calculate the cardiac output from the temperature change in the pulmonary artery. All recordings are made with a polygraph. Both of the carotid arteries are cleared up to the bifurcation of the internal and external carotid arteries. The carotid sinus nerves are isolated, ligated and sectioned and a bilateral vagotomy is performed to produce neurogenic hypertension (mean arterial pressure more than 150 mm Hg). The dog is allowed to equilibrate for approximately 30 min and a bolus of the test compound is administered by intravenous injection. Heart rate, arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure, Pmax and dp/dt are monitored for 90 min. A minimum of 3 dogs are used for each compound.",

Group 1 (control) had free access to tap water and food. Groups 2-4 were treated with 0.02% L-NAME water solution for 6 weeks in a daily dose of 25 mg/kg. Groups 3 and 4 received the angiotensin receptor antagonists fonsartan (10 mg/kg) or lorsatan (30 mg/kg) for 6 weeks daily per stomach tube. Groups 5 and 6 received fonsartan and lorasatan alone. At the end of the study, 24-h urine samples were collected and retrobulbar blood samples were taken in short inhalation anesthesia. Plasma values of creatine, PRA and electrolytes were determined. For clearance evaluation rats were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg thiopentone i.p. In order to determine glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, clearances of inulin and para-aminohippurate were performed. After the clearance experiments, the rats were sacrificed and hearts and kidneys removed. Hearts were perfused in the isolated working heart preparation via the aorta with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing solvents or drugs. After a preischemic period of 20 min, acute regional myocardial ischemia was produced by clamping the left coronary artery close to its origin for 15 min (ischemic period). Thereafter, the clip was removed and changes during reperfusion were monitored (reperfusion period). The following cardio-dynamic and cardio-metabolic parameters were measured: incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation, left ventricular pressure, contractility (dP/dt max), heart rate and coronary flow; in the coronary effluent lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and lactate; in the myocardial tissue lactate, glycogen, ATP and creatine phosphate. Left ventricular pressure was measured with a Statham pressure transducer (P 23 DB) which on differentiation yielded LV dP/dt max and heart rate. Coronary flow was determined by electromagnetic flow probes in the aortic cannula. For the determination of lactate release, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) activities in the perfusate samples were taken from the coronary effluent and analyzed spectrophotometrically.",

The portal vein was isolated and stenosis created by a single ligature of 3-0 silk placed around the portal vein and a 20-gauge blunt-tipped needle after devascularization of the left renal vein. This devascularization is indispensable in preventing the development of excess collateral vessels, which inhibit the formation of esophageal varices and the portal hypertensive state. The needle was then removed from the ligature. In addition, 3-0 silk was also placed at the area of partial ligation (loose ligation), and both ends were then drawn out through the abdominal wall. Five days after the operation, the ends of the silk that had been placed in the flank were simultaneously pulled to induce complete portal vein ligation. Two weeks later, this portal hypertension model was completed. Portal venous pressure, blood flow volume in the intra-abdominal viscera, plasma NO and plasma endothelin-1 were measured.",

The chest is opened and flooded with ice-cold saline and the heart arrested. Cannulae are inserted into the aorta and the superior (for measurement of central venous pressure) and inferior venae cavae. The heart-lung preparation is perfused with a solution containing rat blood cells from another rat and Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, with hematocrit and pH of 25% and 7.4, respectively. Concentration of the buffer constituents (mM): NaCl 127, KCl 5.1, CaCl 2 2.2, KH 2 PO 4 1.3, MgSO 4 2.6, NaHCO 3 15, glucose 5.5 and heparin. The perfusate pumped from the aorta passes through a pneumatic resistance and is collected in a reservoir maintained at 37\u00b0C and then returned to the inferior vena cava. In this model, no other organs except the heart and lung are perfused. Cardiac output is determined by the inflow as long as the heart does not fail. Mean arterial pressure is regulated by the pneumatic resistance. Heart rate is recorded by a bioelectric amplifier and cardiac output is measured with an electromagnetic blood flow meter. Arterial pressure and right atrial pressure are measured with transducers and amplifiers. The heart is perfused initially with cardiac output of 30 ml/min and mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg. Test drugs are administered into the perfusate 5 min after start of the experiment.",

Since then, the method has been improved from the technical site and is nowadays used for studies with guinea-pig, rabbit or rat hearts. In principle, the heart is perfused in retrograde direction from the aorta either at constant pressure or at constant flow with oxygenated saline solutions. Retrograde perfusion closes the aortic valves, just as in the in situ heart during diastole. The perfusate is displaced through the coronary arteries flowing off the coronary sinus and the opened right atrium. In this original set-up the ventricles do not fill with perfusate and therefore do not perform pressure-volume work. Parameters usually measured are: contractile force, coronary flow and cardiac rhythm.",

For studies of biochemical parameters in tissue and perfusate, removal of the heart dur-ing barbiturate anesthesia and artificial respiration is recommended. The heart is removed as quickly as possible and placed in a dish containing Ringer's solution at 37\u00b0C. Associated pericardial and lung tissue are removed. The aorta is located and cut just below the point of its division. A glass or plastic cannula is introduced into the aorta, tied with two threads and perfusion is started with oxygenated Ringer's solution or Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The heart is transferred to a double walled plexiglass perfusion apparatus which is kept at 37\u00b0C by the water from a thermostat. Oxygenated Ringer's solution is perfused at a constant pressure of 40 mm Hg and at a temperature of 37\u00b0C from a reservoir. A small steel hook with a string is attached to the apex of the heart. Contractile force is measured isometrically by a force transducer with a preload of 2.5 g and recorded on a polygraph. Coronary flow is measured by a drop counter. Alternatively, flow measurements can be performed using a mechanic-electronic flow meter consisting of a vertical pipe and a magnetic valve (Hugo Sachs Electronic KG, Germany). Heart rate is measured through a chronometer coupled to the polygraph. Drugs are injected into the perfusion medium just above the aortic cannula.",

During the systole of the heart, the left ventricle repumps the perfusate through the aorta into the reservoir. The perfusate flowing through the coronary arteries and dripping off from the outside of the heart is collected in a vessel below the heart and recirculated into the reservoir with a roller pump. Flynn et al. (1978) underlined the difference of this working heart preparation to the original LAN-GENDORFF method and reported the effects of histamine and noradrenaline on peak left ventricular systolic pressure, contractility, sinus rate, coronary flow, aortic flow, total cardiac output, and external pressurevolume work. Therefore, this method is reported separately. Ishiu et al. (1996) measured simultaneously Ca 2+dependent indo-1 fluorescence and left ventricular pressure on a beat-to-beat basis in Langendorff guinea pig hearts and investigated the changes in Ca +2 transient and left ventricular function during positive inotropic stimulation and myocardial ischemia.",

(1996) . Gottlieb and Magnus (1904) introduced the so called \"balloon method\". A small balloon fixed to the tip of a catheter is filled with water and inserted into the left ventricle via one of the pulmonary veins, the left atrium and the mitral valve. The balloon size has to fit the volume of the left ventricle and therefore its size depends on the animal species and body weight. The catheter can be fixed by tying the pulmonary vein stems. Via a three-way valve, the balloon can be extended to a given preload. The beating heart now exerts a rhythmic force to the balloon and thus to the membrane of a pressure transducer. The advantages of this method are that force development and preload can be stated reproducibly in pressure units [mm Hg], left ventricular contraction curves can be used for further calculations, and continuous heart rate recordings can be carried out without any problems when using a rate meter. Sakai et al. (1983) reported a similar method adapted to mice. Bardenheuer and Schrader (1983) described a method whereby the balloon is inserted into the left ventricle as described above. However, isovolumetric pressure in the left ventricle is not measured. Instead, the fluid in the balloon is pumped through the cannula into a closed extra corporal circulation. The fluid is forced into one direction by 2 recoil valves. The balloon is made of silicone material using a Teflon form (Linz et al. 1986 ). The dimensions of the form are derived from casts of the left ventricle of K + -arrested heart by injection of dental cement (Palavit 55, Kulzer and Co, GmbH, Germany). During each heart beat the fluid volume expelled from the balloon corresponding to the stroke volume of the heart, can be recorded by means of a flow meter probe and an integrator connected in series. Preload and afterload can be adjusted independently from each other. The perfusate flow (retrograde into the aorta and through the coronary arteries) is recorded separately.",

Avkiran and Curtis (1991) constructed a dual lumen aortic cannula which permits independent perfusion of left and right coronary beds in isolated rat hearts without necessitating the cannulation of individual arteries. Igic (1996) described a modification of the isolated perfused working rat heart. A special double cannula was designed consisting of an outer cannula that is inserted into the aorta and an inner cannula that is advanced into the left ventricle. The perfusion fluid flows through the inner cannula into the left ventricle, and is ejected from there into the aorta. If the outer cannula system is closed, the fluid perfuses the coronary vessels and drips off outside the heart. When the outer cannula is open and certain pressure resistance is applied, a fraction of the ejected fluid perfuses coronary vessels and the rest is expelled. Because the inner cannula can be easily retracted into the outer cannula, which is placed in the aorta, the preparation provides an opportunity to use the same heart as a \"working\" or \"non-working\" model for investigating functions of the heart.",

D\u00f6ring and Dehnert (1988) described continuous simultaneous ultrasonic recording of two cardiac diameters in an isolated perfused guinea-pig heart. For the measurement of the left ventricular transversal diameter the ultrasonic transmitter was positioned at the epicardium at the largest cardiac diameter.

Cardiac glycosides shorten the refractory period, decrease the conduction velocity and increase heterotopic stimulus generation. Aconitine increases markedly heterotopic stimulus generation. Both compounds together induce invariably ventricular fibrillation. Anti-arrhythmic com-pounds can be tested in this way. Fibrillation is inhibited, at least partially, by 20 \u00b5g prenylamine, 10-20 \u00b5g quinidine or 20 \u00b5g ajmaline. Takeo et al. (1992) described protective effects of anti-arrhythmic agents on oxygen-deficiency-induced contractile dysfunction of isolated perfused hearts. Hypoxia in isolated rabbit hearts was induced by perfusing the heart for 20 min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer saturated with a gas mixture of 95% N 2 and 5% CO 2 containing 11 mM mannitol. After hypoxic perfusion, the heart was reoxygenated for 45 min with oxygenated buffer containing glucose. Dhein et al.

From the activation times of the surrounding electrodes, the direction and velocity of activation for each electrode were calculated, thereby allowing construction of an epicardial vector field.

Immediately afterwards, the heart is stimulated with a current of 40 Hz and 5 mA for 2 min. This procedure is repeated every 10 min. Standard conditions are achieved when the fibrillation continues without further electrical stimulation. Hearts treated in this way serve as controls. Other hearts stimulated in the same way are treated with continuous infusion of the test drug or the standard via the perfusion medium. Differences in the incidence of fibrillations are calculated using the \u03c7 2 test. Balderston et al.

A cannula is introduced into the aorta from where the coronary vessels are perfused with the non-recirculated perfusion medium according to the Langendorff technique. In the left ventricle a balloon closely fitting the ventricular cavity is placed and connected to an artificial systemic circulation. The fluid in the balloon is pumped through a cannula into the closed extra corporal circulation being forced into one direction by 2 recoil valves. The balloon is made of silicone material using a Teflon form (Linz et al. 1986 ). The dimensions of the form are derived from casts of the left ventricle of K + -arrested heart by injection of dental cement (Palavit 55, Kulzer and Co, GmbH, Germany). During each heart beat the fluid volume pressed from the balloon, corresponding to the stroke volume of the heart, can be recorded by means of a flow meter probe and an integrator connected in series.

Left ventricular pressure, LV dP/dt max, and coronary flow are reduced after coronary constriction by angiotensin II, whereas enzyme activities in the effluent are increased and the myocardial content of glycogen, ATP and creatine phosphate are decreased. Cardiac protective drugs have the opposite effects. The values of each parameter are statistically compared with controls. Vogel and Lucchesi (1980) described an isolated, blood perfused, feline heart preparation for evaluating pharmacological interventions during myocardial ischemia. Ventricular function was measured with a fluid-filled latex balloon within the left ventricle. Vleeming et al. (1989) ligated the left coronary artery in rats after thoracotomy in ether anesthesia. Forty-eight hours after the operation, the hearts were prepared for retrograde constant pressure perfusion, according to the Langendorff technique. Igic (1996) presented a new method for the isolated working rat heart. A special double cannula was designed consisting of an outer cannula that is inserted in the aorta and an inner cannula that is advanced into the left ventricle. The perfusion fluid flows through the inner cannula into the left ventricle, and is ejected from there into the aorta. If the outer cannula system is closed, the fluid perfuses the coronary vessels and drips off outside the heart. When the outer cannula is open and certain pressure resistance is applied, a fraction of the ejected fluid perfuses the coronary vessels and the rest is expelled. Because the inner cannula can easily be retracted into the outer cannula, which is placed in the aorta, this preparation provides an opportunity to use the same heart as a \"working\" or \"non-working\" model for investigating functions of the heart.",

The function of the left ventricle was altered by changing the aortic pressure (afterload) at constant left atrial filling load (preload). By adjusting the Starling resistance, the aortic outflow could be switched during 1 min from the fixed baseline afterload to a preset higher afterload producing step-wise rises in mean arterial pressure. Lee et al. (1988) studied the effects of acute global ischemia on cytosolic calcium transients in perfused isolated rabbit hearts with the fluorescent calcium indicator indo 1. Indo 1-loaded hearts were illuminated at 360 nm, and fluorescence was recorded simultaneously at 400 and 550 nm from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. The F 400 /F 550 ratio was calculated by an analog circuit, which allowed cancellation of optical motion artifact. The resulting calcium transients were registered simultaneously with the ventricular pressure and demonstrated a rapid upstroke and slow decay similar to those recorded in isolated ventricular myocytes. Global ischemia rapidly suppressed contraction, but it produced a concurrent increase in the systolic and diastolic levels of calcium transients, together with an increase in the duration of the peak.

The left ventrolateral thorax was shaved and prepared to create a disinfected surgical access area. When stable anesthesia was achieved the animals were placed on a small animal operation table, intubated and ventilated with room air using a small animal ventilator (KTR-4, Hugo Sachs Elektronik, March-Hugstedten, Germany). The level of anesthesia was deemed as adequate following loss of the pedal withdrawal reflex and absence of the palpebral reflex. Reflexes were evaluated before surgery. The operation took 5 min. The tidal volume was adjusted at 3-5 ml and the ventilation rate was 40 breaths/min. Left thoracotomy was performed via the third intercostal space. The heart was exposed and the pericardium opened. The left main coronary artery was ligated with Perma-Hand silk 4-0 USP (Ethicon, Nordersredt, Germany) near its origin at the aorta (2 mm distal to the edge of the left atrium). Ligation resulted in infarction of the free left ventricular wall. Ligation was deemed successful when the anterior wall of the left ventricle turned pale. At this point the lungs were hyperinflated by increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure, and the chest was closed. The rats were placed on a heating pad and covered with a layer of unbleached tissue paper. The rats were extubated following return of reflexes. They were continuously monitored until they started moving in their cages. To avoid ventricular arrhythmias, lidocaine (2 mg/kg i.m.) was given before surgery. To prevent acute lung edema, the rats received furosemide (Lasix, 2 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 3 days) via the drinking water. To avoid pain and distress the rats received metamizol treatment (Novalgin, 0.1 mg/kg body weight i.m.) once, directly after the recovery period.",

Once stable anesthesia was achieved (stage III 3, reflexes absent), the animals were connected to an artificial respirator via a PE (polyethylene) tube inserted into the trachea and ventilated with room air. A transverse laparotomy and a right anterolateral thoracotomy were performed, and the heart was rapidly removed for the evaluation of its function in the working heart mode. The heart was immersed in physiological buffer chilled to 4\u00b0C. The aorta was dissected free and mounted onto a cannula (internal diameter: 1.4 mm) attached to perfusion apparatus. The hearts were perfused according to the method of Langendorff with an oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO 2 ) non-circulating Krebs-Henseleit solution of the following compositions (mM): NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.7; CaCl 2 , 2.52; MgSO 4 , 1.64; NaHCO 3 , 24.88; KH 2 PO 4 , 1.18; glucose, 5.55; and Na pyruvate, 2.0 at a perfusion pressure of 60 mmHg.

            "text": "Myocardial infarction following coronary artery ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats is a widely used rat model of heart failure. If the left coronary artery is not completely ligated, heart failure may occur as a consequence of chronic myocardial ischemia ). Johns and Olson (1954) described the coronary artery patterns for mouse, rat, hamster and guinea pig. Kaufman et al. (1959) , Fishbein et al. (1978 Fishbein et al. ( , 1980 used various histochemical methods for identification and quantification of border zones during the evolution of myocardial infarction. Sakai et al. (1981) described an experimental model of angina pectoris in the intact anesthetized rat. In anesthetized rats the tip of a special carotid cannula was placed closely to the right and left coronary ostium. Single intra-aortic injections of methacholine or acetylcholine (in the presence of physostigmine) developed a reproducible elevation of the ST segment and the T wave of the electrocardiogram. Coronary drugs were tested to prevent these changes. Ytrehus et al. (1994) analyzed the effects of anesthesia, perfusate, risk zone, and method of infarct sizing in rat and rabbit heart infarction. Lepr\u00e1n et al. (1981) placed a loose ligature of atraumatic silk around the left anterior descending coronary artery under ether anesthesia in rats. Ten days later, acute myocardial infarction was produced by tightening the ligature. Kouchi et al. (2000) found an increase in G i\u03b1 protein accompanying progression of post-infarction remodelling in hypertensive cardiomyopathy in rats. G protein \u03b1 subunits were studied with immunoblotting techniques (B\u00f6hm et al. 1990 ). The polyclonal antiserum MB1 was raised in rabbits against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of retinal transduction (KENLKDCGLF) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine. The MB1 recognized G i\u03b11 and G i\u03b12 but not G 0\u03b1 and G i\u03b13 (B\u00f6hm et al. 1994) . The membrane fractions were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were incubated with the first antibodies for G i\u03b1 (MB1) or G s\u03b1 (RM/1) and then with the second antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham).

The effect of cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of one NO synthase isoform, NOS3, on LV remodeling after myocardial infarction in mice was tested. LV structure and function before and after permanent left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation were compared in transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted NOS3 overexpression (NOS3-TG) and their wild-type littermates (WT). Before myocardial infarction, systemic hemodynamic measurements, echocardiographic assessment of LV fractional shortening (FS), heart weight, and myocyte width (as assessed histologically) did not differ in NOS3-TG and WT mice. The inotropic response to graded doses of isoproterenol was significantly reduced in NOS3-TG mice. One week after LAD ligation, the infarcted fraction of the LV did not differ in WT and NOS3-TG mice. Four weeks after myocardial infarction, however, end-systolic LV internal diameter (LVID) was greater, and FS and maximum and minimum rates of LV pressure development were less in WT than in NOS3-TG mice. LV weight/body weight ratio was greater in WT than in NOS3-TG mice. LaPointe et al. (2004) found that inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction in the mouse. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the LAD coro-nary artery in mice. Two days later, mice were treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or vehicle in drinking water for 2 weeks. After the treatment period, mice were subjected to two-dimensional M-mode echocardiography to determine cardiac function. Hearts were then analyzed for determination of infarct size, interstitial collagen content, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) mRNA, myocyte cross-sectional area, and immunohistochemical staining for transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b2 and COX-2. Shibuya et al. (2005) reported that N-acetyl-serylaspartyl-lysine-proline prevents renal insufficiency and matrix expansion in diabetic db/db mice. Weinberg et al. (2005) found in coronary ligation experiments in mice, that rosuvastatin reduces experimental left ventricular infarct size after ischemiareperfusion injury but not total coronary occlusion. Yang et al. (2005) found that the infarct-sparing effect of A 2A -adenosine receptor activation is due primarily to its action on lymphocytes. Chimeric mice were created by bone marrow transplantation from A 2A AR-knockout or green fluorescent protein (GFP) donor mice to irradiated congenic C57BL/6 (B6) recipients. In the GFP chimeras, we were unable to detect GFP-producing cells in the vascular endothelium, indicating that bone-marrow-derived cells were not recruited to endothelium at appreciable levels after bone marrow transplantation and/or acute myocardial infarction. Injection of 5 or 10 \u00b5g/kg of a potent and selective agonist of A 2A adenosine receptor had no effect on hemodynamic parameters but reduced infarct size in B6 mice after 45 min of LAD artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion.

Nachlas and Shnitka (1963) described the macroscopic identification of early myocardial infarcts by alterations in dehydrogenase activity in dogs by staining the cardiac tissue with Nitro-BT [2,2di-p-nitrophenyl-5,5 diphenyl-3,3 -(3,3 -dimethoxy-4,4 -biphenylene) ditetrazolium chloride] yielding a dark blue formazan in viable muscle but not in necrotic muscle fibers. Chiariello et al. (1976) compared the effects of nitroprusside and nitroglycerin on ischemic injury during acute myocardial infarction in dogs. Black et al. (1995) studied the cardioprotective effects of heparin or N-acetylheparin in an in vivo dog model of myocardial and ischemic reperfusion injury. The hearts were removed after 90 min of coronary occlusion and a 6 h-reperfusion period. Area at risk was determined by the absence of Evans blue dye after perfusion of the aorta in a retrograde fashion and infarct zone by the absence of formazan pigment within the area at risk after perfusion of the circumflex coronary artery with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Reimer et al. (1985) tested the effect of drugs to protect ischemic myocardium in unconscious and conscious dogs. In the conscious model, dogs of either sex weighing 10-25 kg were anesthetized with thiamyal sodium (30-40 mg/kg i.v.) and underwent thoracotomy through the 4th intercostal space. Heparinfilled polyvinyl chloride catheters were positioned in the aortic root, the left atrium via the left atrial appendage, and a systemic vein. A mechanical adjustable snare type occluder was placed around the proximal left circumflex coronary artery above or below the first marginal branch, so that temporary occlusion resulted in cyanosis of at least 75% of the inferior wall. The catheters and snare were either exteriorized or positioned in a subcutaneous pocket at the back of the neck. Penicillin, 1000,000 units, and streptomycin, 1.0 g, were given i.m. for the first 4 postoperative days, and at least 7 days were allowed for recovery from surgery.",

A hydraulic occluder was implanted around the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and an Ameroid constrictor around the left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA). Pairs of piecoelectric crystals were implanted within the subendocardium of the LAD and LCCA perfusion territories to measure regional contractile function. A catheter was placed in the left atrial appendage for injection of radioactive microspheres to measure regional myocardial perfusion. Bolus injections of adenosine were administered daily via the left atrium to evaluate LAD and LCCA coronary reserve. After stenosis by the Ameroid constrictor, radioactive microspheres were administered to compare regional perfusion within normal myocardium to flow in myocardium supplied by the occluded or stenotic coronary arteries. Holmborn et al. (1993) compared triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining versus detection of fi-bronectin in experimental myocardial infarction in pigs. Klein et al. (1995) used intact pigs and found myocardial protection by Na + /H + exchange inhibition in ischemic reperfused hearts. Klein et al. (1997) measured the time delay of cell death by Na + /H + exchange inhibition in regionally ischemic, reperfused porcine hearts. Garcia-Dorado et al. (1997) determined the effect of Na + /H + exchange blockade in ischemic rigor contracture and reperfusion-induced hypercontracture in pigs submitted to 55 min of coronary occlusion and 5 h reperfusion. Myocardial segment length analysis with ultrasonic microcristals was used to detect ischemic rigor (reduction in passive segment length change) and hypercontracture (reduction in end-diastolic length). Symons et al. (1998) tested the attenuation of regional dysfunction in response to 25 cycles of ischemia (2 min) and reperfusion (8 min) of the left circumflex coronary artery in conscious swine after administration of a Na + /H + exchange inhibitor. The animals were instrumented to measure arterial blood pressure, regional myocardial blood flow (colored microspheres), systolic wall thickening in the normally perfused left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery regions (sonomicrometry), left circumflex coronary artery blood flow velocity (Doppler) and reversibility to occlude the left circumflex coronary artery (hydraulic occluder).

Adenosine (A 1 receptor) antagonists have been demonstrated to block the protection produced by preconditioning (Liu et al. 1991) , and short term administration of adenosine was shown to simulate the protective effects of ischemic preconditioning (Toombs et al. 1993) . These observations together suggest that adenosine is generated by the short preconditioning ischemia. Other recent pharmacological studies (Gross and Auchampach 1992; Yao and Gross 1994) indicate the involvement of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Recent investigations indicate that an increase of NO production after ACE inhibitors may be a part of the protective mechanism (Linz et al. 1992 . Moreover, the involvement of prostanoids and bradykinin in the preconditioning process has been discussed (Wiemer et al. 1991) . Gho et al.

It visualizes the resonance signals of tissue protons when they are placed in a time-varying strong magnetic field. The most frequently used parameters measured in MS are the spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1 ) and the spin-spin relaxation time (T 2 ). MRI is routinely used as a tomographic imaging technique, where anatomical pictures are created of 1-mm-thick tissue sections. The contrast differences between brain structures in most MRI techniques are determined by the different densities and diffusion of protons, as well as differences in relaxation times. T 2 images are sensitive to water and, because all pathological alterations in MS brains are associated with altered distribution of tissue water (edema), this technique is highly useful for visualization of the spatial distribution of lesions. Contrast in T 1 images is determined mainly by different lattice densities. Dense structures, such as compact white matter, have low T 1 values, whereas relatively loose structures, such as grey matter or lesions, have higher T 1 values.",

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring used shielded subcutaneous electrodes and a Tektronix 2225 oscilloscope. The cine imaging protocols were performed with the anesthetized animal placed in a specially designed home-built half-sine-spaced birdcage radiofrequency (RF) probe unit contained within a cylindrical plastic holder fitted within a gradient set of internal diameter 11 cm. The RF probe unit was made up of a half-sine spaced birdcage RF probe of internal diameter of 4.5 cm with open ends, an RF shield consisting of a cylinder of copper gauze surrounding and sliding over the birdcage, a tuning capacitor and a coaxial cable to carry the RF (Ballon et al. 1990 ). The assembly included ECG leads, attachment plugs for the ECG leads and a unit to anchor anesthetic delivery tubes near the nose of the animal. All experiments used a 2 T Oxford Instruments (UK) superconducting magnet with a horizontal internal bore of 31 cm. A gated cine protocol synchronized line acquisition to set times following alternate electrocardiographic R waves. This acquisition was then repeated at the same slice position at 12 equally incremented times through the cardiac cycle. This sequence in turn was repeated for each of the 128 lines to generate each 128 \u00d7 128 image, which itself was acquired twice for signal averaging. The preceding procedure was in turn repeated 12 times to obtain signal-averaged images for every one of the 12 contiguous transverse slices examined. Each imaging session therefore required (128 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2) times the cardiac cycle duration. The effective repeat time (TR) was approximately 13 ms. The short echo time (TE) of 4.3 ms reduced motion artifacts and ensured good contrast between blood and myocardium.",

Then, the tissue is digested with 35% potassium hydroxide. The method gives stable preparations which can be preserved for a long time.",

The results of post mortem Araldit impletion agree with the functional results of experimental coronary occlusion. Boor and Reynolds (1977) Cellular calcium flux is regulated by receptor-operated and voltage-dependent channels, which are sensitive to inhibition by calcium entry blockers. The term calcium antagonist was introduced by Fleckenstein (1964 Fleckenstein ( , 1967 when two drugs, prenylamine and verapamil, originally found as coronary dilators in the LANGEN-DORFF-experiment, were shown to mimic the cardiac effects of simple Ca 2+ -withdrawal, diminishing Ca 2+dependent high energy phosphate utilization, contractile force, and oxygen requirement of the beating heart without impairing the Na + -dependent action potential parameters. These effects were clearly distinguishable from \u03b2-receptor blockade and could promptly be neutralized by elevated Ca 2+ , \u03b2-adrenergic catecholamines, or cardiac glycosides, measures that restore the Ca 2+ supply to the contractile system. In the following years many Ca 2+ -antagonists were introduced to therapy. Specific Ca 2+ -antagonists interfere with the uptake of Ca 2+ into the myocardium and prevent myocardial necrotization arising from deleterious intracellular Ca 2+ overload. They act basically as spe-cific inhibitors of the slow transsarcolemnal Ca 2+ influx but do not or only slightly affect the fast Na + current that initiates normal myocardial excitation. Calcium channels and the sites of action of drugs modifying channel function have been classified (Bean 1989; Porzig 1990; Tsien and Tsien 1990; Spedding and Paoletti 1992) .",

Similar to the heart rate, the electrocardiogram is different between various species (Bazett 1920; Kisch 1953; Heise and Kimbel 1955; Beinfield and Lehr 1968; Budden et al. 1981; Driscoll 1981; Osborn 1981; Hayes et al. 1994) . Many authors used the bipolar lead II between right foreleg and left hindleg, which is in line with the neutrally placed heart. Additionally, lead I (between right and left foreleg) stated to lie in the axis of the horizontal heart, and lead III (between left foreleg and left hindleg) in line with the vertical heart, may be used as well as unipolar leads (usually designed as V 1 to V 6 ) and the unipolar leads designed as aVL, aVR, and aVF. Out of several species being used the procedure for rats (Penz et al. 1992; Hayes et al. 1994 ) is described.",

The effect of the test compound on the basal heart rate was then examined and the percentage change in the heart rate was calculated. Seven min later, the arrhythmogenic dose of CaCl 2 was readministered and the effect of the treatment on the induced arrhythmia parameters was evaluated as percentage change in the measured parameters or as protection or non-protections against the induced fibrillations.",

Systolic arte-rial pressure is monitored and body temperature maintained by a thermal blanket. The chest is opened by a midline sternotomy and the heart suspended in a pericardial cradle. The sinus node is crushed and a 2.0 mm diameter Ag-AgCl stimulating electrode is embedded in a Teflon disc sutured to the anterior surface of the left ventricle. The heart is then driven by 3-ms square anodal constant current pulses for 400 ms of the basic cycle and is prematurely stimulated by one 3-ms test stimulus through the driving electrode. Electrical stimulation is programmed by a digital stimulator. A recording electrode is placed on the surface of each ventricle. A silver plate is implanted under the skin in the right femoral region as indifferent electrode. Lead II of the body surface electrocardiogram is monitored. To determine ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT), a 0.2-to 1.8-second train of 50-Hz pulses is delivered 100 ms after every eighteenth basic driving stimulus. The current intensity is increased from the diastolic threshold in increments of 10 \u00b5A to 1.0 mA or until ventricular fibrillation occurs. The minimal current intensity of the pulse train required to induce sustained ventricular fibrillation is defined as the VFT. When ventricular fibrillation occurs, the heart is immediately defibrillated and allowed to recover to control conditions for 15 to 20 min. Anti-arrhythmic drugs are administered through the femoral vein.",

A left thoracotomy is performed between the fourth and fifth ribs, and the heart is exposed and suspended in a pericardial cradle. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is isolated at the tip of the left atrial appendage, and the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) is iso-lated \u223c1 cm from its origin. After a 20-gauge hypodermic needle has been placed on the LAD, a ligature is tied around the artery and the needle. The needle is then removed, resulting in critical stenosis of the vessel. The LAD is perfused for 5 min in the presence of the critical stenosis. Ischemic injury of the anterior ventricular myocardium is achieved by 2-h occlusion of the LAD by a silicon rubber snare. The vessel is reperfused after 2 h in the presence of the critical stenosis. During the period of LAD reperfusion, an epicardial bipolar electrode (1-mm silver posts, 3mm interelectrode separation) is sutured on the left atrial appendage for subsequent atrial pacing. A bipolar plunge electrode (25-gauge stainless steel, 5 mm long, 3 mm separation) is sutured on the interventricular septum, adjacent to the occlusion site and overlying the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Two similar stainless steel bipolar plunge electrodes are sutured to the left ventricular (LV) wall: one at the distribution of the LAD distal to the occlusion (infarct zone, IZ), and the second in the distribution of the LCX (non-infarct zone, NZ). A 30-gauge silver-coated copper wire electrode is passed through the wall and into the lumen of the LCX and sutured to the adjacent surface of the heart. Silver disc electrodes are implanted subcutaneously for ECG monitoring. The surgical incision is closed and the animals are allowed to recover.",

These facts warrant the use of complicated models in higher animals for search of active drugs. described an experimental preparation for sudden cardiac death in dogs. The animals were chronically instrumented and studied 1 month after an anterior myocardial infarction. A balloon catheter around the circumflex coronary artery was inflated to produce acute myocardial ischemia and the occlusion was maintained for 2 min. Several days later, the animals were subjected to a submaximal stress on a motor-driven treadmill for 12-18 min. During the last minute of exercise the left coronary artery was occluded, the treadmill stopped, and the occlusion was maintained for a second minute. Schwartz et al. (1988) analyzed the baroreceptor reflexes in conscious dogs with and without a myocardial infarction to get insights in the mechanisms of sudden death. Cahn and Cervoni (1990) reviewed of the use of animal models of sudden cardiac death for drug development. Pak et al. (1997) found that canine tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is a useful model for studying mechanisms and therapy of sudden cardiac death in heart failure. Adamson et al. (1994) performed a longitudinal study in dogs at high and low risk for sudden death and found an unexpected interaction between \u03b2adrenergic blockade and heart rate variability before and after myocardial infarction. Basso et al. (2004) recommended arrhythmogenic right ventriculopathy causing sudden death in boxer dogs as an animal model of human disease. Schwartz Billman and his group developed methods to evaluate antiarrhythmic drugs for their activity in cardiovascular parameters in an exercise-plus-ischemia test.",

The animals are given Innovar Vet (0.02 mg/kg fentanyl citrate and 1 mg/kg hydroperidol i.v.) as a preanesthetic, whereas a surgical plane of anesthesia is induced with sodium pentobarbital (10 mg/kg i.v.). A left thoracotomy is made in the fourth intercostal space, and the heart is exposed and supported by a pericardial cradle. A 20-MHz pulsed Doppler flow transducer and a hydraulic occluder are placed around the left circumflex artery. A pair of insulated silver-coated wires are sutured to the epicardial surface of both the left and right ventricles. These electrodes are used for ventricular pacing or to record a ventricular electrogram from which HR is determined using a Gould Biotachometer (Gould Instruments, Cleveland, OH) . A precalibrated solid-state pressure transducer (Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, CA) is inserted into the left ventricle via a stab wound in the apical dimple. Finally, a two-stage occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery is performed approximately one third the distance from the origin to induce an anterior wall myocardial infarction. This vessel is partially occluded for 20 min and then tied off. All leads from the cardiovascular instrumentation are tunneled under the skin to exit on the back of the animal's neck. A transdermal fentanyl patch that delivers 75 \u00b5g/h for 72 h is placed on the back of the neck (secured with adhesive tape) to decrease postoperative discomfort. In addition, bupivacaine HCl, a long-acting local anesthetic, is injected to block the intercostal nerves (i. e., pain fibers) in the area of the incision.

Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Blockade of cardiac potassium channels and the resulting prolongation of repolarization and refractoriness is the mode of action of class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the human heart, the ultrarapid delayed rectifier potassium current (I Kur ) was identified in atrial, but not in ventricular tissue. It appears to contribute to action potential repolarization in the atrium but not the ventricle. The molecular correlate of the human cardiac ultrarapid delayed rectifier potassium current seems to be the Kv1.5 protein (Fedida et al. 1993; Wang et al. 1993; Feng et al. 1997 Feng et al. , 1998 . Since prolongation of ventricular repolarization seems to be invariably associated with proarrhythmia (early afterdepolarizations leading to torsades de pointes arrhythmia) as shown with available potassium channel blockers (class III drugs) such as the highly se-lective and potent I Kr -channel blocker dofetilide (Torp-Pedersen et al. 1999 ), blockade of a cardiac current that is exclusively present in the atria is highly desirable as it is expected to be devoid of ventricular proarrhythmic effects. Therefore, the atrial Kv1.5 channel is a highly attractive target in the search for new and safer atrial antiarrhythmic drugs (Nattel and Singh 1999) .",

The purpose of the 1.5 Hz insert is to keep \"pacing history\" constant as well as to minimize progressive, nonspecific depression during the lower frequency stimulation series. Both pre-and postdrug developed tension (at each frequency) are expressed as a percentage of the predrug developed tension at 1 Hz. The percent change in post treatment (versus pretreatment) developed tension at 1 Hz is used to quantitate an agent's inotropic effect.",

From analysis of action potential it is concluded that at low concentrations contraction is depressed mainly due to a Na + channel block, whereas at high concentrations also Ca 2+ channels may be blocked. Kodama et al. (1992) , Maryuama et al.

Borchard et al. (1982) described a method for inducing arrhythmias or asystolia by the application of 50 Hz alternating current (ac) to electrically driven isolated left atria and right papillary muscles of the guinea pig. An increase in driving frequency from 1 to 3 Hz effected a significant reduction of the threshold of ac-arrhythmia in guinea pig papillary muscle, but no change in atria. A decrease in temperature from 31\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and an increase in Ca 2+ from 1.25 to 5 mmol/l elevated the threshold for ac-arrhythmia and -asystolia. Fast sodium channel inhibitors increased threshold of acarrhythmia in left atria and papillary muscles, whereas the slow channel inhibitor verapamil was ineffective in concentrations up to 6 \u00b5mol/l.",

The level of anesthesia was deemed as adequate following loss of the pedal withdrawal reflex and absence of the palpebral reflex. The tidal volume was adjusted at 3-5 ml and the ventilation rate was 40 breaths/min. Left thoracotomy was performed via the third intercostal space. The heart was exposed and the pericardium opened. The left main coronary artery was ligated with Perma-Hand silk 4-0 USP (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) near its origin at the aorta (2 mm distal to the edge of the left atrium). Ligation resulted in infarction of the free left ventricular wall. Ligation was deemed successful when the anterior wall of the left ventricle turned pale. At this point the lungs were hyperinflated by increasing the positive endexpiratory pressure, and the chest was closed. The rats were placed on a heating pad. They were continuously monitored until they start moving in their cages. To avoid ventricular arrhythmias, lidocaine (2mg/kg i.m.) was given before surgery. The sham procedure consisted of opening the pericardium and placing a superficial suture in the epicardium of the LV. To prevent acute lung edema, the rats received furosemide 2 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days via the drinking water.",

MRI data acquisition was gated to the cardiac cycle by a Physiograd SM 785 MR monitoring system (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Two sets of transverse images were acquired, one at end-systole and another at enddiastole. End-diastole was defined as the image obtained 8 ms after the onset of the R wave of the ECG, corresponding to the largest cavity area. End-systole was defined as the image with the smallest LV cavity area. The image analysis was done using Bruker software (Karlsruhe, Germany).

            "text": "A simple and rapid method of developing high output heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy in rats by producing aortacaval shunts was described by Garcia and Diebold (1990) . Rats weighing 180-200 g were anesthetized with 30 mg/kg i.p. pentobarbitone. The vena cava and the abdominal aorta were exposed by opening the abdominal cavity via a midline incision. The aorta was punctured at the union of the segment two-thirds caudal to the renal artery and one-third cephalic to the aortic bifurcation with an 18-gauge disposable needle. The needle was advanced into the aorta, perforating its adjacent wall and penetrating in the vena cava. A bulldog vascular clamp was placed across the aorta caudal to the left renal artery. Once the aorta was clamped, the needle was fully withdrawn and a drop of cyanoacrylate glue was used to seal the aorta-punctured point. The clamp was removed 30 s later. The patency of the shunt was verified visually by swelling vena cava and the mixing of arterial and venous blood. The peritoneal cavity was closed with silk thread stitches and the skin with metallic clips. Rats with aorta-caval shunts developed cardiac hypertrophy with significantly higher absolute and relative heart weights.",

The forth intercostal space is opened with two blunted forceps. The heart is pressed against the opening with the left hand. The pericardium is opened with a fine forceps and pulled back to the basis of the heart. The beating heart is extruded from the thorax wound by pressure with the left hand on the right thorax wall.

The disease originates from an autosomal, recessively transmissible disorder, which leads to degenerative lesions in all striated muscles and in particular in the myocardium. Histopathological changes consist of myocytolytic necrosis followed by fibrosis and calcification. The evolution of the cardiomyopathic disease can be characterized by five distinct phases: A prenecrotic stage, in which no pathology is evident, a time of active myocytolysis and cellular necrosis, a phase of fibrosis and calcium deposition, an overlapping period of reactive hypertrophy of the remaining viable myocytes, and a final stage of depressed myocardial performance and failure.",

(1991) published a method to induce acute, reversible tricuspid insufficiency in anesthetized dogs. A wire spiral is advanced through the atrioventricular canal from the right atrium. The spiral causes regurgitation by preventing complete apposition of the valve leaflets while permitting retrograde flow to occur through the spiral lumen. The degree of regurgitation can be controlled by the use of spirals of different size. Creation of tricuspid insufficiency was demonstrated by onset of right atrial pressure V waves, a ballooning of the right atrium during ventricular systole, palpation of an atrial thrill, or by color Doppler echocardiography. The model is reversible and allows repeated trials of various grades of regurgitation. Carlyle and Cohn (1983) described a non-chirurgical model of chronic left ventricular dysfunction. The method is accomplished by repetitive DC shock with a guidewire introduced percutaneously and positioned in the left ventricle along the intraventricular septum and an external paddle at the left ventricular apex. produced localized left ventricular necrosis without obstruction of the coronary blood flow in dogs by transmyocardial direct-current shock. Sabbah et al. ( , 1993 Sabbah et al. ( , 1994 and Gengo et al. (1992) produced chronic heart failure in dogs by multiple sequential intracoronary embolizations with microspheres. The dogs underwent three to nine intracoronary embolizations with polystyrene latex microspheres (70-102 \u00b5m in diameter) performed 1-3 weeks apart. Embolizations were discontinued when left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 35%. used multiple coronary microembolizations in dogs, whereby three to nine embolizations were performed 1 week apart. The first three embolizations consisted of 2 ml of microsphere suspension injected subselectively into either the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary artery in an alternating fashion. Subsequent embolizations consisted of 3-6 ml of microspheres divided equally between the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary artery until LV ejection fraction was < 35%. Magovern et al. (1992) described a canine model of left ventricular dysfunction caused by five weekly intracoronary infusions of adriamycin. Koide (1997) described premorbid determinants of left ventricular dysfunction in a model of gradually induced pressure overload in dogs. Mongrel dogs were studied through 8 weeks of gradually imposed ascending aortic constriction with the use of a novel banding technique. During banding, an initial gradient of 30 mmHg was created. Before banding, at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after banding, hemodynamics and left ventricular mechanics were examined at cardiac catheterization; then the pressure overload was increased by tightening the band. Valentine et al. (1988) and Devaux et al. (1993) described X-linked muscular dystrophy in dogs with cardiac insufficiency similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in men and recommended this as an animal model for cardiac insufficiency. Cardiac failure was studied in pigs using several experimental procedures. Chow et al. (1990) recommended rapid ventricular pacing in pigs as an experimental model of congestive heart failure. Farrar et al. (1993) studied pacing-induced dilated cardiomyopathy in pigs. Congestive heart failure was produced by rapid ventricular pacing at 230 bpm for 1 week. Spinale et al. (1990a Spinale et al. ( , 1990b Spinale et al. ( , 1991 Spinale et al.

Catheters connected to a vascular access port were placed in the thoracic aorta, the pulmonary artery, and the left atrium. The access ports were then placed in a subcutaneous pocket. A 20-mm flow probe was placed around the pulmonary artery immediately distal to the pulmonary catheter and the electrical connection exteriorized through the thoracolumbar fascia. A shielded stimulating electrode was sutured onto the left atrium, connected to a programmable pacemaker and buried in a subcutaneous pocket. The thoracotomy was closed in layers and the pleural space evacuated of air. After a 14-to 21-day recovery, measurements were performed under normal resting conditions and after exercise. The pacemakers were activated to 240 bpm for a period of 21 days. During the last 3 days, one group was treated with drug, the other served as control. At the day of the study, electrocardiograms were performed, and the pacemakers deactivated. After a 30-min stabilization period, 2-D and M-mode echocardiographic studies were used to image the left ventricle from the parasternal approach. Left ventricular fractional shortening was calculated as (end-diastolic dimension -end-systolic dimension)/diastolic dimension, and was expressed as a percentage. The access ports were entered and pressures obtained using externally calibrated transducers. The flow probe was connected to a digital flowmeter. From the digitized flow signal, stroke volume was computed on a beat-to-beat basis and averaged for a minimum of 25 ejections. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were computed as the mean pressure divided by cardiac output multiplied by the constant 80 to convert to resistance units of dyne\u00b7 s\u00b7cm \u22125 . Samples were drawn from the pulmonary artery and atrial catheters for measurement of oxygen saturation and hemoglobin content.

Animals then were placed on their left side in a Helmholtz coil with a diameter of 18 cm, which was used to improve signal to noise. To compute LV wall stress, the image acquisition was triggered by the LV pressure through the fluid-filled LV catheter. All of the imaging sequences were synchronized to the LV pressure trace. The electronic LV pressure signal was recorded and fed to a comparator set to a threshold level of 10% of the upslope of the LV pressure curve at the beginning of systole. The signal from the comparator was sent to a pulse former and then fed to the ECG port of the magnetic resonance system, where it was treated like the standard electrographic input to run the pulse sequences.

The sequence used segmented k-space acquisition such that three phase-encoded lines were gathered per cardiac phase per heartbeat. Total image acquisition required approximately 52 heartbeats for each slice location. The temporal im-age resolution (data acquisition window) of this sequence was 33 ms per cardiac image. Each myocardial level took < 1.5 min to acquire, since two acquisitions were used and the average heart rate of the animals was 120 bpm. The average number of short-axis slices needed to image the entire myocardium from apex to base was six to eight. This 10-min protocol provided high signal-to-noise cine sequences covering the entire heart.",

The program is based on robust deformable models of endocardial and epicardial border segmentation of ventricular boundaries in cardiac magnetic resonance images. This segmentation technique has been combined with a user interface that allows one to load, sort, visualize, and analyze a cardiac study in < 20 min. The segmentation algorithm is based on the steepest descent as well as dynamic programming strategies integrated via multiscale analysis for minimizing the energy function of the resulting contour. The ventricular boundaries are used to construct a three-dimensional model for visualization and to compute hemodynamic parameters. Automatic segmentation of endocardial and epicardial boundaries was performed for calculation of ventricular volumes, EF, LV diastolic and systolic volumes, and absolute myocardial mass from multislice, multiphase magnetic resonance cine images. Starting with a user-specified approximate boundary or an interior point of the ventricle for one starting image in one slice, the algorithm generated automatic contours corresponding to the epicardium and the endocardium and automatically propagated them to other slices in the cardiac phase (spatial propagation) and to other phases for a given slice location (temporal propagation) of the cardiac study. The observer then could make some manual corrections to the six or seven pairs of contours in the first column of the temporal-spatial matrix. Manual modifications generally were made on the apex and base levels.",

The thickness of the scar was averaged from three measurements of the scar area. LVSA measurement in each slice was computed by subtracting the total area enclosed by the endocardium from that enclosed by the subepicardium; the resultant area was multiplied by the slice thickness to obtain the volume of each slice; the total LV mass volume was calculated by adding up the volumes of all the short-axis slices. The total LVSA was obtained by dividing the total LV wall mass volume by the mean of LV wall thickness of each slice. Similarly, the LVSSA was obtained by dividing the total scar volume, which was the sum of the scar volume of each short axis, by the mean of the scar thickness of each short axis. LV mass was computed by the total LV wall mass volume multiplied by 1.05 (specific gravity of myocardium) to calculate the LV mass. The LV enddiastolic volume (V d ) and end-systolic volume (V s ) of each slice were represented by the area enclosed by the endocardium. The total LV volume was computed by adding the volumes of all slices. LVEF was calculated by 100 \u00d7 (V-V s )/V d %. Interobserver and intraobserver errors for the calculations of LV mass and LV volumes have been shown to be < 3 mg and 3 ml, respectively (McDonald et al. 1994) .

The coil was cemented to a sheet of silicone rubber 0.7 mm in thickness and \u224850% larger in diameter than the coil itself. A capillary containing 15 \u00b5l of 3 M phosphonoacetic acid was placed at the coil center to serve as a reference. The proton signal from water detected with the surface coil was used to homogenize the magnetic field and to adjust the position of the animal in the magnet so that the coil was at or near the magnet and gradient isocenters. This was accomplished with a spin-echo experiment and a readout gradient. The information gathered in this step also was used to determine the spatial coordinates for spectroscopic localization. Chemical shifts were measured relative to CP, which was assigned a chemical shift of -2.55 ppm relative to 85% phosphoric acid at 0 ppm. Spatial localization across the LV wall was performed with the RAPP-ISIS/FSW method (Hendrich et al. 1991) . Signal origin was restricted with the use of B 0 gradients and adiabatic inversion pulses to a column coaxial with the surface coil perpendicular to the LV wall. The column dimensions were 17 \u00d7 17 mm. Within this column, the signal was further localized using the B 1 gradient to five voxels centered about 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and 135\u00b0spin rotation increments. FSW localization used a nine-term Fourier series expansion. The Fourier coefficients, the number of free induction decays acquired for each term in the Fourier expansion, and the multiplication factors used to construct the voxels have been reported previously. The position of the voxels relative to the coil was set using the B 1 magnitude at the coil center, which was experimentally determined in each case by measurement of the 90\u00b0pulse length for the phosphonoacetic acid reference located in the coil center. Each set of spatially localized transmural spectra were acquired in 10 min. A total of 96 scans was accumulated within each 10min block.",

They were standardized in units of an international standard. Some of the pharmacological methods used for these purposes and adopted by many pharmacopoeias have nowadays historical interest only. This holds true for the frog method and the pigeon method (Burn et al. 1950 ). Particularly, the frog method was used for standardization. The method adopted by the U.S Pharmacopoeia X was the 1 h test. Healthy frogs (Rana pipiens) weighing 20-30 g were selected from the cold storage room. One hour before assay, their weight was recorded and they were placed in wire cages with a water depth of 1 cm. The doses of digitalis were calculated so that they approximated 0.015 ml/g body weight. Injections were made into the ventral lymph sac. One hour later, the animals were pithed and the heart removed and examined. Systolic arrest of the ventricle and widely dilated atrium indicated the typical result. Calculations of activity in terms of International Units were made from the percentage of dead animals in the test group versus those in the group receiving the international standard.",

Clamping of both carotid arteries induces a bilateral temporary brain ischemia (Levine and Sohn 1969; Bosma et al. 1981; Mr\u0161ulja et al. 1983; Hossmann et al. 1983; Chandler et al. 1985) . This pathological animal model allows the simulation of circulatory disturbances in the human brain. The hippocampus is one of the most vulnerable regions of the brain to ischemia and anoxia. The gerbil is known to develop selective neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus following brief periods of forebrain ischemia. This damage differs from conventionally described ischemic neuronal injury because of its slow development (Ito et al. 1975; Kirino 1982; Hossmann et al. 1983 ). The occlusion time can be varied allowing determination of various parameters, e. g. ischemia induced amnesia (see Sect. F.3.1.8).",

Fifteen minutes before surgery, the gerbils receive the test compound by oral or intraperitoneal administration. The control group is treated with vehicle alone. The exposure of the common carotid arteries is performed under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (32 mg/kg i.p.), chloralhydrate (100 mg/kg i.p.) and atropine sulfate (0.8 mg/kg i.p.). The carotid arteries are isolated from surrounding tissue and a loop of un-waxed dental floss is placed around each artery. A 2 cm length of double lumen catheter is passed from the level of carotid artery through the muscle layers of the dorsal surface of the neck. Each end of dental floss is threaded through a separate lumen, leaving a loose loop around the artery. Two days later, occlusion of each artery is produced by gently pulling the dental floss until the artery is completely occluded between the floss and the center wall of the catheter. Heifitz clips are placed on the floss against the exterior end of the tubing to maintain occlusion. After various intervals (5 to 30 min), the clips are removed and circulation is restored.",

The fibres were fixed to the cranium using dental wax. The dialysate was collected in 5 min intervals, and the concentrations of adenosine, hypoxanthine and inosine were determined by HPLC (Zetterstr\u00f6m et al. 1982; Fredholm et al. 1984) . Kindy et al. (1992) measured glial fibrillary acid protein and vimentine on mRNA level by Northern blot analysis and protein content by immunoblot analysis in the gerbil neocortex, striatum and hippocampus after transient ischemia. McRae et al. (1994) studied the effect of drug treatment on activated microglial antigens in hippocampal sections after ischemia in gerbils with cerebral fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease and the amyloid precursor protein. Nurse and Corbett (1996) found neuroprotection in gerbils with global cerebral ischemia after several days of mild, drug-induced hypothermia. The protection by the AMPA-antagonist NBQX may be due to a decrease in body temperature. A protracted period of subnormal temperature during the postischemic period can obscure the interpretation of preclinical studies. Smith et al.

Cerebral blood flow was measured with the radioactive microsphere technique. Lin et al. (2003) described a model of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm in mice. Adult mice received injections of autologous blood into the cisterna magna. The diameters of large intracranial vessels were measured 1 h to 7 days after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. A diffuse blood clot was evident in both the anterior and posterior circulations. Vascular wall thickening, lumenal narrowing, and corrugation of the internal elastic lamina were observed. Both acute (6-12 h) and delayed (1-3 days) phases of vasoconstriction occurred after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Overall mortality was only 3%. The model is recommended for screening of therapeutic candidates.",

In independent experiments, three coronal slices were recorded, thus covering the central part of the ischemic lesion. Measurement parameters were: TE = 3.5 ms, TR = 7.4 ms, MATRIX = 128 \u00d7 64, AV-ERAGE = 8. Each experiment consisted of two image acquisitions separated by a recovery period. During the first acquisition, blood flowing through the neck was adiabatically inverted (preparation TIME = 3 s; zgradient = 5 mT/m; B1 FIELD = 150 mG; off-resonance FREQUENCY = 6000 Hz; mean preparation DIS-TANCE = 2.8 cm upstream from the imaging plane); in the second acquisition, inflowing spins were left undisturbed. Both phases were separated by a recovery period of 10 s. In each perfusion experiment, the two images suffered the same signal loss due to magnetization transfer effects but differed in the magnetization of the inflowing blood. Perfusion-weighted images were obtained by subtraction of the acquisitions with and without prior adiabatic spin inversion. In the second acquisition, inflowing spins were left undisturbed. Perfusion-weighted images were obtained by subtraction of the acquisitions with and without prior adiabatic spin inversion.",

The femoral vein is cannulated for systemic injections. After administration of 5 mg/kg heparin sodium i.v., the saphenous vein and the femoral artery are cannulated. The venous cannula is placed approximately 1 cm distal to its junction with another vein. After the non-perfused branch of the junction is ligated, constant blood flow is maintained from the femoral artery by using a Sigmamotor pump. The flow is adjusted so that a normal physiologic pressure in the vein is maintained. Perfusion pressure is measured between the pump and the vein so that any changes in pressure reflect changes in venous resistance. The peak changes in perfusion pressure are used to measure pressure changes from recorded data. The blood flow is maintained on a constant level. Therefore, changes in pressure must reflect changes in resistance. Pressure is recorded with a polygraph using an Statham pressure transducer (P23AA). In addition to recording perfusion pressure, venous pressure is measured at two additional points along the vein. In order to record venous pressure centrally from the site of perfusion, the shaft of a 27-gauge needle is placed into the end of a 10 cm piece of a thin Silastic tubing. At the other end, a 27 gauge needle is inserted and attached to a Statham pressure transducer (P23B). Pressure is recorded on a polygraph. One needle is inserted into the vein just proximal of the junction of the two veins. The second needle is placed into the vein so that the distance between the tip of the perfusion cannula and the first needle is the same as the distance between the two needles. In this way pressure decreases across the junction and an adjacent segment can be measured simultaneously. Injections of test compounds are made into the cannula between the pump and the saphenous vein. Changes in pressure measured by the three transducers are recorded.

On incubation day 3, a square window is opened in the shell and 2 to 3 ml of albumen is removed to allow detachment of the developing chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The window is sealed with a glass and the eggs are returned to the incubator. On day 8, 1 mm 3 gelatin sponges loaded with 3 \u00b5l phosphate-buffered saline alone as the negative control or containing 3 \u00b5g (1 mg/ml) of the angiogenic recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor alone as positive control, or together with various doses of test compound, are implanted on top of the CAM. The sponge traps the sample and allows slow release of the product. CAM are examined daily until day 12, when the angiogenic response peaks. On day 12, blood vessels entering the sponge within the focal plane of the CAM are recognized microscopically, counted by two observers in a double-blind fashion under a Zeiss SR stereomicroscope, and photographed in ovo with the MC63 Camera system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To better highlight vessels, the CAM are injected into a large allantoic vein with India ink solution, fixed in Serra's fluid, dehydrated in graded ethanols, and rendered transparent in methylbenzoate. On day 12, after microscopic counting, the embryos and their membranes are fixed in ovo in Bouin's fluid. The sponges and the underlying and immediately adjacent CAM portions are removed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 8 \u00b5m along a plane parallel to the CAM surface, and stained with a 0.5% aqueous solution of toluidine blue.",

The air sacs are re-inflated every forth day. The wall of the air sac becomes progressively thicker with time and after approximately 10 days a sufficient lining of cells has been established. For sponge implantation, the animals are anesthetized again. A 1.5 cm incision is made through the clipped skin covering the air sac and blunt dissection is used to open a 2 cm deep cavity towards the cranial base of the air sac by careful separation of the skin from the membrane. A cellulose implant (Spontex sponge) with a diameter of 8 mm is carefully pressed into the cavity of the membrane away from the incision site and the incision closed by sutures. The animals are treated for 10 days with various doses of test compound in a volume of 10 ml/kg or vehicle. The subcutaneous injection is made under light CO 2 /O 2 anesthesia into the hind leg 5-7 cm away from the air sac. This injection site is chosen to eliminate any risk of inducing irritative side-effects on the membrane. After 10 days treatment, the animals are sacrificed after having received 20 min before an injection of 1 \u00b5Ci of 125 I-labelled immunoglobulin via the tail vein.

Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkThe peptide apelin, consisting of 36 amino acids, is found increasingly to play a role in biology and medicine(Kleinz and Davenport 2005; Masri et al.  2005). The family of apelin peptides is derived from a single gene and activates the 7-transmembrane Gprotein-coupled receptor APJ. In the search for an endogenous ligand of the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor APJ,Tatemoto et al. (1998)  isolated and characterized endogenous peptide ligands, designated apelin, from bovine stomach extracts. Apelin-13, consisting of 13 amino acids, was more active than apelin-36. APJ was first identified in a human gene by O'Dowd et al.",

A.3.1.2 and A.3.1.3, the isolated heart according to LANGENDORFF and the isolated working rat heart preparation can be used for ligation experiments inducing arrhythmias. Lubbe et al. (1978) reported ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in the isolated perfused rat heart as a model for assessment of anti-fibrillatory action of anti-arrhythmic agents.Bernier et al. (1986) described reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in the isolated perfused rat heart. The isolated rat heart was perfused according the LANGEN-DORFF-technique. A ligature was placed around the left anterior descending coronary artery close to its ori-gin. The arterial occlusion was maintained for 10 min followed by reperfusion. Test compounds were included in the perfusion medium. With epicardial ECGelectrodes the number of premature ventricular complexes, the incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation, and the incidence of ventricular tachycardia were recorded. Abraham et al. (1989) tested antiarrhythmic properties of tetrodotoxin against occlusion-induced arrhythmias produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the rat. MacLeod et al. (1989) tested a long acting analogue of verapamil for its actions against arrhythmias induced by ischemia and reperfusion in conscious and anesthetized rats, as well as for effects on epicardial intracellular action potentials. Harper et al. (1993) found that the inhibition of Na + /H + exchange preserves viability, restores mechanical function, and prevents the pH paradox in reperfusion injury to rat neonatal myocytes. Scholz et al. (1993 Scholz et al. ( , 1995 reported protective effects of HOE642, a selective sodium-hydrogen exchange subtype 1 inhibitor, on cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion in rats. Likewise, Yasutake et al. (1994) found protection against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in rats by intracoronary infusion of a Na + /H + exchange inhibitor. Aye et al. (1997) tested the effects of a Na + /H + exchange inhibitor on reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias in rat hearts. Ferrara et al. (1990) studied the effect of flecainide acetate on reperfusion-and barium-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the isolated perfused rat heart by monitoring heart rate, coronary flow rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, dp/dt max , and the voltage of the epicardial electrogram.Heterogeneity of ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction in rats has been reported by Capasso et al. (1992) . Bellemin-Baurreau et al. (1994) described an in vitro method for evaluation of antiarrhythmic and antiischemic agents by using programmed electrical stimulation of the isolated rabbit heart after ligation of the left ventricular branch of the coronary artery and a reperfusion period of 15 min.The use of the rat in models for the study of arrhythmias in myocardial ischemia and infarction has been reviewed by Curtis et al. (1987) . Black and Rodger (1996) , Black (2000) reviewed the methods used to study experimental myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury in various animal species. described a canine model of atrial fibrillation due to chronic atrial dilatation. Courtemanche et al. (1999) and Ramirez et al. (2000) published mathematical models of fibrillationinduced electrical remodeling and of canine atrial action potentials. Pinto and Boyden (1999) reviewed electrical remodeling in ischemia and infarction. Cabo and Boyden (2003) performed a computational analysis of electrical remodeling of the epicardial border zone in the canine infarcted heart. Sakabe et al. (2004) reported that enalapril prevents perpetuation of atrial fibrillation by suppressing atrial fibrosis and over-expression of connexin43 in a canine model of atrial pacing-induced left ventricular dysfunction. Baartscheer et al. (2005) induced combined volume and pressure overload in New Zealand white rabbits. In a first surgical procedure, volume overload was produced by rupture of the aortic valve until pulse pressure increased by about 100%, and after 3 weeks, pressure overload was created by suprarenal abdominal aortic constriction of 50%. In these animals, chronic inhibition of the Na + /H + exchanger attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and prevented cellular remodeling in heart failure.",

A mildly constricting band was placed around the ascending aorta of very young guinea pigs (225-275 g) . With growth to 500-1000 g, left ventricular systolic pressure increased and ventricular hypertrophy developed. Only some of the animals developed dyspnea and severe ventricular dysfunction. Kiss et al. (1995) studied the effects on Ca 2+ transport and mechanics in compensated pressure-overload hypertrophy and congestive heart failure in guinea pigs. The descending aorta was banded for 4 and 8 weeks in adult guinea pigs. Tweedle et al.

            "text": "Adult male baboons (Papio anubis) weighing 21-30 kg were pre-instrumented for physiological monitoring in a lightly anesthetized, sedated state. Animals were pre-instrumented with a Konigsburg micromanometer and a polyvinyl catheter in the LV apex, miniaturized sonomicrometer pairs (3 MHz, 6 mm) across the LV anteroposterior minor axis, a polyvinyl catheter in the right atrium for central venous access, and pacing wires on the right atrial appendage. Wires and tubes were tunneled subcutaneously into the interscapular area for later use. Postoperative pain was reduced by the use of Buprenex (0.01 mg/kg i.m., q 6 h), and postoperative antibiotic (Monocid 25 mg/kg) was administered for 5 days to reduce the risk of infection. Baseline hemodynamic studies were performed after a minimum of 1 week for postoperative recovery.Hemodynamic data acquisition and analysis The micromanometers and fluid-filled catheters were calibrated with a mercury manometer. Zero drift of the micromanometer was corrected by matching the LV enddiastolic pressure measured simultaneously through the LV catheter. The fluid-filled LV catheter was connected to a pre-calibrated Statham 23 dB transducer with zero pressure at the level of the mid right atrium. The transit time of ultrasound between the ultrasonic dimension crystals was measured with a multichannel sonomicrometer (Triton Technology) and converted to distance assuming a constant velocity of sound in blood of 1.55 mm/ms.The analog LV dP/dI signal was obtained online by electronic differentiation of the high-fidelity LV pressure signal. \u03c4 was derived from the highfidelity LV pressure tracing by the method of Weiss et al. (1976) , which assumes a monoexponential decay of LV pressure to a zero asymptote and has been shown to be directionally equivalent to other mathematical approaches for quantification of isovolumic pressure decay. \u03c4 is equal to the time in milliseconds for LV pressure to decay to 1/e; thus, decreases in \u03c4 reflect improved isovolumic ventricular relaxation.Fractional shortening of the LV minor axis was calculated as (EDD-ESD)/EDD, where EDD is LV enddiastolic dimension and ESD is LV end-systolic dimension. LV end-diastole was defined as the time in which LV dP/dt max increased by \u2265 150 mmHg/s for 50 ms, and LV end-systole was defined as the time of the maximum ratio of LV pressure to LV minor-axis dimension. LV volumes were derived from minor-axis diameter (D) measurements: LV volume = \u03c0/6(D) 3 .V cf was calculated as LV fractional shortening divided by LV ejection time; LV ejection time was defined as the time from peak positive to peak negative dP/dt.Analog signals for high-fidelity and fluid-filled LV pressures, LV short-axis dimension, LV dP/dt, and the ECG were recorded on-line on a Gould multichannel recorder at 25 and 100 mm/s paper speed and digitized through an analog-to-digital board (Dual Control Systems) interfaced to an IBM AT computer at 500 Hz and stored on a floppy disk. Data were analyzed using an algorithm and software developed in our laboratory. Steady-state data were acquired over 5-10 s during spontaneous respiration and averaged.",

Again, for this purpose dogs are preferred instead of cats or guinea pigs. The dose to induce cardiac arrest is determined in 3-6 dogs. To other dogs, the same test compound is given intraduodenally at a dose below the intravenous lethal dose. Ninety or 180 min afterwards, the intravenous infusion with the same infusion speed and the same concentration of the test compound as in the previous experiments is started and time until cardiac arrest determined. The higher the duodenal resorption of the compound, the lower the dose of the intravenous infusion will be. For evaluation, the intravenous dose needed in the second experimental series (with enteral predosing) is subtracted from the dose of the first series (without enteral predosing) and indicates the amount of absorbed compound. This value is expressed as percentage of the value of the first series and indicates the absorption rate.The efficacy and safety of a novel Na + ,K + -ATPase inhibitor has been tested in dogs with propranolol-induced heart failure by Maixent et al. (1992) . Hossmann (1982) reviewed the experimental models of cerebral ischemia. Yamamoto et al. (1992) studied the inhibition of NO biosynthesis on the volume of focal ischemic infarction produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Shigeno et al. (1985) described a recirculation model following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. The trunk of the middle cerebral artery was isolated between the rhinocortical branch and the lenticulostriate artery and encircled with a loose-fitting suture of nylon thread. The thread was exteriorized through a small polyethylene catheter, which was previously introduced into the craniectomy site through a burr hole in the zygoma. The artery was occluded by retraction of the thread, which was then fixed with biological glue. Recirculation was achieved by cutting and removing the thread. Bederson et al. (1986a) occluded the middle cerebral artery at different sites in six groups of normal rats and characterized the anatomical sites that produce uniform cerebral infarction. A neurological system was developed that can be used to evaluate the effects of cerebral ischemia. Bederson et al. (1986b) evaluated the use of 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride as a histopathological stain for identification and quantification of infarcted brain tissue after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Yang et al. (1992) found a reduction of Na,K-ATPase activity in the ischemic hemisphere shortly after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Du et al. (1996) induced transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats by a 90 min period of ligation of the right middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries. Germano et al. (1987) found a decrease of stroke size and deficits in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion after treatment with kynurenic acid, a broad spectrum antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors. Wu et al. (1999) reported that propentofylline attenuates microglial reaction in the rat spinal cord induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Gotti et al. (1988) found a reduction of the volume of infarcted tissue due to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats and cats after administration of NMDA receptor antagonists. Hossmann and Schuier (1980) studied experimental brain infarcts in cats after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery.",

(1997) found a reduction of ischemic and excitotoxic neuronal damage by inhibition of interleukin 1\u03b2-converting enzyme family proteases after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice and rats. Nylon filaments were introduced from the carotid artery which were withdrawn after 2 h. One day later, the animals were tested for neurological deficits and the brains analyzed for infarct size and interleukin 1\u03b2 levels. Huang et al. (1994) produced knock-out mice deficient in the neuronal isoform of NO synthase by targeted disruption of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene. In these mice, Hara et al. (1996) found reduced brain edema and infarction volume after transient middle coronary artery occlusion. Nishimura et al. (1998) described an experimental model of thromboembolic stroke without craniotomy in cynomolgus monkeys by delivering an autologous blood clot to the middle cerebral artery. A chronic catheter was implanted in the left carotid artery in male cynomolgus monkeys. A 5 cm long piece of an autologous blood clot was flushed into the internal carotid artery with physiological saline. A neurological score was assigned at 0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after embolization. In the acute phase after embolization, typical behavior consisted of circling gait and moderate deviation towards the side of embolization, long-lasting and strong extensor hypotonia of the contralateral lower and upper limbs, and mild to severe incoordination. Contralateral hemiplegia was observed over the following 24 h. At 24 h the animals were sacrificed immediately after the last neurological scoring, and the cerebral vasculature was inspected for the location of the clot. The brain was then cut into 2 mm thick coronal sections. Cerebral infarction size and location were ascertained by the triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride staining method. The lesions involved mostly the caudate nucleus, internal capsule, putamen and thalamus.",

The main advantages of MRI are its high resolution, non-invasiveness and versatility, which allow comprehensive characterization of a disease state and the effects of drug intervention. Recent advances now allow the application of this technique to the characterization of models of lung inflammation in rats and to the profiling of anti-inflammatory drugs. Repeated measurements can be carried out on the same animal, and time-courses of events can be easily assessed. Furthermore, the prospect of using MRI to detect non-invasively a sustained mucus hypersecretory phenotype induced by endotoxin brings an important new perspective to models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in animals. Importantly, it might be possible to extend the use of this technique to the clinical study of inflammation in the lung and the consequences of drug treatment (Beckmann et al. 2003 (Beckmann et al. , 2004 .Functional magnetic resonance imaging has been developed as pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging for pharmacodynamic assays and to establish brain-penetrating parameters (Leslie and James 2000) . Although the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose is strongly increased during cerebral activity, the cerebral metabolic rate of O 2 is not increased in direct proportion. The result is that the relative uptake of O 2 from blood actually decreases. The veins and capillaries draining from the activated region are \"arterialized\" and their deoxyhemoglobin concentration is reduced. Deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin have different magnetization properties; thus the changes in the ratio of these two entities can be detected by bloodoxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging.

The right superior thyroid, occipital, and pterygopalatine arteries were ligated and cut. A poly-L-lysine-coated 3-0 nylon monofilament with a heat-blunted tip was inserted through the proximal external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery and pushed forward a distance of 19 or 20 mm from the carotid bifurcation, depending on the weight of the rat, so as to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery. After suture placement, the neck incision was closed and the animal was allowed to regain consciousness. Two hours following occlusion of the artery, the rats were tested on a standard neurological battery to confirm the presence of a neurological deficit. Animals that did not exhibit a forelimb flexion were excluded from further study. At this time, the rats were re-anesthetised and the intraluminal suture was completely withdrawn to restore the blood supply.",

The rf coils were decoupled from each other -the transmitter coil actively and the receiver coil passively.Using gradient-echo imaging, sagittal pilot scans were performed to ensure accurate positioning of the animal in the magnet. For this purpose, the coronal plane 5.9 mm posterior to the rhinal fissure was placed in the isocenter of the magnet, thus focusing on the center of the ischemic territory resulting from the middle cerebral artery occlusion.For the determination of the temporal evolution of the ischemic lesion, two NMR imaging modalities were used. A field of view of 3.2 cm, a slice thickness of 1.5 mm, and an interslice distance of 2 mm were used for both sequences. Multislice packages were recorded by placing the center of the multislice imaging packet 5.9 mm posterior to the rhinal fissure.Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using a Stejskal-Tanner spin-echo sequence [echo time (TE) = 37.2 ms, repetition time (TR) = 2325 ms, eight slices] in six rats per group. To enable quantification of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of brain water, three b values were used (b = 50, 825,",

Magnetic resonance imaging was also used to determine the size of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats induced by stereotactic microinfusion of collagenase into the caudate putamen (Elger et al. 1994b ). Reese et al. (2000) visualized regional brain activation by bicucculine by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Time-resolved assessment of bicucculine-induced changes in local cerebral blood volume was achieved using magnetite nanoparticles as an intravascular contrast agent. Pevsner et al. (2001) described a photothrombotic method of acute small stroke induction in rats with histopathologic and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) observations from 3 to 6 h after irradiation, which is homologous to a human autopsy specimen. Utilizing 30 min of irradiation with minimal beam intensity (0.1 W/cm 2 ) cold white light in conjunction with 20 mg of intravenous (i.v.) rose bengal as a rapid infusion, small infarcts were induced photochemically in the frontal lobes of rats.Using in vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, Ohlstein et al. (2000) evaluated the effects of tranilast, an antiallergic drug, on neointima formation following balloon angioplasty of the rat coronary artery. Swain et al. (2003) employed T-two-star (T 2 *)weighted and flow-alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess chronic changes in blood volume and flow as a result of exercise in rats. Prolonged exercise induced angiogenesis and increased cerebral blood flow in primary motor cortex.Using MRI evaluation of brain damage, Banfi et al. (2004) demonstrated that pentoxifylline prevents spontaneous brain ischemia in stroke-prone rats. Henderson et al. (2004) studied functional magnetic resonance imaging during hypotension in young and adult cats.In a magnetic resonance imaging study Shirhan et al. (2004) found that spermine reduces infarction and neurological deficit a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Paczynski et al. (2000) studied the effects of fluid management on edema volume and midline shift in a rat model of ischemic stroke. MRI were obtained 24 h after the onset of ischemia so that the ratio of hemispheric volumes ipsilateral and contralateral to the infarct and the extent of midline shift could be obtained. Cash et al. (2001) evaluated the effectiveness of aminoguanidine as a neuroprotective agent in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion using serial magnetic resonance imaging.The MRI protocol consisted of three interleaved imaging regimens: proton density-weighted imaging (PDWI), T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 WI) and diffusionweighted imaging (DWI). Repetition time (TR) was 3 s for each of the three regimens and echo times (TE) PROCEDURE Male Wistar rats weighing between 250 and 300 g are pre-treated with heparin (1000 units/kg i.v.) and anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p.) The animals are intubated with a tracheal tube and positive pressure ventilation is maintained with a Harvard Rodent Respirator at 4-6 ml/stroke and 50 strokes/min. The right jugular vein is cannulated with polyethylene tubing for administration of drugs.The lumbar sympathetic chain is isolated dorsal to the inferior mesenteric branches via an abdominal midline incision. The aorta is freed from the vena cava and two silk ligatures are placed around the aorta. The aorta is ligated and cannulated proximal as well as distally with polyethylene tubings. A short piece of rubber tubing is inserted at the distal end to allow intraarterial injections of drugs. Two \"T\" junctions allow the measurement of arterial pressure and perfusion pressure by Statham P 23 Db pressure transducers being recorded through a Hellige physiological recorder. From the proximal part of the aorta, blood is forced to its distal part by a peristaltic pump (Desaga) through a glass coil kept at 40\u00b0C. Flow rate is adjusted to produce a stable perfusion pressure as close to the systemic pressure as possible. After initial adjustment, flow rate is not altered for the remainder of the experiment.Following perfusion pressure stabilization, the sympathetic chain is isolated and a small (1 mm wide, 2 mm long) curved bipolar electrode is placed around the nerve for electrical stimulation. Square-wave pulses from a Grass stimulator are used to activate the nerve with a constant current of 2.5 milliamps, supramaximal voltage and varying frequencies of 5 ms duration.A dose-response curve is established for norepinephrine by giving doses of 0.01 \u00b5g, 0.03 \u00b5g, 0.1 \u00b5g, 0.3 \u00b5g, 1.0 \u00b5g, and 3.0 \u00b5g intra-arterially and measuring perfusion pressure changes. Similarly, a frequencyresponse curve to nerve stimulation is established by stimulation at 3 Hz, 6 Hz, and 10 Hz for 30 s. Two predrug readings are taken to insure consistent responses.A minimum of four animals is used for each test compound.",

The abdomen of anesthetized rats is opened and the superior mesenteric artery is separated from surrounding tissue in the region of the aorta. A cannula is inserted into the superior mesenteric artery at its origin from the abdominal aorta. The cannula is filled with heparinized Krebs solution. The ileocoeliac branch of the artery is tied off and the intestine separated from the mesentery by cutting close to the intestinal border of the mesentery. The cannulated artery and its vascular bed are dissected out and mounted in an organ bath. The preparation is perfused with oxygenated Krebs-bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37\u00b0C. Perfusion pressure is recorded via a side arm of the arterial cannula using a Statham pressure transducer. The flow rate is adjusted to give a baseline perfusion pressure of 20-30 mm Hg. The test substances are infused into another side arm of the arterial cannula for 15 s using an infusion pump. After three stimuli with norepinephrine (1 \u00b5g) or potassium chloride (1 mg), the test drugs are infused followed by further stimulation. The inhibition of increase of perfusion pressure after test drugs is expressed as percentage of control. Nuki et al. (1994) compared the vasodilating activity of chicken calcitonin gene-related peptide with human \u03b1-CGRP and rat CGRP in the precontracted mesenteric vascular bed of rats.The rabbit isolated arterially perfused intestinal segment preparation was used by Brown et al.

(1992) measured lung water content in dogs with acute pulmonary hypertension induced by injection of glass beads. Drake et al. (1978) studied filtration characteristics of the exchange vessels in isolated dog lung by calculating the volume conductance with use of different components of the weight-gain curve following changes in capillary pressure. Heaton et al. (1995) studied the effects of human adrenomedullin on the pulmonary vascular bed of isolated, blood perfused rat lung. DeWitt et al. (1994) , Lippton et al. (1994) investigated the effects of adrenomedullin in the pulmonary and systemic vascular bed of the cat. Nossaman et al. (1995) compared the effects of adrenomedullin, an adrenomedullin analog, and CGRP in the pulmonary vascular bed of the cat and the rat.",

To enable drugs to be applied either to the intima or the adventitia, the artery was double cannulated so that the intraluminal and extraluminal perfusion media did not mix. Constrictor responses were measured by the maximum rise in perfusion pressure. Steinsland et al. (1973) studied the inhibition of adrenergic transmission by parasympathicomimetics in the isolated central ear artery of the rabbit. Perfusion was performed at a constant flow rate with Krebs' solution and perfusion pressure was recorded with a transducer. Allen et al.

Several authors described animal models of aneurysms (Carrell et al. 1999; Dobrin 1999; Daugherty and Cassis 2004) . Most studies were performed in mice. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are evoked by genetically defined defects in extracellular matrix maturation, increased degradation of elastin and collagen, aberrant cholesterol homeostasis, or enhanced production of angiotensin peptides.The Blotchy mouse has an X-linked trait that leads to aortic aneurysms and subsequent fatal rupture in nearly all affected male mice (Brophy et al. 1988; Reilly et al. 1990 ).

(2002) showed that inactivation of the lysyl oxidase gene Lox leads to aortic aneurysms, cardiovascular dysfunction, and perinatal death in mice.Aneurysm development has been noted in a number of mice with deficiencies in the components of the matrix metalloproteinase system (Silence et al. 2001 (Silence et al. , 2002 .The use of mice in atherosclerosis research was escalated by the development of mice that are deficient in either apoE or LDL receptors susceptible to aneurysm development (Ishibashi et al. 1994; Prescott et al. 1999) .Accelerated atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysms formation, and ischemic heart disease were found in apolipoprotein E and endothelial nitric oxide synthase double-knockout mice (Kuhlencordt et al. 2001) . ACE inhibition reduces some symptoms of vascular pathology in apoE and eNOS compound-deficient mice . Mice with deficiency of the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) showed pathological changes in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta with substantial lengthening, dilatation, thickening and large aneurysms (Herz and Strickland 2001; Boucher et al. 2003) .Salt-sensitive aortic aneurysms and rupture in hypertensive transgenic mice that overproduce angiotensin II were described by Nishijo et al. (1998) .The infusion of elastase into the infrarenal segment has been used as model for abdominal aorta aneurysms in rats (Anidjar et al. 1990 ) and mice (Pyo et al. 2000) . Lee et al. (2001) described abdominal aortic aneu rysms in mice lacking expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase.Periarterial application of calcium chloride was used to induce aneurysms of the rabbit common carotid artery (Gertz et al. 1988 ) and in the rabbit aorta (Freestone et al. 1997) .This technique has been used in mice by Chiou et al. (2001) and Longo et al. (2002) . Nomoto et al. (2003) described the effects of two inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system on attenuation of postoperative remodeling after left ventricular aneurysm repair in rats.",

The adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or by the immunohistochemical method. To identify macrophages in the aortic wall, a purified rat anti-mouse Mac-3 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) was used for immunochemistry staining (PhenoPath Laboratories). To localize cells undergoing nuclear DNA fragmentation, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was performed using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Roche Biochemicals) (Song et al. 2000; Feng et al. 2002) . Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were then washed with PBS and incubated with proteinase K (20 \u00b5g/ml) for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature. TdT, which catalyzes a template-independent addition of deoxyribonucleotide to 3-OH ends of DNA, was used to incorporate digoxigenin-conjugated dUTP to the ends of DNA fragment in situ. The TUNEL signal was then detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with peroxidase and developed with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and cleared before coverslips were placed. Both positive and negative control slides were processed at the same time in each experiment. The presence of apoptotic cells was scored as nuclear staining, with a distinctive morphological appearance associated with cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation.",

            "text": "Regulation of new blood vessel formation, angiogenesis, is precisely programmed throughout the lifetime of vertebrates. Besides the role of angiogenesis in normal function, it is an essential component of disease processes, including tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and diabetic retinopathy (Folkman and Klagsbrun 1987; Klagsbrun and D'Amore 1991; Folkman and Shing 1992) . Multiple factors that stimulate angiogenesis either directly or indirectly have been described, including the fibroblast growth factor family (Esch et al. 1985) , vascular endothelial growth factor (Leung et al. 1990; Thomas 1996; Ferrara and Davis-Smyth 1997) , epidermal growth factor (Gospadarowicz et al. 1979) , transforming growth factor-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (Schreiber et a 1986; Yang and Moses 1990) , tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (Leibovich et al. 1987) , angiogenin (Fett et al. 1985) , CYR61, a product of a growth factorinducible immediate early gene ect.The pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis is of considerable interest in the development of new therapeutic modalities for the treatment of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis, hemangiomas, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, in which pathological angiogenesis occurs (Ezekowitz et al. 1992; Folkman and Shing 1992; Fan and Brem 1992; O'Brien et al. 1994) . Several natural inhibitors of angiogenesis were described, such as thrombospondin (Good et al. 1990 ), somatostatin , angiostatin, isolated from a subclone of Lewis lung carcinoma, (O'Reilly et al. 1994 (O'Reilly et al. , 1996 , endostatin, a 20 kDa angiogenesis inhibitor from a murine hemangioendothelioma which is a C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII (O' Reilly et al. 1997; Dhanabal et al. 1999) , vasostatin .Angiogenesis was studied ex vivo by culturing rat or mouse aortic rings in collagen gel (Zhu et al. 2003) . Unlike rat aorta explants, unstimulated mouse aortic rings were unable to spontaneously produce an angiogenic response under serum-free conditions. They, however, responded to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), generating networks of branching neovessels. Couffinhal et al. (1998) published a mouse model of angiogenesis. The femoral artery of one hind-limb was ligated and excised. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging was employed to document the consequent reduction in hind-limb blood-flow, which typically persisted for up to 7 days. Neovascularization was shown to develop in association with augmented expression of VEGF mRNA and protein from skeletal myocytes as well as endothelial cells from the ischemic hind-limb.",

Corneal blood vessels are induced by basic fibroblast growth factor which is applied in carrier pellets. These pellets are produced by dispersing 50 \u00b5l of 2% methylcellulose containing 500 ng human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor diluted in 10 \u00b5l phosphate-buffered saline in plastic rods with a diameter of 4 mm. Dried pellets are folded twice and implanted intrastromally in the 12 o'clock position into a corneal tunnel. This tunnel is created by a central cut of approximately 50% depth and extended into the peripheral cornea to a point 2.0 mm away from the limbus. Following implantation, the central entrance of the tunnel is closed with a single 10-0 nylon suture in order to ensure that the tear film does not dissolve the pellet and uncontrolled liberation of the growth factor is prevented.The test substance is dissolved in a viscous gel containing 0.002% polyacrylic acid, 0.04% sorbitol, and 0.001% cetrimide in a watery base. The eyes are treated once daily with 0.1 ml of this gel which is applied in the lower conjunctiva sac. The eyes are closed for several seconds to avoid loss of the substance. Each animal's contralateral eye receives gel without test substance and serves as control. Control animals receive the viscous gel without test substance.Animals are observed daily under an operating microscope, and vascular growth is documented on days 6, 9, 12, and 16 after surgery. The number of blood vessels, their length and the dimension of the vascularized area are quantified with a caliper under the operating microscope as well as on standardized photographs. On every observation day corneas are stained with fluorescein in order to show epithelial irregularities due to the topical treatment.",

(1997) characterized the neovascularization that follows the intracorneal injection of bovine albumin in rabbits as a model of angiogenesis. New Zealand white rabbits received intracorneal injections of phosphate buffered saline with and without various amounts of bovine albumin. The rabbits were co-sensitized or pre-sensitized by intramuscular bovine albumin. The corneal response was quantified by ranking photographs taken periodically after the injection. Babic et al. (1998) tested an angiogenesis promotor in the corneal pocket angiogenesis assay in rats. studied inhibitors of angiogenesis in the corneal angiogenesis assay in rats. A 1.5 mm incision was made approximately 1 mm from the center of the cornea in anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. Using a curved spatula, the incision was bluntly dissected through the stroma toward the outer canthus of the eye. A hydron pellet (2 \u00d7 20 mm) containing 200 ng vascular endothelial growth factor and 100 ng sucralfrate was inserted into the base of the pocket. Foschi et al. (1994) , , studied neovascularization of rat cornea induced by chemical injury. Both eyes of ether-anesthetized rats were cauterized by applying a AgNO 3 / KNO 3 (1:1, w/w) applicator to the surface of the cornea eccentrically at a point approximately 2 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. Rats were treated 4 times daily for 6 days with eye drops. The eyes were examined by slit-lamp microscopy daily for 6 days to the evaluate the growth of the vessels. On the 6th day after cauterization, the rats were anesthetized and the upper body perfused through a cannula inserted in the ascending aorta with Ringer's solution until the normal pink color of the fundi disappeared and then with a mixture of 10% India ink/6% gelatin in Ringer's solution. The eyes were enucleated and placed in 4% formaldehyde. The cornea and a 1 mm rim of adjacent scleral tissue were dissected from the rest of the globe and three full thickness peripheral radial cuts were made to allow flattening of the cornea. The corneas were then placed on a glass slide in mounting media, magnified, and photographed. The area occupied by blood vessels was calculated and the area vascularization of drug treated animals was compared to that of control rats. Kenyon et al. (1996) , performed the corneal micropocket assay in mice.",
