DS patients received risk-stratified therapy with additional supportive care guidelines, including leucovorin rescue after intrathecal methotrexate until maintenance, and highly encouraged hospitalizations during high-risk blocks until neutrophil recovery. SR-Av patients underwent a 2 \u00d7 2 randomization at end-IND to standard (SC) vs. intensified consolidation (IC) and standard interim maintenance (IM)/delayed intensification (DI) vs. intensified IM/DI. The IM/DI randomization was closed in 2008 due to superior results of escalating IV methotrexate (MTX) during IM for SR ALL patients treated on CCG 1991; all patients enrolled in AALL0331 subsequently received escalating IV MTX during IM. SR-high DS patients nonrandomly received IC and a single intensified IM/DI vs double IM/DI given to non-DS patients. SR-Low DS and non-DS patients participated in a randomization to additional pegaspargase doses during consolidation and IM.",

There was no difference in the proportion of patients with a rapid early response or slow early response between DS and non-DS patients (p = 0.578). Risk distribution was significantly different (p<0.0001) for DS vs non-DS patients: SR-Low (15% vs. 47.3%), SR-Av (66.7% vs. 36.9%), and SR-High (18% vs. 15.8%).

High mutation rates in tumors can have twofold effect; 1) a large number of non-synonymous mutations that have no role as drivers can still cause functional tumor antigens increasing the neoantigen burden and immunogenicity. Moreover, 2) such tumors can gain mutations in canonical or non-canonical DNA repair pathways leading to a gain in the number of mutations as seen in case of glioblastoma, this can lead to even higher accelerated mutational rate. Evidences suggest that high mutational load can cause higher neoantigen burden thereby making the tumor more susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibition.

To directly determine the importance of thrombinmediated fibrin polymerization in metastasis, we analyzed metastatic potential in FibAEK mice, which carry a form of fibrinogen essentially \"locked\" in the soluble state due to a mutation in the A chain thrombin cleavage site. Metastatic potential in FibAEK mice was diminished relative to control mice, speaking to the importance of thrombin-mediated fibrin polymerization in the metastatic process.

These studies show that thrombin-mediated fibrin polymerization promotes metastasis, but soluble fibrinogen retains some significant prometastatic capacity. Surprisingly, loss of the fibrinogen chain IIb 3 binding motif had no impact on metastasis. Given the established importance of platelets in metastasis, these findings suggest that fibrin (ogen) is capable of platelet stabilization through mechanism(s) independent of this IIb 3 binding motif.

Platelets participate in the innate immune system through direct antimicrobial activity and interactions with effector cells (Chapman2012, Garlanda2013, Kapur 2016). In the adaptive immune system, platelets recruit and costimulate T-cells, and promote B-cell differentiation and antibody class switching (Kapur2016, Morrell2017). The question remains: which mechanisms influence platelet immune function and are they developmentally regulated? Preliminary studies in the Palis lab have revealed significant dif-ferences in embryonic versus adult platelet gene expression, including regulators of immune and inflammatory responses such as Beta2-microglobulin (B2M) and Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC1). MHC1 is expressed on all cell surfaces except red blood cells and its molecular chaperone B2M is a marker of inflammation highly expressed in platelet alpha granules (Zufferey2014). Preliminary data from the Morrell lab reveals a mass release of B2M during platelet activation, which drives monocyte differentiation to an inflammatory phenotype through TGFB receptor signaling. We therefore sought to determine whether developmental changes in platelet B2M expression mediate differences in platelet-mediated monocyte activation.",

CT revealed a paraspinal mass that was MIBG-avid on further study, strongly suggesting neuroblastoma. Bone marrow was normocellular and negative for malignancy, however revealed marked granulocytic hypoplasia and maturation arrest concerning for severe congenital or, less likely, immune-mediated neutropenia. Metastatic workup was negative. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous variant of unknown significance (c. 668T>C) in the HELLS gene, portending a working diagnosis of ICF4 syndrome. Immunoglobulin supplementation, pentamidine prophylaxis, and G-CSF were initiated. He was able discontinue G-CSF after 4 months of treatment. His neuroblastoma, initially categorized as L1, met criteria for observation. However, followup MRI revealed interval growth nearing the spinal canal. He underwent tumor resection, confirming MYCN non-amplified, favorable histology neuroblastoma. After infectious prophylaxis and immunologic support were initiated, he incurred two other hospitalizations, the first for G-tube cellulitis and the second for parainfluenza respiratory illness. He now has stable neutrophil counts off G-CSF and remains in remission from neuroblastoma. Current plan is to proceed with bone marrow transplantation for immunodeficiency.",

Background: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a rare malignancy that arises from exocrine glands in the upper aerodigestive tract and tracheobronchial tree. Conventionally, MEC diagnosis is based on histology, with prognosis based on the extent of resection and detection of metastases. MEC is characterized by a translocation of chromosomes 11q and 19p resulting in a fusion between the MECT1 and MAML2 genes, that occurs in 38-81% of cases. This fusion transcript has been recognized to have a favorable impact on disease features and prognosis of MEC. However, recent studies indicate that high grade MEC can have MECT1-MAML2 fusion positivity and multiple other genomic imbalances that have not been studied in much detail. Owing to the rarity of MEC tumors, more definitive data related to the clinical and prognostic significance of these molecular markers are limited.",

History of organ or bone marrow transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, and primary or acquired immunodeficiency syndromes increases the risk of EBVassociated tumors. Epstein-Barr virus associated smooth muscle tumors (EBV-SMT) are unique and rare neoplasms typically discovered in immunocompromised patients. Most information related to pathogenesis and therapeutic options is limited to case reports and case series of adult patients. There are several gene expression pathways that EBV utilizes, the most notable of which is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The mTOR pathway performs a key role through integrating various cell growth signals and factors to regulate protein synthesis and metabolism related to smooth muscle proliferation. Sirolimus is an immune modulating therapy that targets the mTOR pathway to block activation of lymphocytes.",

It is increasingly clear that the PAX-FOXO1 fusion status is an important poor prognostic factor, thus the histological classification tends to be replaced by the fusion status, particularly in terms of risk stratifica-tion In contrast to ARMS, there are no recurrent chromosome alterations in ERMS; however, there are multiple numerical chromosome changes that are frequent in these tumours: gain of chromosome 2,8, 12 and 13 have been found in 25 to 50 % of EMRS karyotypes. Moreover, ERMS tumors show frequently allelic loss, the 11.p15.5 chromosomal region being the most frequently involved. Recently, novel gene fusions have been described also in ERMS tumours. These fusions involved mainly the NCOA2 and or the VGGL2 genes. The rearrangement partners are variable, and include, i.e. PAX 3 (2q35), SRF (8q11) and TEAD 1 (11p15).",

Background: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Classically, medulloblastoma presents as a well-defined mass lesion in the cerebellum, with a high rate of metastatic dissemination. Primary leptomeningeal medulloblastoma (PLMB) is an exceedingly rare type of medulloblastoma presentation with a dismal prognosis in which patients present with isolated leptomeningeal disease without an associated mass. To our knowledge, only three pediatric and three adult cases of PLMB (ages 5 -30 years) have been reported, all of which died within 6 months of diagnosis. This is the first case of PLMB to report a molecular classification.",

Cure is achieved in the majority of cases with surgical resection, however treatment for unresectable cases remains an enigma. Recently published literature postulates that the newly discovered BCOR duplication found in PMMTI is tumorigenic via an epigenetic pathway. This molecular signature resembles that of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and the growing number of BCOR mutated sarcomas.

She underwent placement of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNgIUD) and began norethindrone. Her HMB continued despite the LNgIUD and an increase in norethindrone dosing. Plasma derived AHF/VWF complex was administered, which she had previously received. Following the infusion, the patient developed anaphylaxis with hives, wheezing, tachycardia, and itching requiring 2 doses of diphenhydramine and 1 dose of hydrocortisone with resolution of symptoms. Subsequently, she received recombinant VWF without incident. However, due to her low FVIII level, she also required treatment with a full length recombinant FVIII product. She again developed hives and itching after this infusion. She has since received recombinant VWF with recombinant FVIII/Fc fusion protein without further allergic reaction. There was no evidence of an inhibitor with her most recent post-infusion VWF level was 101%, factor VIII 199%.",

It is unclear in this patient's case to which aspect of her treatment she is allergic, as she reacted to plasma-derived AHF/VWF and full length recombinant FVIII, but not recombinant VWF or recombinant FVIII/Fc fusion protein.

The Hb variant ran in the D zone, a pattern consistent with mother's Hb. Alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis banding pattern showed F/S. Acid agarose gel electrophoresis pattern showed V/F. Later testing revealed abnormal isopropanol stability with 3+ precipitation at 20 minutes. This electrophoresis pattern is consistent with the pattern previously reported of Hb Khartoum.

She has not had any hemolytic episodes, and her bilirubin levels have always been within the normal range Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case of Hb Khartoum/ thalassemia. The proline to arginine substitution of Hb Khartoum introduces a charged group on the chain at the site of 1 1 contact. The resulting unstable 1 1 chains can dissociate into monomers and favor the formation of methemoglobin, leading to hemoglobin instability. We had wondered if this unstable hemoglobin might result in clinical hemolysis when challenged with oxidative stress, such as in periods of infection. However, in the two years we have followed this patient, she has never had a hemolytic episode. At two years of age, she has HbF 7.8%, Hb Khartoum 85.5%, and HbA2 6.7%.

His 3-month follow-up scans demonstrated relapse and he was subsequently treated with additional chemotherapy, surgical resection, and MIBG therapy, Crizotinib for an EML4-ALK fusion and finally Ifosfamide, Carboplatin and Etoposide (ICE). He developed neutropenic fevers and was started on Cefepime, Vancomycin and Fluconazole. Blood cultures were initially negative. On the 4th day of fever, his previously scheduled PET scan was performed during hospitalization and showed new pulmonary opacities. He did not have respiratory symptoms, but therapy was escalated to Meropenem, Vancomycin and Amphotericin. Emergent bronchoscopy was performed the same day, with all bacterial and fungal cultures remaining negative. Overnight, he developed tachypnea and saturations in the upper 80s, requiring nasal cannula. IR-guided lung biopsy was performed the next day, a flexible bronchoscopy was done to remove blood clots in the airway, the patient was placed on a ventilator, femoral lines were placed, granulocytes ordered and pressors were started for deterioration to presumed septic shock. Arterial and femoral lines were placed but patient continued to have hemodynamic instability on multiple pressors. The following day, blood and respiratory cultures returned positive for Results: At 33 days after the start of ITI, the inhibitor was <0.1 BU and continued undetectable 6 months after initiation of ITI therapy. In this patient, ITI with high-dose plasma-derived factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) complex was well tolerated and effective. Genetic analysis confirmed a large factor VIII gene duplication of exons 7 to 22. We believe our patient developed inhibitor so quickly (14 exposure days) due to the possibility of this mutation causing a frameshift that introduces a premature termination codon. This might be functionally similar to a deletion in the factor VIII gene which poses the highest risk for inhibitor development in patients with severe hemophilia A. This variant has only been identified previously in two unrelated patients diagnosed with severe hemophilia A. This duplication is not listed in dbSNP variant database, nor observed in the general population database.",

Suppression of the neutrophil count is used to demonstrate adequate dosing of 6-MP during this phase of therapy. Bone marrow suppression is mediated by the active metabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TGN), whereas the metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MMPN) has been shown to cause hepatotoxicity. Allopurinol has been used infrequently in ALL maintenance therapy in the setting of skewed metabolism when adequate myelosuppression is difficult to achieve due to excessive hepatic toxicity. When given in combination with allopurinol a reduced dose of 6-MP may result in both increased 6-TGN levels and decreased 6-MMPN levels.",

High titer inhibitors render treatment with factor VIII ineffective, necessitating the use of bypass agents that may not achieve hemostasis with the same efficacy. Considering the substantial ramifications of inhibitor development on treatment, eradication of inhibitors is of great importance to achieve adequate hemostasis in this patient population.

He underwent tolerization to rituximab, and received a six month course with a partial response (nadir of 0.56 BU). 12 months following last dose of rituximab, a rising inhibitor titer (7.44 BU) was found. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was initiated with subsequent inhibitor stabilization and a decreasing titer (1.48 BU) over the course of the following year.

Somatic mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor GATA1 in DS AML patients are responsible for the observed hypersensitivity of DS AML blasts to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). In view of excellent survival rates (approaching 90%) of DS AML patients, the ongoing Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML1531 study seeks to determine the feasibility of treating standard risk (minimal residual disease/MRD negative) DS AML patients using a reduced dose (7-fold decrease) ara-C backbone. Although results from Japanese trials with this approach are promising, North American and European data are conflicting. Although chromosome 7 rearrangements in DS AML do not appear to carry the same adverse prognostic significance as in non-DS AML, monosomy 7 in DS AML patients has been associated with a moderately worse outcome. Isochromosome 7q, however, is rare and has only been reported in 3 previous cases of DS AML.",

By the start of maintenance she had received many more PRBC transfusions than the average patient. Intermittent drops in hemoglobin (Hb) did not correlate with any particular agent, and she had stable, mild splenomegaly. A clear pattern emerged during maintenance. Her Hb was 8-9 g/dL at monthly clinic visits, when she received VCR, intermittent intrathecal methotrexate, and corticosteroids.

Background: Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare form of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis that develops specifically in patients with type 1 plasminogen deficiency. Lack of plasmin activity in those patients result in defective fibrinolysis and formation of fibrin-rich membranous material/ masses that develops on the palpebral conjunctiva as well as other sites in the body.Current management involve surgical excision of the masses that is usually complicated by multiple recurrences. Recently, use of topical plasminogen concentrates helped delaying recurrence, but currently, those concentrates are not commercially available.

Although half-life of plasminogen is known to be 2-2.5 days, the patient seemed to have a high catabolic rate after receiv-ing cryoprecipitate, with plasminogen levels reaching basal levels within 4 hours. Because of the better recovery profile with FFP, we opted to give FFP before and after surgery. Peri-operative management included FFP transfusion at 20 ml/kg/12 hours one day before and for 3 days post operatively, followed by 10 ml/kg once daily from day 4-6, then 20 ml/kg on 7th post-operative day. Topical treatment was initiated using antibiotic and steroids ED on the day of surgery, followed by Heparin ED on the second day.

Background: Ponatinib (Inclusig\u00ae, ARIAD pharmaceutical) is a 3rd generation multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for treatment of adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosomepositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) resistant to or intolerant of other TKIs. Ponatinib has numerous drug-drug interactions and a black box warning for associated serious adverse vascular events and hepatotoxicity. For this reason, ponatinib use has been confined to specific high-risk populations. However, in patients who prove refractory to other therapies, the potential benefits of ponatinib may outweigh risks. To date, ponatinib has not been studied in the pediatric/adolescent and young adult (AYA) population.

Patients are likely to benefit from early genetic testing while receiving supportive therapy. WES can highlight syndromes and provide information on recurrence risk for families. The renal and hearing abnormalities are indistinguishable between Epstein and Fechtner's syndromes, but the pathogenic variants differ (2). The genotype-phenotype correlation implies that our patient may have either syndrome, although clinical features compatible with nephritis have yet to manifest. Patients should be monitored closely for long-term progression of MYH9 disease, and treatments should be initiated accordingly. We present an 11-year old female evaluated by genetics at birth due to prenatal microcephaly. Chromosomes and microarray were normal. At age 3 she developed standard risk pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). She completed treatment in 2012 and has been doing well in the interim, remaining in complete clinical remission. During and after treatment she exhibited developmental delay and neurocognitive deficits. At age 11 her height and weight were at or below the 5th centile and head circumference was below the 2nd centile (approximately 6 standard deviations below the mean and corresponding to the 50th centile for a 9-month-old girl). Bone age was appropriate. She had a distinctive triangular face with micrognathia and a pointed nose resembling a Seckel-like syndrome. The patient also had clinodactyly of the 4th toes, zygodactylous triradius involving the 2nd and 3rd left toes, tendency to Sydney line in the right palm and a radial loop in the left middle finger.",

Aberrant expression of protocadherins has been associated with the development of malignancies in many organ systems. With regards to leukemia, the methylation status of this gene at diagnosis has been implicated in the prognosis of ALL and could be used as a biomarker to predict relapse. This patient's de novo mutation and clinical presentation are unique to what has been previously presented in the literature. We feel that this mutation is a clinically significant finding that may shed light on the role of this gene in the development of hematopoeitic malignancies.

The most common abnormality is the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene. Other less common abnormalities include fusion genes KIF5B-PDGFRA and ETV6-PDGFRB and point mutations in PDGFRA22. Some features of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include absolute eosinophilia, splenomegaly, elevated Vitamin B12 and tryptase levels, and organ damage from eosinophil infiltrates and cytokine release. Patients with rearrangements or mutations involving PDGFRA are usually very responsive to Imatinib. Starting doses have not been well studied or established. Experts recommend co-administration of corticosteroids during the first few days of Imatinib therapy in patients with a history of cardiac involvement and/or elevated serum troponin levels to prevent myocardial necrosis, a rare complication of Imatinib therapy in eosinophilic patients. Fortunately our patient did not have cardiac involvement and to date has not exhibited signs of chronic TKI toxicity. Conclusion: Myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia constitute a rare form of chronic leukemias.

Repetitive episodes of hemarthrosis can lead to debilitating hemophilic arthropathy. Lyme disease is a tick-born infection which is endemic to increasing parts of the United States. Chronic Lyme disease, the phase in which Lyme arthritis typically develops, occurs months to years after initial infection and is characterized by swelling of one or more large joints generally in the absence of systemic symptoms.",

Factor replacement regimens included twice daily standard half-life recombinant factor VIII products or daily to every other day extended half-life recombinant factor VIII products with trough levels aimed as high as 50-80%. Factor VIII PK studies were obtained for dosing, to confirm adherence, and to evaluate for subclinical inhibitors (inhibitor testing was negative). Given protracted symptoms additional workup for hemarthrosis was pursed. Lyme titers were positive for (8)IgG, though negative for IgM. He was treated with 28 days of doxycycline during which time hemarthrosis greatly improved on examination and imaging, and he was able to recover function through physical therapy. Second, we report a 6 year-old male with moderate hemophilia B who required multiple hospital admissions for a provoked knee hemarthro-sis with no improvement in symptoms despite weeks of daily or twice daily factor replacement with standard halflife recombinant factor IX products aiming for 100% correction. We performed inhibitor testing (which was negative) and PK studies to assess for non-detectable inhibitors, dosing and adherence. Lyme testing was positive for (6)IgG, though negative for IgM. He was treated with amoxicillin for 28 days during which time hemarthrosis significantly improved on examination and imaging. Diagnosis and follow-up imaging studies for both patients included MRI and serial bedside ultrasounds performed as per UC San Diego School of Medicine MSKUS guidelines. Background: Relapse/refractory AML following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) holds a high mortality rate. Current relapse/refractory therapy modalities for younger patients may include re-induction with a clofarabinebased regimen followed by second allogeneic HSCT. Even for patients who undergo second HSCT, the five-year survival rate is dismal. New therapies, including small molecule inhibitors, are being studied in the post-HSCT relapse setting or those unfit for HSCT with promising results.

He achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative systemic remission, but during his fifth cycle developed bilateral periorbital masses. Biopsies confirmed CD19-negative isolated EM relapsed disease, which was treated with radiation therapy (RT). There was notable resolution of EM disease and he continued systemic therapy. Subsequently, he presented with a painful left scapular swelling. Imaging showed muscle and lung parenchymal EM relapse with CD19-positivity confirmed on histology. He continued on blinatumomab with localized RT while awaiting CAR-T cell therapy. His BM MRD remained negative until he developed systemic MRD-positivity with CD19-positive blasts following the sixth cycle. Primary resistance to blinatumomab is poorly understood. It is proposed that expansion of CD19-negative clones or downregulation of CD19 following blinatumomab may play a role. This was observed in our patient's periorbital relapse; but subsequent EM and systemic relapses were CD19-positive, consistent with the co-existence of multiple clones in relapsed ALL. It has also been postulated that EM relapse could be linked to the failure of blinatumomab or T cells to migrate to EM sites of disease or drug inactivation by the microenvironment. The second EM relapse in our patient, with CD19-positive disease suggests this as a possible mechanism of relapse. This was reported in patients with CD19 positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), and higher doses of blinatumomab however, have shown promising results in this population.",

Initial liver biopsy revealed mild portal fibrous expansion, and abundant hepatic iron deposition. His ferritin continued to increase, peaking at 21,114 ng/ml, along with liver enzymes peaking at an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 505 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 776 U/L. FerriScan showed an elevated estimated liver concentration of 2.8 mg/g dry tissue. Repeat liver biopsy 3 months later showed giant cell hepatitis with worsening mild portal fibrosis and hemosiderosis. Additionally, tissue liver iron concentration was 4755 mcg/g dry weight. Cardiac T2* MRI revealed mild cardiac iron deposition. Given his significant degree of iron overload, Deferoxamine was used to reduce hemosiderosis and liver morbidity in preparation for bone marrow transplantation.",

He received Vincristine and Carboplatin, followed by transition to Vinblastine given new thoracic metastatic lesions after 10 months of therapy. At 15 months after diagnosis, scans were concerning for diffuse leptomeningeal progressive disease and new intracranial lesions, necessitating craniospinal radiation.

A CT scan revealed peri-renal and perirectal soft tissue masses, confirmed by exploratory laparotomy to be peritoneal tumor dissemination of high grade neuroepithelial tumor. A KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was noted and confirmed by RT-PCR, identical to that seen in the original CNS tumors. Additional findings included deletion of chromosome 1p (without 19q loss) and heterozygous and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A found by FISH. Brisk mitotic activity justified a high-grade designation. Salvage chemotherapy consisted of 4 cycles of ICE with subsequent resolution of PET-avid disease and only minimal peri-nephric tissue remaining.

The detection of multiple other subcutaneous nodules on exam raised the concern for malignancy and she was admitted for evaluation. She had two subcutaneous masses on her abdomen, with more cutaneous masses on her legs, back, shoulder, cheek and submandibular areas. She lacked spontaneous lower limb movement and had bilateral clonus. Imaging confirmed multiple masses throughout the body including paravertebral area from T3 to L2, bilateral adrenal glands, left kidney and muscles of upper and lower extremities. Initial differential included neuroblastoma, infantile myofibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma or atypical presentation of a renal tumor. However, synaptophysin and chromogranin stains were negative. With standard immunohistochemistry, the tumor could be only broadly classified as \"undifferentiated sarcoma\" maintaining the diagnostic challenge. Using RT-PCR in the setting of a morphologically primitive round cell neoplasm with strong BCOR expression, two external institutes simultaneously diagnosed the tumor as BCOR-URCS. The primary lesion is unknown but potentially may have arose from the kidney. BCOR-URCS has a heterogeneous histology with tumor cells appearing monomorphic in nests of 6-10 cells separated by septa with uniform nuclei. There is frequently an \"orphan Annie eye\" appearance and sparse cytoplasm to the cells. Diagnosis cannot be made solely on evaluation of this nonspecific histology. RT-PCR uses the genetic abnormality in undifferentiated sarcomas to narrow the differential and BCOR immunohistochemical staining provides further context. BCOR has significant diagnostic value given its sensitivity and specificity in URCS.

Due to progression of disease multiple chemotherapy regimens were tried including Topotecan and Cyclophosphamide, protocol ADVL 1522 with Lorvotuzumab, and Pazopanib. Imaging of the chest continued to show significant progression of metastasis. The patient's clinical status deteriorated with worsening respiratory status, requiring 10L of oxygen therapy, and inability to ambulate. He was started on Trabectedin 1.2mg/m2 for palliative care. After 2 cycles of treatment patient was no longer requiring oxygen and was ambulating without assistance. Radiological imaging showed significant reduction in number and size of lung nodules.",

Candidate somatic driver mutations included TP53 S94X and R248W as well as KIT N655K. Both genes have been previously implicated in thymic carcinoma. RNA expression analysis demonstrated aberrant activation of biological pathways, including overexpression of KIT, HDAC1, 2 and 9, TYMS, and DHFR. The molecular tumor board selected the combination of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle, imatinib (400 mg daily), and vorinostat (400 mg days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19) . On Day 8 of Cycle 1, he was admitted with a herpes zoster infection and imatinib was discontinued in order to reduce risk of herpes zoster recurrence. Imaging after 2 cycles showed a complete metabolic response on F-18 FDG PET and a partial response by CT size criteria. As of December 2017, the patient had received 15 cycles of pemetrexed and vorinostat. Scans in December 2017 showed an increase in the size and metabolic activity of two right lower lobe pulmonary nodules. There were no new sites of disease and imatinib was re-started. Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems and is associated with many different autoantibodies. Patients can present with vague constitutional symptoms including fever, rash, fatigue, and weight loss. Some of the various hematologic manifestations of SLE include anemia of chronic disease, leukopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). These can be the presenting signs of SLE. Evans syndrome (ES), a disease characterized by ITP and AIHA, is a rare hematologic manifestation of SLE. Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a relatively common neurocutaneous disorder. These patients are at risk of developing benign and malignant tumors. Its association with autoimmune disorders, including SLE, remains rare.",

Affected children had mild to moderate bleeding symptoms and required platelet and red cell transfusions. None showed evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis, and all were negative for mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR. SNP genotyping identified multiple statistically non-significant genomic loci, including the region of the major histocompatibility locus (MHC) on chromosome 6p (LOD = 2.01). We focused on this region because affected individuals in two families shared a common homozygous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type and had congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) mutation; the CYP21A2 and HLA loci are located at 6p21.33 and 6p21.32-6p22.1. WES revealed homozygous frameshift mutations in the megakaryocyte and platelet inhibitory receptor G6b-B, encoded within the candidate linkage region. We identified two distinct G6b-B frameshift mutations (c.61_61+1dup; p.20fs and c.147insT; p.49fs) in 7 individuals within these three families. No other mutations that segregated with the phenotype were identified. To validate G6b-B as a potential disease-causing gene, we evaluated G6b-B expression in BM biopsy specimens from affected patient and control samples by immunohistochemical staining using a monoclonal antibody. G6b-B was strongly S83 of S301 and selectively expressed in megakaryocytes of control samples, but completely absent in clinically affected individuals.

When combination therapy is required deferoxamine may be added to oral chelation. Deferoxamine is generally given subcutaneous over 8-12 hours for 5-6 days a week at 25-60mg/kg/day.

Prior reports of short-term HD deferoxamine have shown minimal side effects however, prolonged use of HD deferoxamine has known toxicity.

Short-term HD deferoxamine may be considered in the setting of poor compliance of subcutaneous administration or inadequate chelation with single agent therapy. Further studies are needed to clarify ideal dosing, timing and risk of toxicity. Background: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common cause of symptomatic thrombocytopenia in childhood but remains a diagnosis of exclusion warranting further evaluation if atypical findings are present. Two male children (15 months and 3 years old) with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) were found on initial evaluation to have persistent elevations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). These serum enzyme abnormalities cannot be attributed to ITP. In the setting of thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases and LDH create diagnostic complexity for the hematology/oncology provider as their elevation raises concern for malignancy, hemolytic disease, and other systemic diseases.",

The biggest improvements resulted from making pharmacy calls before patient/family calls, shipping liquid HU to outlying patients, and tracking call time/content. The QI goal was 75 % HU adherence by 12/2017. The 33% baseline adherence rate increased to 80% by 12/2016, and has remained in that range. The completion rate of patient/parent phone calls increased from 33% the first month to 77% at six months. Pharmacy prescription pick-up has increased from 50 % to 77% per month. Lack of liquid HU availability was overcome by shipping the medication to the patient's home. Parental hesitance to share information by phone, especially with QI team members with whom they had no established relationship, was overcome by having the longtime sickle cell nurse do many of the early calls. However, survey feedback showed families became comfortable with several clinic personnel calling. The calls gave families the opportunity to ask questions about their child and/or get additional information about SCD. The calls also provided an opportunity for seasonal flu shot or TCD testing reminders. The surveys gave information on the optimal time of day to reach each family, providing individualization and further increasing the percentage of completed calls. Two families surveyed said they no longer needed two calls a month because they were now able to remember to pick up HU, administer it, and get labs on their own.",

Background: Similar to patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemias (TDT-beta), survivors of hemoglobin Barts hydrops fetalis (homozygous alpha-0-thalassemia, TDTalpha) will require lifelong transfusions of erythrocytes. We have previously shown that a transfusion strategy that is based on the guidelines developed for TDT-beta (conventional transfusion) is suboptimal for these patients owing to the differences in the pathophysiology of anemia in the two conditions: in TDT-alpha, conventional transfusion strategy will lead to a gradual increase in non-functional HbH with subsequent tissue hypoxia and hemolysis. An aggressive transfusion strategy that was based on reduction of HbH and increase in \"functional\" hemoglobin level resulted in improvement of tissue oxygenation and reduction of hemolysis but was associated with significant increase in transfusional iron burden [Amid et al, Blood 2016] .",

It has been reported that splenectomized patients with hemolytic disorders are at even greater risk of PHTN. Several medications exist to treat PHTN, but with few studies of their efficacy or toxicities in patients with SCD. Additionally, these patients are often treated with either chronic pRBC transfusions or Hydroxyurea (HU) to raise hemoglobin, reduce hemolysis, and prevent vaso-occlusive events.",

Deoxygenated venous blood is particularly important to low shear blood flow in patients with sickle cell disease. We found that two different aggregometers predict different aggregation results for SCD. It is unclear why there is a systematic difference between the two methods, but there are some possibilities. First, the syllectogram in the LORRCA is generated by the backscatter of light from the laser, while the Myrenne measures transmitted light. Second, the distance between the bob and cup in the LORRCA is 300 microns, while the gap between plates in the Myrenne is 50 microns, which might affect the disaggregation of red cells. Further work is needed to understand the differences in red cell aggregation and aggregability when using these instruments, particularly when using aggregation as a predictor of blood flow and tissue perfusion.

Physical exam was consistent with hypovolemic shock and revealed significant splenomegaly. Laboratory testing revealed severe hypoglycemia, acidosis and electrolyte disturbances including hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia. Labs showed a leukocytosis (WBC 53,000), severely low hemoglobin (1.9), and platelets of 56,000. Coagulation testing revealed prolonged PT/INR and PTT, hypofibrinogenemia and a highly elevated D-dimer. Additional workup was completed to determine etiology of acute presentation, given broad differential diagnosis. Infectious studies were consistent with an acute EBV infection (plasma EBV PCR >550,000). Elevated levels of soluble IL-2 and ferritin completed 6/8 criteria for the diagnosis of HLH. Bone marrow evaluation showed trilineage hematopoiesis with no abnormal blast population or hemophagocytosis. Results from hemoglobin electrophoresis sent from the initial CBC sample were notable for HbS 72.5%, HbF 25.0%, and HbA of 0%, confirming the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. The patient was started on hydroxyurea and penicillin and splenomegaly resolved. With supportive care, he demonstrated gradual improvement in symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, including normalization of soluble IL-2, ferritin, CD163, IL-18 levels, immunoglobulins, and declining EBV titers. NK cell function has remained abnormally low, not eliminating the possibility of acquired HLH despite spontaneous improvement.",

There is increased immunologic platelet destruction due to production of specific autoantibodies along with inhibition of platelet production. Few randomized trials exist to guide management and ultimately each patient requires an individualized treatment plan. ITP may be acute (diagnosis to 3 m) or chronic (> 12 months). One of the treatments of chronic ITP is laparoscopic splenectomy (LS), which is very well tolerated. A rare complication of LS is splenosis, an autotransplantation or implantation of ectopic splenic tissue within the abdominal cavity or in any other unusual body compartment. Splenosis is sometimes associated with relapsed ITP due to preserved immune activity. The usual management of symptomatic splenosis is surgical resection.",

She maintained a normal platelet count for twelve years after which she relapsed (loss of response after CR) with severe thrombocytopenia and hematuria necessitating high dose steroids. CT scans showed multiple wellcircumscribed soft tissue masses in the left lower quadrant adjacent to uterus and left ovary, involving left omentum and the anterior abdominal wall partly. Findings were confirmed by damaged RBC nuclear scan to be splenosis. During laparoscopy the splenosis lesions were deemed too extensive and were not resected completely to avoid postoperative morbidity. She was started on sirolimus around the same time for treatment of her relapsed ITP and steroids were weaned off.",

In delta-storage pool disorders (DSPD,) there is a deficiency of the delta granules and their constituents, which results in the inability of platelets to properly activate as well as lack of proper constriction of blood vessels during bleeding episodes. Amongst patients with DSPD, females most commonly present with menorrhagia, while males tend to present with epistaxis and easy bruising. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) developed a screening bleeding assessment tool (BAT) for mild bleeding disorders, shown to be a validated tool in children. Diagnosis of DSPD is classically made with a platelet electron microscopy (PEM) value <3.69 delta granules per platelet (dg/pl), but recently lower diagnostic thresholds of 2 dg/pl or even 1.2 dg/pl have been suggested.",

Prioritization of who receives the factor products would be decided by a designated team based on the availability of the factor products and clinical scenarios, with no preference given to those on research trials. However, if resources are abundant, treatment for acute bleeding and standard of care prophylaxis measures, including primary prophylaxis, could continue. The second tier accounts for whether there is a new infectious epidemic or concern where a pathogen cannot be eliminated. If there is, healthcare and public health workers may limit the use of pdFVIII products. If not, pdFVIII and rFVIII products are to be equally considered. The third tier evaluates whether the clinical scenario is emergent or not. If there is acute, emergent bleeding, the immediately available resource should be used, along with bypassing and/or adjuvant resources as needed until the bleeding has resolved or improved.

Background: Stagnant blood flow in slow-flow vascular malformations (VM), particularly in their venous components, can lead to localized intravascular coagulation (LIC) that is characterized by elevated D-Dimer levels, low fibrinogen and decreased platelet count This coagulation derangement can lead to localized thrombosis or bleeding which can result in pain, functional limitations, and possible progression to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The treatment of VM and their associated coagulopathy has proven difficult.

Results: A male fetus required in utero insertion of a pleuroamniotic shunt for bilateral pleural effusions diagnosed antenatally by ultrasound. Shortly after delivery at term, he developed respiratory distress and was found to have reaccumulation of the pleural effusions. Blood work on day 1 of life showed a platelet count of 157,000/ L, which then decreased precipitously. He demonstrated schistocytes on blood-smear, signs of consumptive coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and high D-dimers, and compensatory reticulocytosis. He required multiple transfusions and admissions to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory support. Investigations ruled out congenital TTP, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and Noonan syndrome. Given high clinical suspicion for an underlying vascular lesion causing KMP, a full body MRI without contrast was undertaken. This showed a focal area of suspicious signal intensity in the upper paraspinal musculature. An ultrasound and MRI with contrast demonstrated an extensive infiltrative vascular lesion involving the paraspinal musculature, prevertebral space, posterior extrapleural space, mediastinum, and neck. The child was commenced on prednisone (2mg/kg/day) and rapamycin (0.9 mg/m2 twice/day). There was no clinical or laboratory improvement after one month. A biopsy was performed which confirmed KHE. In the second month of rapamycin therapy, the platelet count gradually normalized and the patient was discharged from hospital at 3.5-months of life. Prednisone was weaned off at 4.5 months of life. A repeat MRI at 7 months showed significant reduction in the KHE. He is now almost 2 years into therapy and doing well.",

Background: Childhood neutropenia is heterogeneous and may be congenital or acquired. Cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3) is a neurovascular malformation disorder where lesions consist of low flow, dilated capillary endothelial channels with increased permeability, predisposing to hemorrhage and thrombosis. Programmed Cell Death Protein 10 (PDCD10) activity has been implicated in glia and neuron migration, and recently linked to the dysregulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, thereby affecting cellular morphology and migration. Variants of PDCD10 encoding PDCD10 have been associated with CCM3. CCM3 causes a greater and earlier disease burden than other CCMs, with 26% presenting younger than 10 years. Some patients have associated extra-neuronal manifestations, suggesting that PDCD10 plays a role in other tissues.",

Initial bone marrow evaluation revealed a normocellular marrow but with marked granulocytic hypoplasia and 38% hematogones on flow cytometry. Florescent in situ hybridization excluded cytogenetic changes characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome. Further evaluation included testing for neutrophil antibodies, chromosome breakage, and telomere length and results were normal. Whole exome sequencing excluded mutations affecting congenital neutropenia genes, but detected a de novo PDCD10 variant (c.474+5G>A), thereby diagnosing CCM3. The neutropenia has responded well to granulocyte colony stimulation factor (GCSF), which is still needed at 26 months of age.

CBC revealed platelet count of 70 and she was referred to the ED. Abdominal ultrasound was concerning for abnormal hepatic waveform; CXR showed multiple pulmonary nodules. Workup revealed no other lesions and no further hematologic abnormalities.

The current diagnostic 'gold standard' of IFD remains culture of infected tissue obtained by biopsy. Noninvasive biomarker testing for galactomannan or 1,3-beta-D-glucan (BG) can have low sensitivity and does not provide species-level identification.

Most subjects who developed VTE scored high (score \u2265 3) on our screening tool. Only a small proportion of VTE occurred in patients older than 14 years and thus eligible for thromboprophylaxis. Our results indicate that future VTE prevention endeavors should include these age groups in addition to exploring more aggressive prophylactic modalities including pharmacological prophylaxis. Background: Pediatric fellows are required to have active engagement in quality improvement (QI) activities, and yet a national ACGME review found most trainees had \"limited knowledge of QI methods\" and \"limited participation in interprofessional QI teams\". The twenty fellows in our pediatric hematology/oncology training program identified blood culture utilization as their QI priority. Our institution recently introduced a hospital-wide decision algorithm to guide providers regarding when to obtain blood cultures. There is often a low threshold to obtain blood cultures in immunocompromised pediatric oncology patients, but these are often low-yield or result in falsepositives. Our fellows spearheaded a project to implement the algorithm in the inpatient pediatric oncology population and improve the proportion of appropriately drawn blood cultures.",

Multivariable linear regression showed that when adjusted for age, gender, cancer diagnosis and time off treatment, reported utilization of psychological services ( = 8.58, 95% CI [3.54, 13.62],p = 0.001), and parent depressive symptoms ( = 0.43, [.22, .65 ],p<0.001) were significantly associated with child overall internalizing symptoms. In an otherwise identical alternate model substituting parental anxiety for parental depression, parental anxiety was also a significant risk factor ( = 0.70, [.38, 1.03], p<0.001). Alternatively, parent anxiety/depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with child self-report of internalizing symptoms.",

Parents appreciated providers who were consistent, reliable and honest. Parents desired communication that was sensitive to the needs of the patient and family with a balance of hope and realism. Parents appreciated the tangible supports pro-vided by social work and the emotional support of child life both for the patient and their siblings. Some parents struggled to define and advocate for their child's quality of life, especially when it led to disagreeing with the medical team.

Adverse effects of these therapies include taste changes, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and/or mucositis, making it difficult for the children to be able to consume adequate amounts of nutrition during therapy. There is no \"gold standard\" measurement tool for identifying patients at risk for malnutrition. Nutritional status is not frequently evaluated as a component of clinical trials. Assessment of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, Z-scores) at diagnosis, as well as over the duration of treatment, can assist in the early identification of malnutrition.

Diagnoses and the proportion of patients undergoing HSCT was comparable in both cohorts. The average number of PTs per patient was 8,54 in cohort A and 8,24 in cohort B (p = NS), but a significant difference was found when HSCT patients were excluded from this comparison (7,34 PT per patient in cohort A vs 6,07 in cohort B, p = 0,005), which resulted in an estimated 16,4% reduction in PTs prescription. Furthermore 61 (7,1%) PTs were prescribed for bleeding episodes in cohort A versus 99 (8,2%) in Cohort B (p = NS). Patients receiving HSCT in the entire group ver-sus those not receiving HSCT had similar PT requirements for bleeding episodes (10% vs 8,5% p = NS) Conclusion: A <10 \u00d7 10e9 plt count threshold for prophylactic PTs is safe in PCP in chemotherapy and HSCT.

UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, Oakland, California, United States Background: Transition of care for adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer from pediatric to adult-oriented long-term follow-up (LTFU) is complex. Loss to follow-up is common, and little is known about the success rates among different models. The Survivors of Childhood Cancer Program (SCCP) at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland employs a community-based model for transitional care.

AYAs felt that current SRH discussions are limited and too narrow in scope and scale. AYAs reported that most SRH conversations focus exclusively on fertility (n = 17), usually taking place at the start of treatment. Other additional yet limited communication reported was about sexual activity (n = 7), contraception (n = 7), sexual function (n = 1). No AYAs reported conversations about potential treatment complications related to sexuality other than infertility. Key barriers to SRH conversations include patient discomfort initiating conversation (n = 14) and presence of family members (n = 10), with additional reported barriers including perceived provider discomfort (n = 4), lack of rapport with provider (n = 4), and age/gender differences (n = 4). AYAs felt that S207 of S301 communication tools such as handouts, brochures, and websites would be helpful facilitators to direct communication from the oncology clinician, and wanted conversations to start before treatment initiation and to continue through treatment and survivorship Conclusion: AYAs identify a key role for pediatric oncology providers in SRH care from diagnosis through survivorship, however multiple barriers interfere with discussions about SRH on a regular basis. Identified barriers suggest that future efforts should focus on provider education and training in SRH and SRH-related communication in order to optimize care provided to this unique patient population.",

Functional experiments such as overexpression of Ikaros in B-ALL primary cells results in transcriptional repression of CRLF2 whereas Ikaros silencing using shRNA resulted in increased transcription. These results suggest that Ikaros negatively regulates CRLF2 expression. Molecular inhibition of CK2 with shRNA targeting the CK2 catalytic subunit, as well as pharmacological targeting of CK2 with CX4945 resulted in transcriptional repression of CRLF2. CK2 inhibition was associated with increased Ikaros DNAbinding to the promoter of CRLF2. However, the ability of CX4945 to repress CRLF2 is lost or severely reduced, in cells with shRNA silencing of Ikaros, as compared to cells with intact Ikaros. Moreover, similar results were noted following treatment with CX4945 in leukemia cells obtained from high risk B-ALL patients with deletion of one IKZF1 allele. Ikaros binds poorly to promoters of CRLF2 gene in these cells. Treatment with CX4945 restores Ikaros DNAbinding to the promoters of CRLF2, which is associated with its strong repression. Serial qChIP analysis of the epigenetic signature at the CRLF2 promoter showed that increased Ikaros binding to the CRLF2 promoter, following CK2 inhibition, is associated with enrichment for the H3K9me3 histone modification, which is a marker of repressive chromatin.",

There are several important differences between ALL in individuals with DS (DS-ALL) and ALL in individuals without DS (NDS-ALL): First, patients with DS-ALL have a lower percentage of favorable cytogenetic features compared to NDS-ALL. Second, patients with DS-ALL are more likely to have activating mutations in JAK2, CRLF2 overexpression, and IKZF1 deletions. Despite these clear genotypic differences, this knowledge has not yet been exploited for therapeutic purposes in DS-ALL. When outcomes for DS-ALL are compared to NDS-ALL with similar cytogenetic features, the survival rates are similar. However, individuals with DS-ALL have an increased risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM). Current therapy for DS-ALL is similar to that for NDS-ALL, with the exception of small changes to decrease toxicities that are more prevalent in DS-ALL. It was recently identified that interferon signaling is constitutively activated in healthy individuals with T21. We hypothesize that aberrant interferon signaling could play a role in the unique leukemias observed in DS patients.",

Expression of CDC42 was also noted to be higher in ALL patient samples compared to normal bone marrow. Functional experiments showed that Ikaros overexpression via retroviral transduction results in transcriptional repression of CDC42. Ikaros silencing using shRNA resulted in increased expression of CDC42. These data suggest that Ikaros negatively regulates transcription and expression of CDC42. CK2 directly phosphorylates Ikaros and impairs its function as transcription factor. We noted that molecular inhibition of CK2 via SiRNA as well as treatment with specific CK2 inhibitor, CX4945 also decreases expression of CDC42. Treatment with CX4945 of primary B-ALL with Ikaros haploinsufficiency restores Ikaros binding to CDC42 promoter and represses CDC42 expression. However, this effect is evident only in presence of Ikaros. Treatment with CX4945 in Ikaros silenced (Ikaros ShRNA) cells showed no change in expression of CDC42. These results emphasizes the importance of Ikaros in regulating CDC42 expression. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in epigenetic signature at the CDC42 promoter following treatment with CX4945. Results show that loss of histone marker of open chromatin (H3K9ac) and increased histone marker for repressive chromatin (H3K27me3), at the CDC42 promoter.

Currently, approximately one-third of patients with pediatric AML relapse on standard chemotherapy regimens.

This leads to activation of cell stress pathways, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Background: Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is an immunosuppressive thiopurine drug that is a key component of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. 6-MP is metabolized into 6-thioguanine (6-TGN), which is responsible for anti-leukemic effects, as well as 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MMPN/6-MMP), which are associated with hepatotoxicity. Some patients preferentially metabolize 6-MP to 6-MMPN/6-MMP, increasing their risk for hepatotoxicity and potentially reducing anti-leukemic effects. Hepatotoxicity can cause interruptions or delays in therapy that may jeopardize cure rates. Allopurinol has been increasingly used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to shunt 6-MP metabolism toward 6-TGN and away from 6-MMPN to minimize hepatotoxicity and preserve therapeutic effects.",

Further analysis of 6-MP dose titration and effects on ANC over time as well as effects on overall survival is ongoing. Prospective Background: Alterations in epigenetic patterning are a fundamental feature in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) yields responses in AML, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. In prior work, we demonstrated induction of genes involved in the piRNA RNA (PIWI) silencing pathway as a common gene feature of 4 AML cell lines treated with decitabine. The PIWI pathway is an RNA silencing system, distinct from classical small RNA transcriptional silencing, responsible for transposon-silencing in gametogenesis; emerging data suggest a role for this system in somatic cells. Based on these data, we postulate that PIWI induction plays a crucial role in AML recovery following demethylation and that disruption of this pathway would modulate response and/or recovery from decitabine treatment.",

Although NK/T cell lymphomas occurring in childhood and adolescence comprise a small portion of all lymphomas, they present many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The role of angiogenesis in lymphoma pathogenesis is becoming more evident. High molecular weight kininogen (HK) is a central compo-nent of the kallikrein-kinin system.

Background: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is an inflammatory myeloid neoplasia characterized by frequent relapse, with treatment failure associated with higher risk of death and neurodegenerative disease (LCH-ND). Activating somatic mutations in MAPK pathway genes have been identified in almost all cases, with BRAF-V600E in approximately 60% of lesions. Targeted therapies have been successful in treating other refractory cancers with BRAF V600E mutations (such as melanoma). Given the central role of MAPK pathway activation in LCH, MAPK pathway inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for children with LCH.",

At diagnosis, median vertebral height loss was 37.5% compared to 25% at last imaging control. Most used imaging modalities were PET-scan and plain X-Rays. Treatments were diverse and consisted in chemotherapy in all children but three and bisphosphonates in only 3 cases. Radiation therapy was not used in any patient. Six out 11 patients did benefit of an orthosis. A LCH recurrence was observed in 6 patients and involved vertebrae in 4 cases.

Enoxaparin was given subcutaneous (100 I.U/Kg) and diclofenac was given intra-peritoneal (2 mg/Kg) daily for five days. Then, markers of pancreatic injury, lipids, immune cell infiltration and oxidative stress were analyzed with histo-pathological examination of the pancreatic tissue Results: During acute pancreatitis, oxidative stress markers were significantly changed as indicated by reduced tis-sue glutathione and increased malondialdehyde levels. This was accompanied with significant increase in immune cells infiltration as indicated by high levels of myeloperoxidase and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha.

Background: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) with H3K27M mutation, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), are the leading cause of brain tumor-related deaths in children. There are no effective therapeutic strategies and the median survival remains dismal.

Panobinostat, a multiple histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was found to be one of the most effective agents against DIPG patient-derived cell cultures and xenograft models in previous studies and is presently in clinical trial for DIPG.

Background: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumor of childhood and the leading cause of childhood cancer deaths. While medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood with a 5-year survival 70-80%, children with high-grade gliomas (HGGs) such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) fare much worse with a 5-year survival of 15-35%. Implicated in this poor outcome is the presence of treatment resistant brain tumor stem-like cells. GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) have been implicated in tumor growth, treatment resistance and patient relapse, making them a key therapeutic priority. Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been used for decades in various psychiatric clinical settings and are associated with a lower incidence of cancer, including malignant brain tumors. Currently, atypical APDs are being evaluated for their potential to alleviate cancer and treatment induced side effects.

The granulocyte stimulating factor receptor (GCSF-R or CD114) is well understood in the context of hematopoiesis, but its role in solid tumor pathogenesis is less clear. Neuroblastoma and melanoma subpopulations expressing GCSF-R have cancer stem cell properties of chemoresistance and increased tumorigenicity, and are enriched in tumors after chemotherapy. GCSF-R activation leads to signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic target. We hypothesized that a subpopulation of medulloblastoma cells would express the GCSF-R and that this subpopulation would demonstrate chemoresistance and response to inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway.",

Tumor derived RNA-NPs induced antigen specific T cell immunity and mediated anti-tumor efficacy in several pre-clinical solid tumor models (i.e. B16F10, KR158B). When administered intravenously, RNA-NPs increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules (i.e. CD80, CD86, CD40, CCR7) and PD-L1 on CD11c+ cells throughout reticuloendothelial organs (i.e. spleen, liver, bone marrow) and within the tumor microenvironment; this phenotype was strictly dependent on type I interferon. Targeted inhibition of type I interferon signaling (via INFAR1 mAbs) abrogated anti-tumor efficacy mediated by RNA-NPs. We enhanced the immunogenicity of this platform by simply combining mRNAs encoding for immunomodulatory molecules (i.e. HCV-PAMPs, GM-CSF) or by combining RNA-NPs with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Addition of checkpoint inhibitors (PD-L1 mAbs) to RNA-NPs increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and intratumoral MHC class I/II expression, and mediated synergistic anti-tumor activity in settings where PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibition alone did not confer therapeutic benefit. We then explored the feasibility of RNA-NPs in a large animal osteosarcoma model.

Background: Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor affecting mainly adolescent and young adults. Treatments are based on compressed schedule chemotherapy combined with local control (surgery and/or radiation). Prognosis is poorer for patients with metastatic disease, older age and central primaries. Survival when disease recurs within two years of diagnosis is <10%. The EWS-FLI1 fusion gene t(11; 22) (q24; q12) has been well characterized as a dominant EWS driver-gene. The most common variation is EWS exon 7 with FLI1 exon 6 (60% of fusion positive patients). We designed a novel pbi-shRNA TM EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX which has demonstrated, safety and efficacy in animal model (Rao et all).

Background: As more children with CNS malignancies (BT) are surviving, the late effects of the therapies they receive are better described. Studies show that radiation therapy is particularly harmful to neurocognitive functioning, specifically processing speed, working memory, and attention span. These deficits have negative effects on quality of life, especially in academic and professional settings. A large proportion of S255 of S301 adult survivors of BT are unable to reach adult milestones such as living on their own, holding a steady job, and getting married. Proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT), is touted for the potential to have fewer and less severe side effects than traditional photon radiation therapy (XRT). Because of the properties of protons, the amount of damaging energy released in non-target healthy tissue is reduced when compared to XRT. Although a study comparing IQ testing between PBRT and XRT found no difference between the two therapies, no studies have compared the specific neurocognitive domains. It would be valuable to evaluate full neurocognitive testing scores (NCT) since the specific domains, particularly processing speed (PSI), appear to be most vulnerable to radiation therapy.",

However, the importance of this clinical observation indicates a likely enhanced immune system associated with infection, supporting the role of immunotherapy for treatment of these aggressive tumors. Background: Hypoalbuminemia is a well-recognized effect of cancer and other chronic illnesses and is often regarded as a marker of malnutrition. In adults, hypoalbuminemia has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with cancers of the lung, pelvis, head and neck, gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow, as well as in some pediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Hypoalbuminemia has not been well studied in children with cancer.",

While PVNS is rarely fatal, aggressive disease and/or extensive surgery can result in substantial functional impairment.

Background: Metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) carries a poor prognosis with three-year event free survival rates ranging between 20%-69% (depending on Oberlin risk factors) due to the lack of significantly effective breakthroughs in the recent past. There is an urgent and unmet need for new treatment strategies against this disease. Metastatic RMS cell lines exhibit increased expression of the ERM family membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein Ezrin. Knockdown of ezrin expression using siRNAs decreases the metastatic potential of these cells, whereas forced expression of ezrin results in increased degree of metastasis. The activity of ezrin is controlled by its phosphorylation at the Threonine 567 (Thr567) residue at the C-terminus of the protein, suggesting that alteration of ezrin phosphorylation may control RMS growth and metastasis.",

An ultrasound demonstrated an 8 \u00d7 6 cm mass arising from the right ovary with large volume ascites. She required admission to the intensive care unit due to S261 of S301 respiratory distress from her significant ascites. Serum tumor marker including HCG, AFP and LDH were negative. Patient underwent right oophorectomy with tumor capsule noted to be open at time of surgery. Further imaging post operatively demonstrated no other sites of disease. The patient was classified as FIGO Stage IC due to the presence of her significant abdominal ascites that was presumed to be malignant pre-operative tumor rupture.5 The pathological diagnosis was challenging and eventually resulted as a mixed germ cell sex cord stromal tumor with pattern of Sertoli cell tumor with neuroendocrine differentiation. Based on the staging of FIGO IC with pre-operative rupture, the decision was made to treat with a standard platinum based regimen as there is a higher incidence of relapse in stage IC patients when compared to IA treated with observation alone.6 Our patient tolerated four cycles of chemotherapy well and end of therapy scans showed no evidence of disease. Interestingly, her DICER mutation genetics performed by Ion Torrent TM Next Generation Sequencing was negative in germline and tumor studies.",

Background: Approximately 12% of patients with Wilms tumor (WT) have metastatic disease at diagnosis and often have a grave prognosis. Limited cell lines are available for the study of metastatic WT and long-term passaged cell lines do not always recapitulate the human condition. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that controls cellular pathways involved in the tumorigenesis of pediatric renal tumors. Using a novel patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model from a patient's primary WT (COA 25) and matched isogenic metastatic WT (COA 42), we previously demonstrated that FAK is expressed and its inhibition led to decreased tumorigenicity of both the primary and metastatic PDXs. Kinomic profiling is an innovative, high-throughput method used to investigate kinase signaling to identify potential therapeutic targets. To date, the kinomic profile of primary and metastatic WT has not been examined.",

MRI abdomen and FDG PET at diagnosis showed S267 of S301 multiple liver metastases but could not identify the primary lesion. Ga-68 scan was able to accurately identify the enlarged lymph nodes in the small bowel and was better than FDG PET in delineating the liver metastases. Second patient was a 13-year-old female with recurrent small bowel NET with liver, lung and paraspinal metastases. The lesions were initially detected by CT scan. Octreotide scan failed to show any uptake in the identified lesions while Ga-68 was taken up by the liver lesions, lung lesions >1 cm in size and the paraspinal lesion. Third patient is an 8year-old male with pancreatic NET with peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, multiple liver metastases and cardiophrenic lymph node involvement. The primary lesion in the pancreas could not be identified by CT scan, CT angiogram, MIBG scan, or octreotide scan. In addition, there was uncertainty about involvement of the enlarged cardiophrenic lymph node. In addition to clearly identifying the primary lesion, Ga-68 scan was able to detect multiple peripancreatic lymph nodes not detected by other scans and revealed uptake in the cardiophrenic lymph node confirming its involvement by the tumor. Fourth patient is a 15-year-old female with malignant abdominal paraganglioma with solitary lung metastasis. Both MIBG scan and Ga-68 scan were able to identify the primary lesion. Ga-68 scan was performed after the lung metastasis was removed and thus its ability to detect it could not be confirmed.

Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent aggressive primary malignancy of the bone affecting children and young adults. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients have metastatic disease at initial presentation, and 61% of those patients have isolated pulmonary metastases. Although overall survival in patients with OS has improved with advances in therapy, there have been no significant improvements in survival outcome in patients with metastatic disease. Recent studies suggest that tumor-associated Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (tVCAM-1 or CD106) plays a critical role in the metastatic progression of various tumors. Indirect evidence from these studies suggest that VCAM-1/ 4 1 integrin signaling promotes tumor survival and metastatic progression by changing the tumor niche and associated immune response.",

Background: Osteosarcoma is one of the deadliest cancers in the pediatric population with little progress in morbidity and recurrence rates since the 1980's. Oncolytic Herpes Simplex-1 virus (oHSV) is an attenuated virus that has shown encouraging results against certain solid tumors. Programmed cell death protein (PD)-1-mediated T cell suppression via engagement of its ligand, PD-L1, is also of particular interest due to recent successes in selected cancers, especially those with high genetic mutational loads. Most pediatric cancers do not have a wide variety of mutations; however, osteosarcoma has a chaotic genome, prone to genetic mutations. It has been shown through numerous other studies that PD-1 inhibition alone is not sufficient to result in statistically significant tumor growth delays in osteosarcoma models and patients.

It is often metastatic at diagnosis and in this scenario less than 30% of children survive. Polyamines, small molecules found in all cells, are involved in many cell processes including cell cycle regulation, immune modulation, cell signaling and apoptosis. They are also involved in tumor development, invasion and metastasis. In neuroblastoma, inhibition of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway with ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) results in decreased cell proliferation and differentiation. These finding have led to multiple phase I and phase 2 II multicenter clinical trials in pediatric neuroblastoma patients. DFMO is an attractive drug as it is oral, well-tolerated, can be given for prolonged periods and is already used in pediatric patients. The polyamine pathway has not been evaluated in osteosarcoma.",

Background: Recent studies demonstrate that lower levels of the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein are associated with enhanced metastatic capability in Ewing sarcoma. The NF-kB transcription factor is a critical mediator of CXCR4 and CXCR7 -driven metastasis in multiple cancers, and increased CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression have each been associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in Ewing sarcoma.

Genetic knock-out of CXCR4 lead to significant decrease in expression of both CXCL12/SDF-1 and IL-6, two NF-kB transcriptional targets known to play a key role in tumor metastasis. Knock-out of CXCR4 did not alter endogenous EWS-FLI1 mRNA levels. Conversely, lowering the level of EWS-FLI1 using siRNA lead to enhanced NF-kB signaling, indicated by an increase in p65 DNA binding. Consistent with this observation, treating Ewing cell lines with EWS-FLI1 siRNA also resulted in significantly increased NF-kB target gene expression compared to control cells and target gene expression was then further enhanced upon CXCR4/CXCR7 receptor stimulation with the receptor ligand CXCL12/SDF-1.",

We have been working on universal access to care for children from S275 of S301 all socioeconomic background and incorporating innovations to reduce the cost of HSCT without compromising outcomes. Haploidentical HSCT using TCR / depletion costs 18000 USD as compared to PTCy priced at 25 USD. Children with severe aplastic anemia and PIDs can be transplanted using reduced intensity conditioning and PTCy. In hemoglobinopathies, pretransplant immunosuppression is required to prevent graft rejection. Graft versus host disease remains the main cause of mortality in children with Fanconi anemia.

Background: In neutropenic pediatric patients, infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While granulocyte transfusions have been utilized for decades to treat infections, including in the pediatric population, the efficacy of this intervention remains poorly described. Previous guidelines have primarily utilized information from adult populations. Furthermore, recruitment of donors typically involves friends or relatives of the patient with periodic involvement of community donors. The use of a readily available local donor population to improve availability has yet to be well described. As the immunocompromised population is particularly susceptible to worsening infection and clinical deterioration, the ability to rapidly harvest and deliver granulocytes warrants further investigation.",

The protocol was approved by Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Results: 7 patients (4 primary metastatic high risk disease, 3 relapsed or recurrent disease) received HDC with ASCR. Primary diagnoses were rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (n = 2, alveolar histology), primary site nasopharynx (n = 1) and lower extremity (n = 1). Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) (n = 5), axial site (pelvic) in 3 patients (60%). Median age 12 years (range 6-35 years), 5 (71%) were male. All patients were in complete metabolic remission before transplant. Median pre transplant comorbidity index was 3 (range 0-4). 5 patients (2 RMS and 3 EWS) received conditioning with carboplatin, etoposide and melphalan. Remaining 2 patients with EWS received conditioning with busulfan, melphalan and topotecan. All patients received peripheral blood mobilized hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Stem cell mobilization achieved with high dose filgrastim in all patients except one who required addition of plerixafor. Median CD34+/Kg S297 of S301 recipient body weight cell dose infused was 6.34 \u00d7 10^6 (range 2.72-12.03 \u00d7 10^6). Median times to neutrophil and platelet (>20,000/\u00c2 L) engraftment were 9 (range 8-13) and 49 (20-76) days respectively. 2 patients (28%) developed BK viuria (one with grade III hemorrhagic cystitis); 3 (43%) developed CMV viremia; and one patient (14%) had asymptomatic EBV viremia. There was no graft failure, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or transplant related mortality. Median follow up post-transplant was 452 days (range 155-1141 days). 3 year probability of OS and RFS were 80% and 50% respectively.",

Background: Cardiac dysfunction, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), is a known complication in stem cell transplant (SCT) survivors. While detection of LVSD by echocardiography is important in this population, there has been minimal research to determine if subclinical cardiac dysfunction exists in SCT patients. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a valuable tool to assess cardiac function, and to determine how the heart responds to the stress of exercise.

Maniscalco, Lauren S., Yong Yi, Xiao-Cheng Wu Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center / Children's Hospital of New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States Background: Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) such as Rituximab were introduced as targeted agent for the treatment of B cell lymphomas in 2006. However, information on use of these drugs in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population and its impact on survival are lacking. Objectives: The objective of our study is to examine changes in use of Mab over time, factors associated with the use, and the survival benefit for the AYA population. Design/Method: Data were from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Patterns of Care Study which included 15-39-year-old AYA patients diagnosed with B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) in 2006 and in 2013. We examined the association of age, race, gender, insurance, hospital residency, hospital bed, physician specialty, protocol registration, and diagnosis year with the utilization of Mab using multivariable logistic regression. The effect of Mab on survival was examined with a Cox proportional hazards survival model. Only 2006 data was used for survival analysis since 2013 data did not have sufficient follow-up time. Results: A total of 1,413 AYA patients were diagnosed with B-cell NHL in 2006 (n = 502) and 2013 (n = 911). The use Mab increased from 71.6% in 2006 to 75.8% in 2013. The use of Mab did not vary significantly by age or gender. Compared to white patients, black AYAs were less likely to receive Mab (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 0.66, p = 0.02). Privately insured patients were significantly less likely to be treated with Mab when compared to Medicaid patients (adjusted OR 0.69, p = 0.03). Several factors that had statistical significance and were associated with utilization of Mab in 2006 diminished in 2013, such as no insurance and hospital bed size. In 2006, patients who received the drugs had significant improvement in survival (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI (0.35, 0.89)). We estimated that if the AYA population in 2006 who had not received Mab had received the drugs their estimated 5year survival rates would have improved from 82.2% to 89.7%.",

Design/Method: 5-year OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with standard errors (SE) calculated per Peto and curves compared using the log-rank test among patients enrolled on frontline ALL therapeutic trials from 2000-10. Outcomes were analyzed among gender, age, lineage, NCI risk group and racial/ethnic ALL subgroups over two sequential time eras: 2000-05 and 2006-10. Results: 5-year OS improved significantly from 90.3% (SE 0.4%) in 2000-05 (n = 7842) to 91.5% (SE 0.4%) in 2006-10 (n = 8090), p = 0.0286 among all patients. The most dramatic improvement was observed in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) where 5year OS rose from 80.8% (SE 1.9%) in 2000-05 (n = 515) to 90.6% (SE 1.7%) in 2006-10 (n= 676), p<0.0001. Significant improvements in outcome were also observed in NCI standard risk patients and in children 1-9 years of age regardless of NCI risk-group, where 5-year OS now exceeds 95%. Nonsignificant improvements in survival were observed among boys and their 5-year OS now matches that observed in girls. While the survival gap between blacks and whites decreased by 50% from 2000-05 to 2006-10, outcomes for Hispanics remained inferior and static with 5-year OS of 87.9% (SE 0.9%) in 2000-05 vs. 87.7% (SE 1.1%) in 2006-10, p = 0.5898. Importantly, no survival improvements were observed at either end of the age spectrum. The 5-year OS for infants < 1 year of age was 53.5% (SE 4.1%) in 2000-05 (n = 159) vs. 47.2% (SE 7.9%) in 2006-10 (n = 82), p = 0.4858. While many more (4.7% vs. 7.6%, p<0.0001) adolescents and young adults (AYAs) 16 years or older were enrolled in the recent era, 5-year OS was unchanged: 78.0% (SE 2.5%; n = 369) in 2000-05 and 77.3% (SE 2.4%; n = 618) in 2006-10.",

PBRT shows that it might have a protective effect for PSI however no improvement was seen in WMI or FSIQ. The role of PBRT in cognitive protection compared to XRT may be minimal, however a larger multi-institutional chart review may be of benefit to further evaluate.Poster # 813 THE ROLE OF ROUTINE IMAGING IN CHILDHOOD MELANOMA (MM)Hadeel Halalsheh, Sue Kaste, Armita Bahrami, Fariba Navid, Barry Shulkin, Bhaskar Rao, Alberto Pappo, Michelle Kunkel St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States Background: Optimal imaging for children with MM has not been established.",

PNET: COMPARING EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOMES OVER 40 YEARS USING SURVEILLANCE, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND END RESULTS DATA Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachussetts, United States Background: Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are classified under the umbrella of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) given their shared biology, though histologic features differ between PNET and Ewing sarcoma (ES). Potential clinical differences between PNET and ES have not been fully elucidated. Design/Method: Through the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Results (SEER) database, we identified 3,645 patients with histologic diagnosis of ES or PNET from 1973 -2014. We used Fisher's exact tests to compare patient and tumor characteristics between groups. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate overall survival.Results: Patients with ES were more likely to be male, \u2264 18 years old at diagnosis, white, and Hispanic compared to patients with patients with PNET (p = 0.016 for sex; p<0.001 for all other variables). Patients with PNET were more likely to have soft tissue primary tumors (p<0.001) and, among those with bone tumors, a lower rate of axial or pelvic tumors (p<0.001). Patients with PNET had significantly worse 5-year survival compared to ES patients, though the absolute difference was small (51.3% vs. 55.5%; p<0.001). Survival for patients with PNET diagnosed in the 1990's and later more closely approximated those of patients with ES, while patients with PNET diagnosed in the 1980's and earlier had inferior outcomes.Conclusion: Despite shared underlying biology, patients with PNET and ES show differences in clinical presentation and overall survival, with the latter differences largely mitigated in more recent decades.Poster # 825 KINOMIC ALTERATIONS OF PRIMARY AND METASTATIC WILMS TUMOR BY FOCAL ADHESION KINASE INHIBITIONJamie Aye, Joshua Anderson, Jerry Stewart, Laura Stafman, Adele Williams, Karina Yoon, Kimberly Whelan, Christopher Willey, Elizabeth Beierle University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States",

Chemotherapy required to achieve this rate is associated with a lifetime risk of cardiac deaths, second malignancies, pulmonary disease and infertility. As effective salvage therapy exists, outcomes may be improved by de-intensifying initial therapy to lessen toxicity.Objectives: We piloted a regimen in low and intermediate risk HL patients using agents without known association to significant late effects. This retrospective chart review was approved by Children's Minnesota IRB.Design/Method: The BVG(P) regimen incorporated bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 day 1,4,8,11); vinorelbine (25 mg/m2 day 1,8); gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 day 1,8) every 21 days and prednisone (20 mg/m2/dose BID x 11 days). We treated 5 newly diagnosed patients, ages 10-18 years, with non-bulk stage IIA (n = 4) or IIB (n = 1) HL. Two patients received BVG and 3 received BVGP with the addition of prednisone.Results: Newly diagnosed patients were all PET negative after the first or second cycle and remained PET negative at end of therapy, 4 cycles. Nausea was well controlled with 5-HT3 antagonists and scopolamine. Pegfilgrastim was not necessary due to the high absolute neutrophil count nadir [median 1.16 and minimum 0.56 \u00d7 109/L]. There were no episodes of febrile neutropenia, infection or transfusion need. No patients experienced alopecia. One patient developed sensory neuropathy after the eighth dose of bortezomib that was controlled with gabapentin and a switch to subcutaneous bortezomib administration. Of the five newly diagnosed patients, four remain in remission at 227, 270, 557, 1191 days; 1 relapsed at previous disease sites at 861 days and subsequently achieved remission with BVGP with the addition of brentuximab.",

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States Background: Childhood brain tumors are the most common solid malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children. The most aggressive type of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Despite decades of clinical trials, there has been no substantial improvement with respect to therapeutic outcomes with most children eventually succumbing to the disease. Research on adult high-grade gliomas has shown a targetable pathway through the inflammationinduced expression of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and its recognized ability to suppress the anti-tumor immune response. A limited understanding into the role of IDO1 in pediatric central nervous system tumors serves as the foundation of this research project. Furthermore, the integration of nanotechnology is a fundamental step for the investigation and targeting of IDO1. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) composed of nanoparticles have been shown to transverse cellular membranes, exhibit stability in physiological environments, escape from degradation, and create precise targeting in brain tumors.Objectives: The purpose of our project is to delineate the role of IDO1 in pediatric DIPG, and develop small inhibitory (si)RNA oligonucleotides and SNAs aimed at therapeutically inhibiting the gene expression of immunosuppressive IDO1. Our specific aims are to: (1) confirm the gene expression IDO1 in different human DIPG cell lines; (2) generate and characterize siRNA oligonucleotides targeting human IDO1 in vitro; and (3) generate and characterize gold nanoparticles for targeted inhibition of IDO1.Design/Method: Unique patient-derived DIPG cell lines were grown in culture, stimulated with increasing concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine, IFN , and analyzed for mRNA levels. siRNA specific to IDO1 was transfected into cells. SNA generation is in progress.Results: IDO1 is expressed in multiple human pediatric DIPG cell lines. siRNA targeting IDO1 among exons 9 and 10 results in a significant decrease in overall IDO1 expression by DIPG cells. SNA generation for targeting IDO1 with improved penetration & stability is ongoing, with preliminary results demonstrating a robust ability to inhibit IDO1 expression.",

Consolidation therapy with carboplatin and thiotepa was piloted in CCG-99703, COG ACNS0333, and COG ACNS0334 with the goals of intensifying therapy and omitting or delaying radiation.Objectives: To document outcomes for patients undergoing carboplatin/thiotepa consolidation with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) and to demonstrate the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen.Design/Method: Patients up to 3 years old (median age: 12 months) with malignant CNS tumors treated at the University of Rochester from 2012-2017 with at least one cycle of carboplatin (17 mg/kg/day x 2 days) and thiotepa (10 mg/kg x 2 days) followed by peripheral blood ASCR were included in retrospective analysis. Data were recorded on time to engraftment (defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery to > 0.5 \u00d7 10^9/l), length of hospitalization, toxicity with each consolidation cycle, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Stem cell harvest data were also collected.Results: Eleven patients with malignant CNS tumors (6 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, 3 primitive neuroectodermal tumor, 1 glioblastoma multiforme, and 1 pineoblastoma) received a total of 30 cycles of carboplatin/thiotepa. Of these, 9 underwent stem cell harvest at our institution, with complications limited to procedure-related hypotension for 1 patient with known autonomic instability, and catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for 1 patient. Four patients were in complete remission (CR) 1/status-post gross total resection, 1 was in CR2, and 6 had residual tumor at the time of consolidation. Nine patients received 3 planned consolidation cycles, 1 patient 2 (of 2) planned cycles, and 1 patient 1 of an anticipated 3 cycles thus far. Average time to engraftment for these 30 cycles was 10.2 (+/-1.4) days, with a mean hospital length of stay of 16 (+/-3.2) days. Fever occurred in 17 of 30 cycles (57%); infectious toxicity included documented bacterial infection in 2 cases (Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1). There were no regimenrelated deaths. With a mean follow-up of 23 months, 2 survivors have not yet completed all therapies, and 5 patients have relapsed (4 have died of disease). Of the 7 survivors, 4 have been disease-free for >12 months. Background: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) has resulted in improved survival for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Treatment intensification is however associated with greater complications. Data on early infectious complications in low-and-middle income countries are limited.Objectives: To review the early infectious complications following auto-HSCT in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.Design/Method: A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who underwent auto-HSCT at the American University of Beirut Medical Center between 2003 and 2017 was conducted. Infectious complications during the first 100 days post-transplant were reviewed.Results: Forty-three patients (27 males and 16 females) with a median age at diagnosis of 4.35 years [range: 0.5-13.9] years underwent auto-HSCT during the above-mentioned period. Conditioning regimen consisted of Melphalan, Etoposide and Carboplatin. All patients received antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis. Median time for neutrophil engraftment was 10 days [range: 8-19]. Bacteremia and Clostridium difficile infections occurred in 16 (37%) and 12 (28 %) patients respectively. Seven (16%) patients developed enterocolitis diagnosed by imaging, 4 were adenovirus induced. CMV viremia was diagnosed in 7 (16%) patients, 5 of whom required treatment. Varicella zoster reactivation, parvovirus viremia, toxoplasmosis encephalitis, BK virus cystitis (2 patients) and central nervous system EBV related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder were diagnosed in 6 different patients. There was no invasive fungal infection. Sixteen (37%) patients have died, 6 of whom died in the early post-transplant period, 1 due to disease progression and 5 (11.6%) due to infectious complications. Among the 5 patients who died due to infection, 1 developed toxoplasmosis encephalitis, 4 developed severe enterocolitis, 2 of which were adenovirus related. The mean IgG level within one week post-transplant was lower in patients with clinically significant viral infection compared to others (4 vs 5.6 mg/dl, p: 0.08). The mean IgG level at the time of clinically significant bacterial infection was lower in infected patients compared to others (4.4 vs 6.3 mg/dl, p: 0.03). Neither absolute lymphocyte count nor absolute neutrophil count at day 20 post-transplant affected the incidence of clinically significant infections.",

He received a matched (10/10) unrelated donor HSCTmarrow product-conditioned with busulfan, fludarabine, and anti-thymoglobulin (ATG). His post-transplant course was complicated by HHV-6 viremia, PRES (prompting a change from prograf to cyclosporine), mucositis, and grade III acute GVHD (skin S3, Gut S2, Liver S0) around post transplant day 101, which later morphed to ocular involvement by D+120. He was started on 2 mg/kg steroids with good response but flared up with each attempt to taper steroid dose. A course of rituximab and later ATG were tried without success in weaning off steroids. Switching cyclosporine to sirolimus did not provide any additional benefit either. Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) was started 3 times a week. He initially responded well, yet was not able to wean off steroids. In addition, he developed a flare when ECP session was reduced to 2 days per week. ECP was therefore increased to 5 days per week, which appeared to stabilize skin lesions. A trial of weekly methotrexate was attempted to wean off steroids and photopheresis, which provided no response. Finally, a trial of bortezomib on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 day cycle as published in a case series of multiple myeloma patients who developed post HSCT GVHD. Skin lesions improved remarkably however dose had to be reduced due to related pancytopenia. Given the response to therapy, he was continued on a weekly dose of bortezomib, receiving a total 8 doses, which has permitted the slow taper of prednisone that has since been discontinued without a major flare. He however is currently maintained on ECP 3 times per week, which is now been slowly withdrawn.Conclusion: Management of acute GVHD in pediatric patients after HSCT can be challenging with no definite options for those who fail steroids or become steroid dependent after initial response. In these situations, bortezomib could be a valid therapeutic option.",

The addition of immunotherapy has improved survival and includes anti-GD2 antibody therapy. The success of antibody therapy in neuroblastoma is primarily due to natural killer (NK) cell mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We previously demonstrated that NK cells from patients with high risk NBL can be successfully isolated and expanded to large numbers and exhibit potent anti-tumor effects against NBL (1). Thus, infusions of autologous expanded NK cells in high risk NBL in combination with anti-GD2 antibody are being studied in clinical trials. Toll-like receptors (TLR) present on the surface of leukocytes are responsible for pathogen recognition, and activation of these receptors stimulate the production of cytokines that critically link innate and adaptive immune responses. The TLR3 agonist, Poly(IC) is a synthetic analog of dsRNA that has previously been shown to directly stimulate cytokine production and improve cytotoxicity in primary NK cells through activation of genes regulated by interferon-response elements (IRE) (2).",

We investigated the mechanism behind these functional changes and profiled 92 genes involved in TGF BETA signaling. We found significant reduction of SMAD3 transcription which corresponded to a striking decrease in SMAD3 chromatin accessibility. We also found significantly increased SMAD6 and decreased TGFBR3 expression. Phenotypic analysis revealed that TGF BETA also induced remodeling of the NK receptor repertoire with decreased NKp30, CD16, and KLRG1 and upregulation of TRAIL. The functional consequences of these TGF BETA-induced changes on in vitro and in vivo NK cell function are currently under investigation. Background: The use of T-cell depleted grafts in haploidentical stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been associated with a delay in early T-cell recovery which increases the risk of viral infections, relapse or graft rejection.

Selective T-cell depletion based on the elimination of T cells carrying and chains of the T-cell receptor may greatly reduce the GVHD risks, while allowing the maintenance of mature donor-derived alloreactive NK cells and / (+) T cells, which may augment the anti-leukemia effect.Objectives: This is a prospective study of CAYA with acute leukemia who underwent HSCT with MMRD or URDs and TCR / /CD19 depletion. Outcomes included engraftment, toxicities, viral reactivation, and relapse.Design/Method: This study included 36 CAYA with acute leukemia transplanted between October 2014 and May 2017.

Transplant characteristics, post-HCT dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan results, vitamin D levels, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) status, and FSH levels were reviewed. For patients 2-20 years of age, height corrected Z-scores were calculated using a NIHvalidated calculator, with T-scores used for older patients. BMD was categorized as low if between -1 and -2 SD below the mean and clinically significantly low if >-2 SD, in accordance with the Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines. Vitamin D levels <20 ng/mol were considered deficient, and FSH levels >40mIU/ml suggestive of premature ovarian failure. Fisher's exact test was used to compare variables in those with normal versus abnormal DEXA scan results, with p<0.05 considered significant.Results: HCT was performed on 71 patients with SCD, with 67 surviving \u22651 year post-HCT. DEXA scans were obtained in 40 patients (55% female), with mean time from HCT to DEXA scan being 4 years (1.3-11.2 years) and mean age at time of DEXA 13.1 years (6.1-22.3 years). Patients with and without DEXA scans did not differ by sex, donor source, age at transplant, or vitamin D status. Low BMD was noted in 10 patients (25.0%), with these patients more likely to be >13 years (pubertal; 90.0 versus 40.0%, p = 0.009). Acute GVHD was more common in patients with low BMD (50.0 versus 16.7%), but not statistically significant (p = 0.085). Clinically significant low BMD was noted in 3 patients (7.5% of those with DEXA scans). These patients were older (16.2 years at testing), were more likely to be male (66.6%), and all had acute and chronic GVHD, while none had evidence of gonadal failure.Conclusion: Clinically significant low BMD is uncommon after HSCT for SCD. Patients at risk for low BMD include older patients and likely those with GVHD. This preliminary data suggests routine DEXAs may not be indicated for all patients who undergo HCT for SCD, but further data is needed.",

We sought to investigate the incidence of, and risk factors for, acute kidney injury in pediatric HCT patients and associated risk with mortality.Design/Method: Data from patients who underwent HCT between 2013 and 2016 at a single institution were sequentially retrospectively captured on IRB approved protocol. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined at multiple time points post-HCT using the standardized criteria: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Interval differences between values were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum testing and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square analysis.Results: Ninety-eight patients were included in the study: allogeneic (n = 96) and autologous (n = 2), mean age 8.7 years, of whom 50% were African American, 3% Asian, 21% Caucasian, 13% Latino, and 13% mixed race. Forty-seven percent of patients developed AKI within the first 2 years of HCT. Increased risk for AKI was associated with a lower pre-transplant creatinine level (p = 0.001), abnormal pretransplant BUN (p = 0.019) and an unrelated donor (p = 0.022) while preparative regimen intensity, race, or primary disease were not. Twenty-six percent of patients developed AKI within 30 days of HCT. Of those with AKI, 41% were exposed to either cidofovir, aminoglycosides, and/or ambisome for at least 5 days versus 18% without AKI and 74% were exposed to vancomycin compared to 49% without AKI. Evaluating outcomes at 1 year after HCT, of those with stage 1 AKI: 10% had reduced GFR and 37% died, while 14% had reduced GFR and 43% had died for patients with AKI stage 2 or 3. The absence of AKI by day 30 was associated with 24% reduced GFR and 8% death at 1-year after HCT. Overall, those with AKI at any time in the first year post-HCT had a 3.7 fold increased risk of death compared to those without. For patients who required renal replacement therapy (RRT, n = 8), the risk of death was 19.5 fold greater compared to those who did not. In the 25% of patients who survived RRT, both recovered renal function within 2 years.Conclusion: Acute kidney injury is common after pediatric HCT, and may be associated with low creatinine, abnormal BUN, unrelated donor pre-HCT, and renal toxic medications. Early-onset AKI post HCT is associated with an increased risk of mortality. These data should be validated in a larger prospective study but may offer opportunities to intervene and enhance outcomes.",

Efficacy of PCA was evaluated on PCA day + 3, +7, +14, +21 using demands %, maximum pain score (rFLACC, FACES, VAS) and subjective patient, parent and/or pain team perception of pain control. We devised a scale based on the above to designate pain control as good, moderate or poor. Variables being analyzed include recipient age, sex, donor type, source, diagnosis, TBI use, GVHD/TRM. this analysis, we analyze the depth of remission, CAR-T persistence, and post-transplant GVHD on our phase I anti-CD22 CAR-T protocol (NCT02315612) to better understand the role of CAR-T in the peri-HCT setting.Design/Method: Children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD22+ ALL treated on our phase I anti-CD22 CAR-T protocol were analyzed. MRD was assessed by flow cytometry (FC) in all, with PCR-based MRD analysis using IgH or TCR testing assessed in select patients. HCTs were performed at each patient's local institution based on standard of care and included varying conditioning regimens, donor types, stem cell source, and GVHD prophylaxis.Results: On our CD22 CAR trial, 36 patients were treated, the majority of patients (n = 29) having relapsed following a prior HCT. 23/36 patients (64%) attained a CR, 18 of whom were MRD negative by FC. Concurrent PCR based MRD analysis available in 8 patients demonstrated that all patients achieved PCR based negativity. In 6, this was simultaneous with the 1 month MRD negative FC, and in 2, PCR negativity was achieved over time (FC remained negative). 4 patients proceeded to HCT at a median time of 70 days (range: 54-117 days) post-CAR-T, which was a first HCT in 2. These two patients remain in an MRD negative CR, 1 year post-CAR-T. No patients developed acute or chronic GVHD. CAR persistence was seen in 3 patients who had detectable CAR-T cells on the pre-HCT marrow suggesting the possibility of ongoing anti-leukemia surveillance prior to initiation of the conditioning regimen.Conclusion: By inducing PCR negativity, CAR-T therapy may have a synergistic role with HCT to improve leukemia free survival, prior to emergence of antigen negative leukemia, without an increased risk of GVHD. While the sample size is small, CAR-T therapy may offer an effective bridge to HCT, particularly for those who are PCR negative, and those who have not had a previous transplant. Given the underlying risk of HCT related TRM, pre-HCT CAR may potentially allow for HCT conditioning de-intensification as it may not be needed to eradicate residual disease.1 Lee DW, ASH abstract 218, 2016 ",

Outcomes for PTLD are suboptimal with relapse rates approaching 50%. However, EBV-infected B cells in PTLD express the EBV antigens LMP1 and LMP2 that can be targeted with immune therapy.Objectives: We hypothesize that third party \"off the shelf\" LMP-specific T cell products may improve outcomes and decrease associated co-morbidities for patients with PTLD by not only target the lymphoproliferating EBV-infected B cells but also restoring EBV-specific immunity.Design/Method: LMP-specific T cells (LMP-TCs) are manufactured from eligible donors with a broad range of HLA types in our GMP facility to be used in a Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial (ANHL1522) for patients with PTLD after SOT. LMP-TC products are manufactured from healthy donors using autologous monocytes and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing \u0394LMP1 and LMP2 as antigen presenting cells. LMP-TC products undergo comprehensive characterization by IFN-ELISPOT assay to determine LMPspecific epitopes, Class I and/or II response, and HLA restriction to guide selection of LMP-TC product for each patient.Results: Thus far, 27 LMP-TC products have been manufactured. LMP-TCs were active against LMP2 (mean: 158 SFU/1 \u00d7 10^5 cells; range: 1-800), LMP1 (31; 0-355), and LCL (105; 0-424) as determined by IFN-ELISPOT assay. At the time of cryopreservation, the LMP-TC products comprised a mean of 36% CD8+ T-cells, 45% CD4+ T-cells, and 8% NK cells. No B cells or monocytes were detected in the final products. Thus far, we have identified 3 novel LMP epitopes (LMP1 specific: n = 1; LMP2 specific: n = 2). Approximately 80% of the LMP-TC products have LMP-specific activity through multiple HLA alleles, and 67% have a mixed Class I and Class II response. Conclusion: Thus, LMP-specific T cell products can be expanded from healthy donors to creat a third party bank, and identifying epitopes and HLA alleles with LMP activity will facilitate selecting the most appropriate product for patients. While LMP-specific T cells have previously demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase I studies, ANHL1522 is the first trial using cellular therapy within a cooperative group setting.",

Background: In hematopoietic transplantation, the T lymphocytes of the inoculum play a determining role in promoting hematopoiesis, transferring immunity to pathogens and acting as mediators of the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). However, they are also responsible for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the main cause of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. The depletion of CD45 RA lymphocytes, by eliminating naive T lymphocytes from the inoculum, aims to conserve the GVL without producing GVHD.Design/Method: Since April 2016, 14 patients (8 boys and 6 girls), with a median age of 8 years, have undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic transplant from an HLA donor identical with CD45 RA/CD19 depletion. The indication for transplant was: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4), acute myeloblastic leukemia (4), myelodysplasia (5) and medullary aplasia (1). The donor was familiar in 4 cases and unrelated in 10. The conditioning regimen was with fludarabine, busulfan and thiotepa. The median of CD34 + cells infused was 6.82 \u00d7 10 6 / Kg. On the day 0, +15 and +30 a programmed infusion of 1 \u00d7 106 / Kg lymphocytes CD45RA-was performed.Results: All the patients grafted with a median leukocyte (> 0.5 \u00d7 109 / L) and platelet (> 20 \u00d7 109 / L) engraftment time of 15 and 10 days, respectively.

Immune reconstitution was early and rapid in all T cell subsets No patient has relapsed so far and only 1 patient with myelodysplasia has developed an AML. She has received a 2nd transplant and has died of relapse. There was no case of toxic mortality. The event-free survival (SLE) was 90 \u00c2\u00b1 10% with a median follow-up of 10 months.

The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation developed a task force to establish consensus guidelines for defining patient care in HSCT and advocated for further studies to delineate safe procedural steps as an increasing amount of HSCT are being offered to patients. There is limited evidence to support engraftment in recipients who receive their infusions via IV or syringe pump. We present novel data from patients who achieved neutrophil engraftment following HSCT by a pump mechanism.Objectives: To provide evidence supporting the use of pump (intravenous or syringe) infusion method in hematopoietic stem cell transplantations.Design/Method: A retrospective review was completed for 114 patients who underwent HSCT between 2003 and 2012. Inclusion criteria included patients who had received hematopoietic stem cell transplants between 2003 and 2012 and who were ages 6 months to 21 years old. The main outcome measure was days to neutrophil engraftment (defined as the first of three consecutive days with an ANC > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L).Results: Among 114 patients who received infusion of hematopoietic stem cell products via pump mechanism, 63 patients (55.3%) received autologous products and 51 (44.7%) received stem cells from allogeneic donors.

The mean number of days to engraftment for patients who received allogeneic infusions S301 of S301 Design/Method: A retrospective chart review was performed at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimate for OS, Mann-Whitney Test for comparing outcomes between subjects, and descriptive analyses.Results: From 2005-2016, 14 patients with a median age of 7.5 (4.3-23.0) years at 1 st HCT were identified. Patients were conditioned with CY/ATG (n = 3), CY/FLU/ATG (n = 6), or CY/FLU/ATG/TBI (n = 5) and received marrow (n = 13) or cord blood (n = 1) with median CD34/kg dose of 6.82 (1.88-10.90) \u00d710 6 . Two patients developed grade I acute graftversus-host disease (GVHD); none developed chronic GVHD. Due to dropping chimerism, graft rejection, or graft failure, 2 nd HCT (n = 9) or boost (n = 5) was offered. The median CD3 chimerism prior to HCT/boost was 53 (0-100)%. Median time between 1 st HCT and 2 nd HCT or boost was 134 days (42 days-5.1 years). In 9 patients receiving 2 nd HCT, 5 used the same donor, of which 3 used the same stem cell source (marrow) and 2 switched to peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). In 4 patients who switched donors, 3 used PBSC and 1 used cord blood. Most patients receiving 2nd HCT underwent a uniform conditioning regimen of CY200/FLU150/equine ATG/8 Gy TLI (n = 5) or CY120/FLU120/rabbit ATG/2 Gy TBI (n = 3); one received CY/ATG. Acute and chronic GVHD (limited seen in 83%) developed in 50% and 43% of patients, respectively. Four patients required 18 additional boosts and 1 additional HCT.
